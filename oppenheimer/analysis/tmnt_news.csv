2023-08-03 18:00:00+00:00,Review: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,,"I wouldn’t go as far to say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is the most faithful movie adaptation of the cult comic-turned-pop culture juggernaut. But dammit to hell — it’s the funniest.
Co-written and produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, two Canadians who have become millionaires by making entertainment we can all enjoy while high, this Turtles installment doesn’t even try to take itself seriously. (It makes perfect sense that Rogen and Goldberg would do a Turtles movie, since the whole premise always seemed like something you and your friend would come up with while hella baked.)
Along with director Jeff Rowe (who co-helmed the anarchic, satirical animated comedy The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and several other screenwriters, Rogen and Goldberg craft a more farcical take on Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s crime-fighting, sewer-dwelling reptiles from the Big Apple. For starters, just like a lot of New Yorkers, these turtles are some shit-talking, pop culture-savvy smart-asses. Watch as fearful leader Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), a bespectacled Donatello (Micah Abbey), an impulsive Raphael (Brady Noon), and the melon-headed Michelangelo (Shamon Brown, Jr.) bust each other’s balls — do turtles even have balls? — as they go from stealth scavengers to reluctant superheroes. They got their fighting styles from Bruce Lee movies and karate video tutorials provided by their human-hating “father” Splinter (Jackie Chan, but plays the wise rat more as a cranky, Jewish uncle). And the April O’Neil in this story is not a vivacious redhead or Megan Fox, but a nerdy teen of color (The Bear’s Ayo Edebiri) who hopes her story on the Turtles will make her classmates forget that time she lost her lunch during morning announcements.
Mayhem has more in common with “N***a Turtles,” the R-rated, viral-video series where someone chopped up those first two, cheesy Turtles movies from the ‘90s and dubbed over the voices so everyone, including the Turtles, sounded like foul-mouthed hoodrats. While Mayhem doesn’t have its mind completely in the gutter (after all, the Turtles are voiced by actual teens), it does exhibit the same gonzo, anything-for-a-laugh attitude. It’s a movie where Ice Cube voices the main villain, mutant terrorist Superfly, and plays him not as a sinister beast but as a self-centered, wannabe thug. He also has a gang of familiar antagonists, voiced by Rogen and many of his cohorts (Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Hannibal Buress). Since this is a Rogen/Goldberg production, I’m gonna assume ad-libbing was encouraged.
Much like the humor, the computer-generated animation is pleasantly crude. While the filmmakers have said they wanted the animation to have the same jagged, unfinished feel of doodles from a teenager’s notebook, Mayhem looks more like a Laika movie without the stop-motion animation. But that animation isn’t the only thing that’s proudly adolescent. After years of animated and live-action versions which usually characterized the turtles as brolic, roided-out goons (that’s one of the reasons I stayed away from the Michael Bay-produced reboots), Mayhem actually focuses on the fact that they’re teenagers, longing for a normal, teenage life. (Watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off at an outdoor screening really makes them moony-eyed).
Just like that other brilliant, animated movie about a teenage superhero that dropped this summer, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a crafty, comical story about teenagers going through the usual teen stuff — trying to fit in, discovering who you are, etc. Unfortunately, all this happens while they also try to save a city that may not love them back. While this movie ends on an almost cloyingly positive note, it does leave the door open for a new installment and a new, more recognizable villain. As long as it’s just as ass-out funny as the last one, then let the mayhem continue.

2023-08-05 12:37:00+00:00,Does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Have a Post-Credits Scene?,The animated reboot 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' teases the return of an old villain in a mid-credits sequence. Here's what to know.,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been knocking around pop culture, kicking ass and eating pizza, for four decades—and the new animated movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, reboots the franchise for a new generation.
This time around, the heroes in a half shell Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey and Shamon Brown Jr., while their friend and ally, budding reporter April O'Neill, is played by The Bear's Ayo Edebiri. Martial arts movie star Jackie Chan plays their adoptive father Splinter, and the movie's main antagonist Superfly is voiced by Ice Cube, backed up by a supporting cast of impressive cameo voices which include Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Maya Rudolph, and Seth Rogen, who also co-wrote the script.
While Mutant Mayhem is a self-contained movie and offers up a fresh version of the turtles' origin story, this project was also clearly designed to set up future installments in the franchise. And if there's one thing that we've all learned from over a decade of Marvel movies, it's that there's no way to tease a sequel like including a stinger after the credits.

Does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have a post-credits sequence?
The movie does feature an epilogue, but don't worry, you won't have to stay seated and wait for the entire credits to roll before seeing it.
Spoilers ahead:
In a mid-credits sequence which plays almost as soon as the film is over, we catch up with Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo in a video diary as all four brothers adjust to their new life at high school, even attending prom, while April continues her investigation into TCRI.
But then the audience viewpoint pans away from the turtles, and we see that they are being spied on by TCRI executive Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who still harbors a grudge against all mutants created by the ""ooze"" which transformed the turtles. But she is not alone: the final shot of the mid-credits scene reveals the silhouette of the Shredder, arguably the most iconic villain in TMNT history, who will undoubtedly be causing trouble when the sequel comes around.

,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie review (2023),There are undeniably strong visuals here and enough creative voice work to make it tolerable on a hot August day when families are looking for an air-conditioned theater for a few hours.,"Yes, it’s another origin story. Despite being the seventh film to feature these characters, Rowe and co-writers Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg go back to the beginning of the TMNT saga, opening with a scientist named Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) creating the infamous ooze that turns ordinary creatures into mutants. When the authorities break into Baxter’s basement lair, the ooze is spilled into the sewers, and the rest is comic book history as a quartet of turtles becomes fast-talking humanoid creatures named Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Raphael (Brady Noon).
Fans of the franchise know that the turtles are nothing without their leader, Splinter (Jackie Chan), a rat who was also transformed by the ooze and became the father to the teenage mutants after teaching them the ninja skills to protect themselves. Splinter is extremely overprotective, ordering the boys to stay away from human beings at all costs or risk being milked by them (don't ask). A flashback reveals that Splinter tried to introduce himself and the turtles to the humans, but they were somewhat understandably terrified. Now they all live underground, as the turtles sneak out to get supplies and wish they could have a normal teenage life beyond the sewers.
Meanwhile, one of Baxter’s experiments responds very differently to the chasm between the human race and the mutants now living underground. Whereas Splinter wants to hide, Superfly (Ice Cube) wants something closer to vengeance. He’s assembled a group of mutants that include Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Rocksteady (John Cena), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Ray Fillet (Post Malone), Bebop (Seth Rogen), and Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd). Throw in Maya Rudolph as a mysterious figure trying to find the turtles and Ayo Edebiri as April, the human being who befriends the turtles and tries to introduce them to the above-ground world, and you have a stellar voice cast. Once Superfly and his cadre of creatures join the action, “Mutant Mayhem” gets exponentially more fun as each great actor is allowed fun voice beats to shine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 16:00:00+00:00,"'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' review: An action-packed, utterly goofy nostalgia trip","Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen lend their voices. Movie review.","If you grew up on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon show from the '80s, worshipped the live-action movies from the '90s, or still could chant the chorus of Vanilla Ice's ""Ninja Rap,"" then Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is for you.
A jubilant celebration of the comic book characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, this latest reboot reimagines the titular turtles in an animated coming-of-age action-comedy that pays tribute to their heyday while carving out fresh fun by looping in a wide array of wild characters.
That means if you've got a kiddo who's into TMNT, they'll eat this up like the boys do pizza.
What's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem about?
Credit: Paramount Pictures
The basic bones of the original story is familiar: four baby turtles chilling in the sewers of New York City come across some mysterious ooze, as does a fully grown rat. When the glowing green goo turns the lot of them into animal-human hybrids, the rat named Splinter (voiced here by Jackie Chan) decides to raise the subterranean hatchlings, naming them Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.).
Setting this version apart, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem features a Splinter who is not the sage-like sensei of past incarnations, but a fussy, overprotective dad, traumatized by his interactions with humans. (As a rat in New York, he's got plenty of bad experiences with our lot.) So, to be sure his shelled wards will be safe, he trains them in martial arts, learned from live-action movies and YouTube tutorials. (Yes, live-action movies exist in this cartoon movie. We'll get back to this.)
However, Splinter and the boys aren't the only mutants battling to just exist in this city. A family of on-the-run experimental hybrids is stirring up trouble: pulling bold heists and killing off human criminals. Their leader is Superfly (Ice Cube), who is a flyman. The rest of the crew includes such wacky canonical characters as the batty Wingnut (What We Do In the Shadows' Natasia Demetriou, the crocodilian Leatherface (Rose Byrne), the warthog and rhino twosome of BeBop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena), the endlessly singing Ray Fillet (Post Malone), the grumbly Genghis Frog (Hannibal Burress), and a skater lizard called Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd).
This crew is on the run from a nefarious corporation, Techno Cosmic Research Institute, whose scowling leader Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph doing a vaguely Dr. Ruth voice), wants to weaponize their mutant DNA. Meanwhile, the turtles have made a human friend, high school paper reporter April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and so are fixing to bring down this mutant crime syndicate to get her prom uncanceled — and to be able to introduce themselves to the humans they hide from as heroes.
Is that a lot of plot? Yes. Is the movie a bit of a mad jumble because of it? Also, yes. But with ""mayhem"" in the title, what more do you expect?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is chaotic entertainment.

This lively reboot is a raucous collage of influences, the foremost of which are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and their cavalcade of kooky characters and outrageous backstories. But whether you're an expert on the canon or not, the movie sets up all you need to follow its flow. Deep-cut fans will surely pull out references and implications, but newbies won't be lost amid the flood of characters, in part because their main purpose is to be a tornado of energy, action, and comedy.
Deep-cut fans will surely pull out references and implications, but newbies won't be lost amid the flood of characters.
That comedy comes in no small part from Rogen and Evan Goldberg (Superbad), who produced this reboot, writing the script along Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit, and Jeff Rowe (Mitchells vs. The Machines), who co-directed with Kyler Spears (a storyboard artist from Mitchells vs. The Machines). Rogen and Goldberg seemed to have a heavy hand in casting, considering the voice acting ensemble is stacked with past collaborators like Byrne, Burress, Rudd, Rudolph, Chan, and Cube. Within Superfly's family, there's an endless supply of energy, silliness, and one-liners, which makes for frenzied fun whether they're fighting, going bowling, or jamming out to 4 Non-Blondes in a van.
Rowe and Spears enhance this energy with an animation style that proudly shuns the polished look of the movie's peers. Throughout the film, settings, props, and characters are drawn with slaps and color, and scribbles that emphasize the human hands involved in their making. (Think the drafting lines in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.) This style brings texture and personality into every frame of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, reminding audiences that there are far more interesting things that can be done with computer animation beyond the bland accuracy of photorealism.
Beyond this, Row and Spears re-imagine the turtles to look less like the same action figures with different accessories. Mostly likely to brawl Raphael has a stockier build and a missing tooth (presumably from horseplay). Timid leader Leonardo is a bit taller and leaner, while anime-loving Donatello has a scrawnier build and glasses. And Michelangelo — often written as the pesky runt of the litter — is the smallest, with a watermelon-like noggin and braces. These little distinctions give them definitions from the start. And while long-time fans might bristle that Raph's dropped his brooding or Mikey's lost his surfer slang, these incarnations still feel true to the overall vibe of the turtles — they're brothers first and foremost, and it's an absolute joy to watch them play and battle.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a tale of family overcoming prejudice.

Sure, there's plenty of action in this movie, from car chases to martial arts battles to a multi-boro sprawling climactic battle for — not just the future of prom but — the future of mankind. Much like Rowe's Mitchells vs. The Machines, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem embraces disparate design styles, like folding in live-action clips, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off — to give the turtles' world an invigorating sense that anything can happen.
Within that promise is a message of hope, as two chosen families fight for their safety in a world that sees their very existence as a threat. Humans in the film are presented (fairly) as being typically scared and thereby hateful toward anything different from them, anything they don't understand. Splinter and Superfly both have horrid brushes with mankind, but to protect their families, they pursue very different routes: one wants to hide, and the other wants to hit back. (Think Prof X versus Magneto in the X-Men movies.)
The allegory here might go over kids' heads, but grown-ups won't miss it. And to the directors' credit, the casting of Ice Cube is brilliant. He is absolutely dynamic whether Superfly is dropping familiar rap lyrics , hyping up his hybrid siblings, or preaching human annihilation. And his cohorts bring vibrant life to their lovable weirdos. Rogen and Cena get growly and goofy; Byrne is gamely broad as a gator girl, while Rudd is sublimely silly as the daffy gecko, who is achingly '90s in his idea of cool.
Their collective love is reflected in the turtles, whose child voice actors give a youthful exuberance to every scene, which is smartly paired with a no-nonsense Edebiri (who is crushing it this summer between this, The Bear, and Bottoms). Chan completes the picture as the father who loves so much but can't let go. And so amid the dizzying flurry of action and eye-popping animation, there's a dedicatedly sweet story that keeps us bound to the eponymous heroes, whatever wild turns they take.
With a plotline that scrambles across New York City, characters that seem born from a bad acid trip, and a sense of humor that is unapologetically madcap, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a hyper-active romp that's chaotically charming. Kids will love the bombastic humor and gonzo — though not gory — action. Grown-ups will get the added bonus of nostalgia, not only for the turtles but also through a soundtrack that boasts jams like ""No Diggity,"" ""What's Going On,"" and ""Can I Kick It?""
Altogether, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a wild ride that is sure to please fans old and new.

2023-08-06 11:30:09+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem review – gloriously anarchic reboot,"With its refreshingly glitchy animation style and superb hip-hop soundtrack, the reptilian superheroes’s latest outing is a fizzing treat","Perhaps it’s the Spider-Verse effect, but mainstream animation for kids seems to be going through a period of rare visual creativity. The latest revamp of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, directed by Jeff Rowe, is a case in point. The story is a fairly generic origin tale-meets-mutant-apocalypse: the turtles are chafing against the overprotective love of their humanoid-rat father figure, Master Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan), but have yet to find a way to win the approval of the human world. The animation style, however, is gloriously anarchic: a scratchy, glitchy, scrawling onslaught that has more in common with the Biro’d graffiti on a high school bathroom door than it does with the immaculate 3D realism that has, until recently, been the norm for big-budget animation.
There’s a pleasing messiness to it all, a sense of barely controlled chaos that is matched by the jostling, overlapping voice performances. The nostalgic 80s and 90s hip-hop soundtrack is sublime, and while the action sequences can be hard to follow, there’s no faulting the film’s fizzing energy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvYXVnLzA2L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1yZXZpZXctZ2xvcmlvdXNseS1hbmFyY2hpYy1yZWJvb3TSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2F1Zy8wNi90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmV2aWV3LWdsb3Jpb3VzbHktYW5hcmNoaWMtcmVib290?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-29 10:00:00-04:00,All the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2 news we’ve heard so far,"TMNT: Mutant Mayhem is getting a sequel and an animated follow-up show on Paramount Plus, and Shredder’s on his way. Here’s everything we know about it.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have shredded their way back onto the big screen in the new animated movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. But, as you might expect for the band of half-shelled martial artists, there’s always another bad guy to fight and another crime to stop, and that means a sequel.
Mutant Mayhem gives us the origin story of the Turtles and has them face off against quite a few adversaries, but it’s also got a sequel tease that sets up the biggest bad guy the Turtles have ever had. Here’s everything we know so far about the follow ups to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, including the sequel and the animated show.
Is there going to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2?
Yes! The sequel to the new Turtles film, produced by Seth Rogen, was already greenlit before the first movie was even released. Even better, it’s also getting a follow-up in the form of an animated TV series that, according to Variety, will “bridge” the two films. The show is set to stream on Paramount Plus, and will run for two seasons.
When will Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2 come out?
This is a good question, and one that we don’t have an exact answer for. Given that the show is supposed to bridge the gap between the first movie and its sequel, we can probably say that that the second film is at least two years away. But who knows? It could be even more than that. It takes a long time to make animated films that look good!
[Ed. note: The rest of this piece contains spoilers for TMNT: Mutant Mayhem’s credits scene.]
What will Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2 be about?
This is where the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem credits scene comes into play. During that scene, we get our first glimpse of this story’s Shredder. Director Jeff Rowe said that while his crew initially thought about making Shredder the big bad of Mutant Mayhem, they felt like that wouldn’t give either the Turtles or their archrival the origin story they deserved — and the Turtles were obviously priority one. But that means that Shredder is coming up fast on the Turtles’ list of adversaries.
So is Shredder the villain of the TV show or the movie?
This is a tougher question. It could be that Shredder’s the villain of both — he’s certainly cool enough to be. Wherever he actually shows up, the good news (or bad news) is that we know Shredder is on the way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODExMzU4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS0yLXJlbGVhc2UtbmV3cy1jYXN0LXR2LXNob3ctc2hyZWRkZXLSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjM4MTEzNTgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLTItcmVsZWFzZS1uZXdzLWNhc3QtdHYtc2hvdy1zaHJlZGRlcg?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been a pretty consistent part of the pop culture landscape since Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s scrappy self-published comic became a sensation in the mid-1980s, spawning an iconic animated series and a popular toy line. In the years since, that initial spark of creativity has inspired several distinct animated universes, two live-action film series, a bevy of toys, multiple video games, mountains of comics, and at least one rock music tour.
With all of that in mind, we’re getting a brand new version of the plucky amphibian heroes in the form of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which looks to stoke the fires of 1980s nostalgia and introduce the Turtles to a new generation. If the previews released so far are anything to go by, the film appears to strike the right chords for older TMNT fans while also appealing to their children and – in some cases – grandchildren. Let’s head to the sewers and dredge up everything we know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
The Mutagen Strikes Again

Starting afresh – as opposed to continuing one of the existing film or TV continuities – the film sees the Turtles, after years of seclusion and training, making their way to the surface in the hopes of being embraced by humanity. Befriending April O’Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), the team takes on a reclusive crime syndicate to keep the streets and sewers safe. And, maybe, they’ll find the acceptance they crave along the way.
Some fans may notice the absence of certain details – notably the Foot Clan and the ever-present Turtles nemesis Shredder – but the presence of characters like Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena) suggests those TMNT staples will appear in due course. See also: Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who often appears in Turtles stories as a press-ganged scientist aiding the Foot in the creation of their own mutants. Although, just as often, he willingly helps as it furthers his own aims and research in mutation.
And, as it happens, other mutants will quickly become a cause of concern for the Turtles. Will they be friends or foes? Considering the film is subtitled Mutant Mayhem, expect that question to drive some of the action.
The Sewers and the Streets

Naturally enough, the Turtles inhabit New York. But judging from our first glimpses at the film, it is a stylized New York one might expect Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Miles Morales to visit. Indeed, the art direction was one of the big appeals for long-time fans when a teaser first arrived in March. Distinct from previous iterations of the Turtles, it also feels like a natural path for the comic book-inspired film.
Beyond that, the swift introduction of alien worlds (and aliens) in the original Eastman and Laird comics and the first animated series means there is always room for the Turtles to visit locations less grounded than Manhattan.
Of Turtles And Mutants

Eschewing the typical pattern for the Turtles voice cast – or even long-time voice actors like Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, or Greg Cipes – the film will feature four actual teenagers in the lead roles. The Walking Dead: World Beyond‘s Nicolas Cantu leads as Leonardo, the most dedicated of Master Splinter’s pupils to their training and goals. Micah Abbey lends his voice to generally tech-smart Donatello. Brady Noon of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers brings the attitude as a new Raphael, while Shamon Brown Jr. parties it up as Michelangelo.
Of course, we’re assuming the personalities of the Turtles will remain intact in Mutant Mayhem, but as seen in the teaser trailer, casting a group of young men leads to a noticeably different interpretation of the characters – vocally, at least. Additionally, the group recorded their dialogue together, offering a chance for more improvisation and a greater sense of camaraderie, which we clearly see in the scene of the Turtles goofing off in the teaser.
Beyond the four leads, the film is outfitted with a surprising number of familiar names – many of them playing surprising character pulls from Turtles history. Starting with the most recognizable characters, The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri lends her voice to this version of April O’Neil. The character has had many permutations over the years, from TV anchor to budding reporter to straight-up ninja, so anything is possible with Edebiri and her take on the Turtles’ most constant friend. Jackie Chan takes on the role of Master Splinter, the boys’ sensei and adoptive father.

As mentioned above, the recognizable bad guys include Bebop and Rocksteady, voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena, respectively, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman. Will the latter end up a fly by the end of the film? Time will tell.
Paul Rudd offers his talents as Mondo Gecko, the radical skateboarding lizard who has been part of TMNT lore since 1989. Rose Byrne plays Leatherhead, a mutant alligator who has been both friend and foe to the Turtles over the years. Post Malone voices Ray Fillet, a character who first appeared in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series as “Man-Ray” but soon made his way to the action figure aisles under his subsequent moniker. Hannibal Buress becomes Genghis Frog, one of the original toy line’s attempts at beating imitators to the punch with a group known as the Punk Frogs. Natasia Demetriou takes on Wingnut, a humanoid bat who is sometimes an alien, a mutant, a would-be superhero, or a terrorist, depending on the era and series. Maya Rudolph is Cynthia Utrom – a character who might seem new for the film, but with a last name that fans will certainly recognize and that suggests something very specific about who she might truly be.

And finally, Ice Cube is Superfly, a new addition to the group of mutants to be featured in the film, who is revealed to be the primary villain in the latest trailer. Taking a page out of X-Men nemesis Magneto’s playbook, Superfly asserts that humans will never accept mutants like him and his cohorts, so he’s out to conquer mankind and put mutants in charge. Bebop, Rocksteady, and the others accordingly appear to be on his side.
While all the other mutants certainly pull at the nostalgia strings, the new direction in casting the Turtles voices may be the key thing that opens the characters up to a new generation of fans.

The film is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs The Machines – which he also wrote – and a staff writer on Gravity Falls and Disenchantment. Joining him as co-director is Kyler Spears, who also worked on Mitchells as a storyboard artist; considering their past collaboration, it’s no surprise that Mutant Mayhem feels like the next step in the evolution of the visual style we saw in Mitchells. Rowe also wrote Mutant Mayhem in conjunction with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit.
According to Rogen, part of the intent is to lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the title more heavily than in past iterations, citing movies like Stand By Me as inspiration. Based on the teaser, it definitely appears his intent made it to the finished product.
Rogen and Goldberg serve as producers with Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean as executive producers. Other crew include procution designer Yashar Kassai, character designer James A. Castillo, production supervisor Derek Manzella, and post-production supervisor Ryan Price.

2023-08-01 19:59:00+00:00,How a call from Seth Rogen convinced Ice Cube to join Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,All it took was one sentence to get the actor/singer on board with the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles project.,"Editor’s note: All interviews for this story were conducted prior to the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
How much convincing did it take for Ice Cube to sign on to the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem project?
“One sentence,” Ice Cube said with a smile. “It was like Seth [Rogen] calling me, ‘Hey, Cube! I’m doing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, man. I’ve got a character for you.'”
That character is the movie’s big bad guy, Superfly. As you’d expect, Superfly is just that: a fly. He leads an army of mutants — featuring the voice talents of Paul Rudd, Post Malone, Hannibal Burress, John Cena and Rogen — that go head-to-head with everyone’s favorite heroes in a half shell.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: #MutantMayhem “crushes for every age”! Watch the FINAL Trailer and get #TMNTMovie tickets now! See it in theatres everywhere Wednesday, August 2, Sneak Previews start early in select theatres this Saturday, July 29. https://t.co/ysUtySWkv1 pic.twitter.com/Lnl6PCJWk0 — TMNT (@TMNTMovie) July 27, 2023
Early returns from sneak previews over the weekend indicate that the movie is headed for success. As of August 1, Mutant Mayhem sits at 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with 74 reviews.
“It was a no brainer,” Ice Cube said. “I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It’s like being drafted on a winning championship team dynasty. You would be a fool to turn this down.”
From the jump, Ice Cube connected with Superfly, even if the drawing didn’t quite match up with what he had in mind. “I thought when [Seth Rogen] said Superfly, I thought it was pimp hat. I thought it was Cadillac, and then he sent me to picture, and I’m like, ‘Oh, damn, he is a super ugly fly.’ I knew I could make him cool and make him the kingpin that he is running New York and causing mayhem.”
Ice Cube is not new to acting, having starred in roles from Friday (1995) to Anaconda (1997) to 21 Jump Street (2014) and many in between. He’s also an old pro in the recording studio, including his work on N.W.A.’s Straight Outta Compton (1988), It Was a Good Day (1992) and You Can Do It (2007).
But acting in the studio? That’s a bit of a different beast. One that Ice Cube enjoyed immensely. “I just went in the booth, put on my cape like I usually do like. In hip hop you’re in there by yourself most of the time anyway,” Cube explained. “What was cool is he had us working together. So, I was working directly with the turtles. And you know, it made for better voiceovers and better interaction.”
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hits theaters nationwide on Wednesday, August 2.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZnR3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtaWNlLWN1YmUtc3VwZXJmbHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-18 18:55:46.343000,Is ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ good for kids?,Teens want to see characters more authentic to their lived experience,"“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” hit theaters earlier this month and is the latest addition to what has turned out to be a very fun summer at the movies.
The film features turtle brothers Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael and Donatello who became mutants as infants after being exposed to mutant-ooze created by a lonely scientist trying to form his own family of mutant animals.
They are raised in a sewer by Splinter, their adoptive mutant-rat father who trains them in martial arts after being ostracized by the human world above ground. The turtles befriend April, a human teenager, who helps them uncover, and foil, another mutant’s evil plan to destroy humanity.
There is much to love about the latest version of “TMNT” from creators Seth Rogan, Jeff Rowe and Evan Goldberg. My family and I saw it the weekend the film opened, and we all had different reasons for enjoying it.
The movie is full of throwback treats for elder millennials like my husband and myself who grew up watching the original cartoon series. I knew Michelangelo as a turtle first and as an Renaissance artist second. The soundtrack features some of the greatest hits from our childhood like “No Diggity” from Blackstreet and “Can I Kick It?” from A Tribe Called Quest.
My 8- and 4-year-olds enjoyed the age-appropriate humor and thrilling action sequences. My tween, who is an aspiring illustrator, loved the animation style similar to what she’d seen in “Mitchells Vs. The Machines” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”
Writer-director Jeff Rowe calls the purposefully less-than-perfect animation “a reaction to a 30-year trend in 3D CG animation to push towards photorealism and hyper-realistic lighting and texturing,” in an interview with Variety. “We decided we wanted this movie to look exactly like concept artwork, and we want the concept artwork to feel distinctly human and not computer-generated.”
“Distinctly human” is the term that best identifies what’s at the heart of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” somewhat paradoxically, with four turtles and their adopted father, who is a human-sized rat, in starring roles.
While the film spoke to my entire family, I believe it can speak best, like no previous version of “TMNT” has, to teens, the demographic at the center of the movie. Anyone between the ages of 12 and 18 will likely see themselves in the gangly, awkward and not yet fully formed turtles. This is a change from the cartoons of my youth.
Back then, the turtles were teens in name only. They had rippling muscles and spoke in the deep tones of the voice actors who portrayed them. This is how entertainment for children and teens has almost always been done — actors in their mid to late 30s often play 16-year-olds in teen media, and screenwriters and producers well into adulthood write scripts with dialogue unlike anything real teens actually say. Awkward female characters suddenly become beautiful women after one makeover and a dramatic removal of their glasses. Misfit young men become popular, grown males with one successful football pass.
When I became a teenager, I felt confused when I didn’t look like those 30-year-olds pretending to be in high school and instead looked (and felt) like I was stuck in a pubescent limbo between childhood and adulthood. Finding the right friends and a real sense of belonging was more complicated than my film and television consumption had led me to believe.
I would have appreciated more media representation of teens who were still growing into themselves, physically and emotionally, not teens played by actors in their late 20s saying lines written by studio executives who have no memory of how teenhood actually felt.
A recent survey published in UC Berkeley’s “Greater Good Magazine” found that most media created for teens does not feel authentic to the viewers in the demographic it targets. “Movies and television shows typically targeting American adolescents are often made without a committed consideration of their perspectives,” the authors wrote. “American teenagers now want to see Hollywood content with authentic, inclusive, and positive storytelling that better reflects their true lives and families.”
Yes, the protagonists of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” are cartoon turtles, but they feel authentically teen in the way they just want to be good to each other, make their dad proud and find community among their (human) peers.
The turtles are voiced by four actual teens — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon — and are drawn as lanky with glasses and braces (there must be orthodontists and optometrists in the New York sewer systems). All they really want is to go to high school, make cool videos for social media and attend their prom without disappointing their dad. April, voiced by Ayo Adebiri, just wants to get past an embarrassing vomiting episode on the school news broadcast.
These are the concerns of real teenagers who spend their time doing homework, eating dinner with their family, and finding like-minded buddies. The authors of the Berkeley study write, “Contrary to stereotypical notions of teenage angst and self-absorption ... adolescents are leaning toward stories that provide hope and knowledge of others while also remaining fun and authentic for their age.”
Those adolescents will do well to lean toward the story told through the four teenage mutant ninja turtles.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tLzIwMjMvOC8xOC8yMzgyMzM3MS90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tdGVlbi1yZXByZXNlbnRhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 19:49:00.876000+00:00,Over 20 Minutes of Fresh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Footage Shown at SDCC,"Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies revealed over 20 minutes of new footage for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con, and IGN was in the audience to take it all in.","Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies revealed over 20 minutes of new footage from upcoming animated movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con, and IGN was in the audience to take it all in. Here’s what we saw (spoilers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem follow!).
The footage kicked off with a clip IGN premiered last week in which the Turtles suit up before preparing to stealthily go grocery shopping. Here's that clip, in case you missed it:
Loading Play
From there, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael enter a bodega and try to dodge security cameras while shoplifting supplies and food. Job done, the Turtles hitch a ride back to Manhattan on a truck roof. A news report displayed on an enormous screen reveals crime is rising under a mastermind known as Superfly.
The Turtles watch an outdoor screening of 1980s coming of age classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which is live-action while the audience is animated. “Maybe one day everyone will love us like they love Ferris Bueller,” one Turtle laments. The quartet wistfully stare at the movie screen and audience before they escape into the sewers.
The Turtles try to sneak home but a wide-awake Splinter catches them. Of course, Leo owns up to their late night shenanigans. You can see a short clip of this scene in the video below:
Loading Play
Splinter, being Splinter, admonishes the Turtles for risking interaction with humans. Splinter recounts his origin to teach them a valuable lesson about humans. He says humans are the worst - his best friend was a cockroach who was stepped on. We then see Splinter eat his cockroach friend. What’s a rat going to do?
Splinter discovers four adorable baby turtles in the sewer in the green ooze fans know all too well. They transform. Splinter’s transformation is like body horror. Splinter raises the toddler turtles via an adorable montage. We see bath time, all the Turtles sleeping in Splinter’s bed, and their curiosity about the outside world even as kids. Enamoured, Splinter grants the Turtles a trip to the human world.
In Times Square, Splinter is carrying the kids when a woman bumps into him. Soon the whole crowd freaks out and chase Splinter and the Turtles off. They’re almost run over by vehicles as they make their escape. After the incident, Splinter swears to protect the Turtles, training them during a typical martial arts movie montage.
We shift back to the present, when Splinter grounds the Turtles for a month. They’re unhappy, as you’d expect. Donnie asks Leo if it was worth it, which saddens him. We see the Turtles lying in their bads wondering what they’d do if they were normal. They could go to the prom, they suggest, before discounting the possibility.
Now we’re out in NYC at dusk. A human “road crew” working for Superfly pulls a heist on an armored truck and steals what was inside. Police chase after the road crew’s truck. Suddenly, a winged creature seizes the truck and flies off with it to a hidden location. Turns out the creature is Superfly, who we presume eats the crew. We see what was stolen: a mysterious radioactive device.
We cut to Maya Rudolph’s character who, at a headquarters, dishes out tracking units to vehicles to try to catch up to Superfly. The Turtles, meanwhile, are on a rooftop. Donnie is holding a watermelon over his head so the brothers can enjoy a spot of target practice. The Turtles hear a crash below, caused by an errant ninja star. The crash involved a scooter belonging to… April! Someone steals the scooter - Leo insists he retrieve it for this beautiful and charming human woman. The turtles leap into action and chase the thief back to a chop shop.
The Turtles, who have never been in a real fight before, draw their weapons. Mikey gets a ninja star in his leg before the human thieves initiate a brawl. The Turtles use whatever they can to fight. “Go, Ninja, Go!” plays at one point. The fight trashes the chop shop.
Eventually, the Turtles emerge victorious and find April’s scooter. When April walks in the Turtles hide in the shadows. April says they’re “sus” for doing so. Slowly, the Turtles enter the light. April thinks they’re human crime fighters in turtle costumes. “Can we explain this over pizza?” one Turtle says. “How do you feel about pepperoni?” April replies. “I didn’t think it would get this far,” Donnie says.
That’s the end of the footage! The panel also saw TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman deliver a special announcement: Nickelodeon and Paramount have secured the rights to run the original series starting next year.
We end with another clip from Mutant Mayhem. We see April and the Turtles in a stakeout of a meeting of the mutants. “I’m going to win a daytime Emmy,” April says to herself as she records the meeting on her phone.
Superfly confronts the Turtles. “I can’t believe there are other mutants like us,” Mikey says. Superfly says the same ooze that made the Turtles made Superfly and his crew, and reveals his “dad”, Baxter Stockman, is the one who dumped the ooze in the sewer. Mondo Gecko hugs the Turtles. “I’m a hugger,” he says. They go on about liking each other’s vibe.
In another clip, we see the Turtles are very much not down with Superfly’s plan to kill all the humans.
That’s it for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem footage shown at San Diego Comic-Con. The movie comes out in cinemas August 2, 2023.

2023-08-03 15:46:19.733000+00:00,Mutant Mayhem is a grody and gorgeous reintroduction to the TMNT,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem knocks it out of the park with a straightforward story elevated by phenomenally inspired art direction and sharp action.,"There has seldom been a moment during the past 20 years when there wasn’t a relatively new spin on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles airing on TV, playing in movie theaters, or appearing in comic books, which is part of what made director Jeff Rowe’s Mutant Mayhem animated feature such a curious surprise when it was first announced. With there being so many different modern takes on the characters first created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, it wasn’t all that clear what more that could be done with them that 4Kids, Warner Bros., Nickelodeon, and parent company Paramount hadn’t already tried multiple times over.
Narratively, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is such a classic and straightforward Turtle tale that it’ll ring almost too familiar to anyone who knows the heroes in a half shell — especially those who’ve kept up with the franchise over the past couple of years. But between the movie’s delightfully grimy art direction, its hyper-kinetic action sequences, and its quintet of strong, pointedly youthful lead performances, Mutant Mayhem is also hands down one of the most exciting and definitive outings the Ninja Turtles have ever had.
Set largely in the slime-filled sewers of New York City, Mutant Mayhem tells the slightly updated story of how Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) grew up to become pizza-munching, anthropomorphic, reptilian crime fighters after being exposed to mutagenic ooze as ordinary baby turtles.

After years of living in secret and being raised by their similarly mutated adoptive rat-turned-father figure, Splinter (Jackie Chan), the boys all know just how dangerous the surface and the humans who call it home can be for people who aren’t considered “normal.” But as teenage boys who’ve spent their entire lives being forced to hide in the shadows and made to practice their ninjutsu arts strictly for self-defense, the brothers can’t help but be curious about the bright, bustling world above that’s always been just out of their reach.
Almost all of the early beats in Mutant Mayhem’s script from Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit feel like the movie checking off a list of TMNT basics for newcomers. But it breezes through them with a swift and stylish precision that telegraphs Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears’ razor-sharp sense for crafting the bigger, busier action sequences that come later on and brilliantly showcases Arthur Fong and Tiffany Lam Almack’s absolutely stunning art direction.
While the Ninja Turtles have been varying degrees of cute, “cool,” and alarming, throughout their almost 40-year-long history, there’s always been an innate ick factor to them that’s a big part of their appeal. Mutant Mayhem’s Turtles are still a gaggle of sewer-dwelling teenage boys who don’t clean behind their ears because they’re not entirely sure if they have them. But one of Mutant Mayhem’s most brilliant moves is the way it parlays the TMNT brand’s classic grossness into a more expansive grotesque aesthetic that defines the entire world around the Turtles, but — interestingly — not the Turtles themselves.
Unlike the Turtles, who — despite being unique in small ways — all share a recognizable symmetrical wholeness, basically every single human who appears in Mutant Mayhem is rendered as a kind of artfully bizarre nightmare person whose faces all feel like reflections of the city (and humanity’s) ugliness. It’s as true of the innocent strangers the Turtles sneak by during their bodega runs as it is of ​​Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) — the villainous head of the research lab desperately trying to replicate the process that led to the mutagenic ooze’s creation. But it’s not at all the case with high school student April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), whose chance encounter with the Turtles one evening gives them all hope that they might finally have a shot at making some real new friends.
Image: Paramount
Occasionally, Mutant Mayhem might feel a bit too packed with pop culture and brand references for its own good — particularly to older theatergoers who lived through previous corporate marketing blitzes designed to turn people into lifelong Turtles fans. But everything about Mutant Mayhem’s quippy sense of humor, its scribbly / sketchy visual language, and its focus on the Turtles’ obsession with the surface is meant to remind you that — in addition to being mutant ninjas — they’re a bunch of goofy kids that actual children are meant to be able to relate to in an organic way.
It’s exactly the sort of vibe that a reboot meant to kick off a new era of films and spinoff series should have, and while it remains to be seen whether Paramount can really keep this momentum going long term, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the studio’s absolutely knocked it out of the park.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgxNzI5Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Even though it is Barbie’s world yet again for another weekend as it inches closer to $1 billion worldwide, four turtles are chilling for the no. 2 spot at the box office. According to Variety, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem earned $10.2 million on opening day, a.k.a. enough money for, like, 833,000 pizzas which would last probably a month in the sewers of NYC. Produced and co-written by Seth Rogen, the movie follows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo (who are all voiced by real teens) in their, wait for it, teenage antics, as Rogen wanted to emphasize the “teen” in TMNT, especially due to his start with shows like Freaks and Geeks and movies like Superbad. The turtle flick is expected to earn around $35 million to $45 million over the five-day opening, which isn’t bad against its $70 million budget. What a time to be a teen(age mutant ninja turtle).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLWJveC1vZmZpY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 10:00:00-04:00,Seth Rogen did Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Marvel scares him,"Seth Rogen, producer behind The Boys, Invincible, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, plans to stay far away from the Marvel and DC universes.","What does this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie have in common with 2011’s oddball superhero flick The Green Hornet? A name: Seth Rogen.
And while that might not seem like a feather in Mutant Mayhem’s cap, all the other Seth Rogen-produced comic book adaptations between the two do: There’s Preacher, The Boys, and Invincible, with more seasons and spinoffs of the latter two on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem looks to follow that streak.
The four wisecracking, pizza-scarfing turtles have featured in cartoon shows, movies, and toys for so long that it’s easy for their comic book origins to be eclipsed. In 1983, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird assembled their lightly parodic comics series from bits of every blockbuster superhero comic of the time: the teenagers of New Mutants and New Teen Titans; the mutants of the X-Men; and above all, Frank Miller’s Daredevil, from which they borrowed ninjas and martial arts, an origin story involving weird chemicals, a mentor named after a piece of wood, and a faceless horde of bad guys named after a bodily extremity.
Their self-published comic was the kind of sales and licensing success that rocked an industry still stretching its muscles from decades of publishing consolidation. So it’s not merely that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are an evergreen brand — they’re also a shoo-in for Rogen, who has quietly made a second career of racking up hugely successful comic book adaptations not based on Warner Bros. or Disney properties.
Polygon sat down to chat with Rogen in anticipation of the film, which he co-wrote and executive-produced (and for which he recorded the voice of Bebop), and which features the work of director Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and a cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Giancarlo Esposito. Paramount has already announced development on a sequel and a Paramount Plus TV spinoff, making Mutant Mayhem the dawn of a new era of the ever-mutating franchise.
[Ed. note: This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike against the AMPTP went into effect.]
Polygon: My favorite way to talk about TMNT’s arc from comics to a transmedia franchise is to point out that it started with making puns about Daredevil. What do you think it is about this really unique comic about altered reptile karate kids that keeps capturing different generations’ hearts and minds?
Seth Rogen: Someone smart once said all the best ideas start as jokes. And I think that this firmly falls into that category. It started as a way for two comic book writers to make each other laugh, literally. They were they were doodling in their sketchbooks, trying to crack each other up, and that’s where the first images of this came from.
But, like great writers, they imbued it with something that is undeniably relatable and resonant, which is the teenage part. That word is what makes it go from being a silly thing that is disposable, to something that weirdly has resonated with people for 40 years. It’s because they’re teenagers, and they feel this desire to be a part of the normal world, and this desire to be understood, and that they’re fun and kind of reckless and immature. That is really the thing that has made them resonate for so long. To me, it’s the thing that I thought was also the most underexplored. But it started, literally, as a comic book, and then became a Saturday morning cartoon and became toys — a lot of toys.
And I loved the toys. The toys themselves honestly had so much creativity put into them, and so many weird details and artistic elements. Something me and Jeff [Rowe] always talk about is how the Mondo Gecko toy — his tail had a roller skate tied to it, suggesting that [laughs] it was too heavy for him to drag around and so he, like, thought to put a roller skate on it to roll it around behind him. Little things like that were so imaginative, and they really have stuck in my head for 35 years.
And then the movies! I skateboarded because of the Ninja Turtles, and I did karate — it really tapped into a lot of things that were really popular in the ’80s, and ’90s as well. I felt like I was constantly the recipient of their goals; everything they were trying to do was really landing on me.
You’re quietly one of the biggest producers of indie comics adaptations in Hollywood. Preacher, The Boys, Invincible, and going back to The Green Hornet. How do you define your taste in comics? What kind of comic is the comic that grips you so hard that you go, Yeah, I think I want to make this my job for a year?
Well, first of all, it’s everything that is not Marvel and DC. [laughs] So that eliminates a lot right away. I grew up going to comic book shops, and it’s funny, video stores are making a slight comeback in some ways. This idea of browsing and not having things fed to you — as I think people feel we are now when it comes to entertainment — but instead entering the fair market of entertainment and just wandering around and seeing what catches your eye.
That’s what I always did with comic books; I would go to the comic book shop and I would just walk around. And you see this comic book and it catches your eye, and you see that comic book and it catches your eye. Those have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?
Like, I love Akira — what am I going to add to Akira? Things like that, where it’s out, and it’s good, it’s a movie and it exists. That’s something we think of also. For [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem], honestly [co-writer Evan Goldberg and I] felt like there was an unexplored facet, and as people who have written a lot of teenage films and have been cinematically linked to that genre a lot over the years, we were like, Oh, like, that’s totally different for this, is if we do a teenage version of it. A lot of it is just thinking, Could we bring this to life well and do it in a way that, as fans of it, we wouldn’t be annoyed with ourselves if we were watching it from the outside?
What has turned you off from Marvel and DC?
Honestly, probably fear. [laughs] We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.
It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with? And what’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this. So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!
Working on those bigger-budget, bigger-scope projects can be a real beast, and so can animated films. Are there specific lessons that you took from them for Mutant Mayhem?
I approach them very similarly. That’s something that I realized I used to think was a bug, and now I think it’s a feature. [laughs] A lot of people who make animated movies really approach them like animated movies, and they are constantly, from a writing standpoint, thinking of how to use the medium of animation, in the cutting pattern, in the scene patterns and all that. I’m firmly from the live-action world and so I very much write in the style of a live-action movie.
To me, I’m trying to bring what I would consider a traditional cinematic sensibility to the structure and the flow and how the scenes are, and not play too much into the medium in that way. And then to give the whole thing a look that is just, like, insane, was really a fun way to shade the whole thing.
It was unexpected to me, and I was honestly a little worried at what a big swing the look was at first. But the more I saw of it, I just started to get more and more excited about, and then started writing towards it, and thinking, OK, we have this crazy look. What do I want to see executed in this look? [laughs] What would be fun to watch?
Do you have comics on your bucket list for adaptation? Or, alternatively, what comics are you reading these days that you can’t put down?
That’s a good question. What have I been reading? I read old comics, from time to time. There’s these Green Lantern comics I’ve been reading, I love all those Grant Morrison Superman ones, I was rereading those because I heard that that’s what the James Gunn Superman movie was gonna be inspired by. I read them when they first came out, but I feel like I was distracted, so I went back.
Are there any that I wish we could make or adapt? Every once in a while? Yeah, those Grant Morrison ones are really appealing. We3 is something I’m a big fan of. It seems maybe just too sad honestly; it just bummed me out.
[Ed. note: We3 is a comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely about a trio of weaponized cyborg-animal hybrids. It’s infamous for its extreme violence and extreme pathos.]
We’ve kind of been down that road — and we know Grant a little bit, we’ve talked to him. That’s what’s nice, is we’ve done well with things that were traditionally considered unmakeable, essentially, for a long time. But also we don’t want to ruin things we love. So we’ll have very honest conversations with Grant and just talk about it and where his head’s at, and where our heads are at. Things like We3, we’ve talked to him about several times over the years. And we’re kind of always like, Yeah, I just don’t think this is the thing right now. There’s things like that — we really talk to the creators to make sure that we all think it’s a good idea, at that moment, in that way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODA4NjMxL3NldGgtcm9nZW4tdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy10aGUtYm95cy1pbnZpbmNpYmxlLWludGVydmlld9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzgwODYzMS9zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtdGhlLWJveXMtaW52aW5jaWJsZS1pbnRlcnZpZXc?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 03:16:49.588000+00:00,Ninja Turtles seem truly like teenagers in ‘Mutant Mayhem’,"More than ever, franchise’s new adventure gives itself over to the mindset of adolescence.","There are some good gags and clever innovations in the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” but there is one brilliant idea: casting Ice Cube as the voice of the movie’s mutant insect supervillain Super Fly.
It might have once been hard to foresee the value of having the MC who rapped of “dropping bombs on your moms” as the MVP of a PG-rated kids movie. But we’re now up to the seventh “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film, not counting all the series and videogames. That’s a lot of movies for a bit of IP that’s clung more firmly to lunch boxes than it has to pop culture. For the turtles, it was getting to be time to either, as Ice Cube would say, “chickity-check yo’ self” or try something new.
“Mutant Mayhem” can’t entirely get over the feeling of trodding over well-covered turtle ground. But if we must go once more into the ooze, the film by director Jeff Rowe (co-director of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and co-written by co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is probably the best of a not-so-stellar franchise. It’s certainly the one most invested with that “teenage” part of the turtles’ name. Plus, it’s got Ice Cube as a fly who quotes from the O’Jays.
‘‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’
Untitled Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Jeff Rowe and written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit. Running time: 99 minutes. Rated PG (for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material). Now showing at local theaters.
The animation is vividly textured, the beat is persistently hip-hop (Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and others pack the electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and the New York of the film is impressively detailed. But the most important twist to this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” iteration may be diving into the teenage-ness of its 15-year-old turtles.
If “Barbie” was balanced between Greta Gerwig’s childhood memories and her adult feminism, “Mutant Mayhem” gives itself over more fully to the mindset of adolescence. That’s in the gross-out humor and the comic book-like feel of the animation. But these are also recognizable teenagers who watch movies (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”), pine for concert tickets and make goofy phone videos of themselves slicing watermelons.
What Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) and Raphael (Brady Noon) really want is to fit in and go to high school like other teens. They have been relegated to the sewer ever since Splinter, a rat voiced by Jackie Chan, happened upon them after they were exposed as hatchlings to the same ooze that spawned Super Fly — who himself was the product of experiments by scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito, fated to dubious laboratories).
Splinter has much the same opinion of the majority of the rats in “Ratatouille”: Humans can’t be trusted. (Splinter’s particular fear is that they will “milk” him.) So the turtles have grown up undergroundwhile yearning for the wider world.
They find a hint of it with a high-school journalist named April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), who wants to document, and thus prove to humankind, their decency. At the same, the turtles meet the charismatic Super Fly and his band of mutants. At first, they’re fast-friends — “cousins,” Super Fly says — but the turtles then start hearing of Super Fly’s plans to turn all animals into mutants and eradicate the world of humans.
“Peoples, they got to go,” chimes one mutant.
Some of the thunder of “Mutant Mayhem” has been stolen by “Into the Spider-Verse” and this year’s “Across the Spider-Verse” — films that likewise upend the typical look of studio animation and do it with a pulsing soundtrack; but they did it more eclectically.
Yet this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” while a half shell of those films, has its own low-key charms. It’s goofier, grosser and mostly fun. The four turtles are never more than a hard-to-differentiate bale of overlapping dialogue of doubt and anxiety. But that first word in their name finally feels genuine. Seven films in, it’s only right that Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael should get a renaissance.

“I was like, ‘I’m going to do my best Eric Bana.’ This is an homage to Eric,” Byrne continues. “It was a group recording, and I’d never done that before for a voice job. Seth was there, and he had such high energy from beginning to end. There’s ‘Mayhem’ in the title, and it was like mayhem. Not in a bad way. It was fun mayhem.”
Byrne joked that her many collaborations with Rogen, which include the 2014 comedy “Neighbors” and Apple TV+’s “Platonic,” don’t have her husband, Bobby Cannavale, worried. “He’s our biggest cheerleader,” she says. “He totally gets it.

By the way, that’s for 2023 YTD alone, all built by Paramount.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem‘ Paramount Pictures / courtesy Everett Collection
As we told you, the launch of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reps a big win for the Brian Robbins-led Paramount Pictures Studios, as he builds out and breathes new lives into franchises.
Since 2012 and not including 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles global merchandise sales have amassed $8 billion, per industry sources. This was accomplished during Paramount’s ownership of the TMNT IP that they it acquired in 2009.
Paramount transitioned the Turtles business from predominantly collectors to mass retail, and natch, the latest reboot has catapulted demand from TMNT fans and partners alike. In the U.S. and Canada alone, industry projections think Mutant Mayhem, a co-production with Nickelodeon and Seth Rogen’s Point Grey, could exceed $110M.
Paramount Consumer Products’ Turtles theatrical program was its most ambitious yet, counting north of 400 licensees for the film and 1,100 total for the franchise.
Among those platinum licensees with Turtles merchandise tied to Mutant Mayhem were Playmates, Hasbro, Mattel, Crayola, Funko, Crocs, General Mills and more. Their products hit the global store shelves of Walmart, Target, Amazon, Macy’s, Kroger, Kohl’s, Primark, Smyths, The Entertainer, Soriana, Big W, Iden, Toys R Us, Mercado Libre and others.
In addition to action figures, the Mutant Mayhem product range also included Build-a-Bear.
In sum, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles products are available in more than 550 retailers, totaling 40,000 retail doors, in more than 220 markets worldwide.
Gaming integrations for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles included Minecraft, The Sims FreePlay, Fruit Ninja, Match Masters and more. Publishing partnerships included Random House, Bendon and IDW. There was a launch of TMNT: Battle Tycoon on Roblox from ParaG Game Division in partnership with Gamefam.
Paramount Global delivered over a half-billion impressions for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles across domestic CBS, adult networks and social. TMNT marathons aired across domestic Nick channels in addition there were marketing and activations across all foreign platforms. A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles YouTube channel was launched, and now counts 2.66M subscribers. Paramount’s PlutoTV showcased iterations of the TMNT 2012, 2019 and 1987 series.
Turtle Power at San Diego Comic-Con Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images
Eastman announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Paramount and Nick secured full rights to air the original cartoon series from the 1980s. Speaking of Comic-Con, Paramount was the only studio to have the guts to take a film down to Hall H and strut out footage for fans with director Jeff Rowe. Such a promotional opportunity was lost by rival motion picture studios, who shied away from the fanboy confab during the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes with a majority of talent unavailable to promote. Still, 135,000 attendees showed up at SDCC.
Meanwhile, the Paramount+ streaming service featured the full collection of TMNT with four series and eight movies in the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia, Latin America, Brazil, Italy and South Korea among others. There was more vertical integration power across the Viacom empire for Mutant Mayhem with the pic’s promotion at Nickelodeon resorts and attractions around the world in the U.S., UK and Italy.
Separately, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem counted a promotional partner campaign worth north of $100M in media value from myriad brand partners drawing 3 billion impressions, robust for an animated movie. And that’s without a big automobile advertiser. Earlier this summer, Disney/Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, a live-action title, counted a $118M promo partner campaign.
Among the notable brand partners for Mutant Mayhem were Pizza Hut. The team-up involved animators authentically integrating Pizza Hut into the movie. Pizza Hut also blasted off a 360-degree TMNT campaign by bringing back the fan favorite Big New Yorker pizza and supported that limited-time menu with activations across linear and digital platforms within the Paramount portfolio. There were four media spots including a 30-second custom animated spot. In addition, there were custom pizza boxes featuring an AR mobile gaming experience. There were also TMNT co-branded Pizza Vans that passed out pizza to fans at San Diego Comic-Con and other high-profile events across the country. Twenty-two international markets featured bespoke local spots, advertising, delivery stunts and limited-edition pizzas inspired by the movie, like the Mutagen Pizza in Australia.
The Xbox global campaign counted the first time-ever innovation of pizza-scented video game controllers with custom designs featuring each of the pic’s four heroes in a half-shell. Influencers led a campaign for a “retweet and win sweepstakes” that went viral across the web. In addition, Xbox executed a TMNT fan event at its NYC Microsoft flagship store on 5th Avenue on the pic’s opening day which included movie content via storefront billboards and a TMNT-themed gaming lounge with controllers on display. There was also a collaboration between TMNT and Pizza Hut for an apparel collection available at Primark.
Turtles eat bugs, hence P&G’s Zevo flying insect traps proved an ideal partner. It was the product’s first film partnership ever. The campaign featured a fully integrated 30-second spot that aired across linear and digital media platforms.
Among the local international highlights was Old El Paso’s “Ninja-Proof Tortilla Pockets” in the UK and France, which saw 1.2 million themed packs in 20,000 major supermarket locations and on Amazon.
Brazil’s Gol Airlines let fans “Fly In Mutant Time” onboard a fully customized Mutant Mayhem plane. The stunt was promoted in major airports, print and online.
Chargespot, the largest charging station brand in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan, called on teens and young adults to “Get Charged” at 27,000 customized charging stations.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem grossed $15.2M this past weekend at the domestic box office, repping a nice -45% ease for a 12-day running total of $72.3M. Through seven movies, the TMNT franchise has grossed over $1.2 billion at the worldwide box office.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1yZXRhaWwtc2FsZXMtMTIzNTUxOTIzMy_SAVZodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtcmV0YWlsLXNhbGVzLTEyMzU1MTkyMzMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

In April 1984, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's black-and-white comic book Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit the newsstands, introducing the world to New York City's favourite heroes in a half-shell. Leonardo, the group's de facto leader, heads the charge as he announces his and his brothers, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael, presence to the Purple Dragons, emphatically proclaiming, ""We're not wearing costumes.""In the nearly 40 years since, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have gone from comic book superheroes to action figures to TV and movie stars and around the world, kids have marked their allegiance with their favourite Turtle (for the record, mine is Michelangelo, for obvious reasons). For generations of children, TMNT dominated recess, Halloween and playtime from Canada to England to Japan, igniting our imaginations as we went into battle with Splinter, April and Casey.In recent years, the Turtles were given the live-action treatment — but in T eenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (in theatres now), our boys are back in animated form. Directed by Jeff Rowe and co-written by Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg , Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, Mutant Mayhem takes us back to the beginning with an all-star cast and killer soundtrack.But before we dive into the sewers for some pizza, here are five facts about the film that you might not know. Cowabunga, dude!Normally in animated films, the voice cast are brought to a sound booth separately to record their individual parts, with crafty editors stitching everything together in post-production. However, in 2019's The Lion King, Seth Rogen, who voiced Pumbaa, was able to actually record alongside Donald Glover and Billy Eichner, the film's Simba and Timon, respectively.Rogen's experience was so positive that he wanted to ensure that the voice actors in Mutant Mayhem were given the same opportunity, telling The Hollywood Reporter , ""We really went out of our way and bent over backwards on Ninja Turtles to try to capture that improvisational energy that you get when a lot of people are in the same place at the same time.""And the proof is in the pudding. Not only is the chemistry between the four Turtles — Nicolas Cantu (Leonardo), Micah Abbey (Donatello), Brady Noon (Raphael) and Shamon Brown Jr. (Michelangelo) — free-flowing and natural, seasoned comedians like Jackie Chan, Hannibal Buress, Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph, and of course, Rogen himself, are clearly relishing in the shared space.Given the name of the group, oddly, the past TMNT works have rarely explored the boys' teenage side. Rowe and Rogen — the latter of whom has a rich and successful resume creating teen comedies — wanted to position Mutant Mayhem as a high school movie, detailing the natural angst involved in growing up as outcasts in society with an over-protective parent.In developing the coming-of-age nature of Mutant Mayhem, Rowe was influenced by the classic films of the genre as well as more modern examples like The Edge of Seventeen and PEN15. ""We wanted it to be like Stand by Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" Rowe told Empire . Naturally, Rogen's Freaks and Geeks and Superbad, also stood in as sources of inspiration, particularly in the humour of Mutant Mayhem.As the first animated TMNT film since 2007, Rowe (who co-directed The Mitchells vs. The Machines ) had his work cut out for him, especially considering audience standards for animation are currently at an all-time high. To create the gorgeous and vivid animation in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen turned to the animation studios of Mikros and Cinesite.Mikros Animation, the animation house behind the PAW Patrol films, utilized hundreds of animators and VFX artists in their Montreal and Paris offices to create the incredible comic book-style artwork, that includes sketches that resemble high school notebook doodling. Cinesite's Vancouver team, a visual effects powerhouse that has worked on Game of Thrones and World War Z, were also tapped to develop the dynamic imagery of Mutant Mayhem that not only brings to life TMNT's comic book roots, but the '90s aesthetic as well.In addition to the electrifying score by Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross , Mutant Mayhem boasts an awesome soundtrack. ""It's a lot of songs that me and Jeff Rowe, the director, ourselves listen to,"" Rogen told ET Canada To reflect the New York City setting and '90s timeframe, Rogen and Rowe curated songs with a heavy '90s East Coast hip-hop and R&B influence, including Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"" and Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya."" The seemingly random assortment of songs on the soundtrack reflect the frenetic nature of a teenager-made mixtape, with the energy and spirit of youth found throughout.Just as important as the Turtles is their father, Splinter. Voiced by Jackie Chan in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen really leaned into the character's dad vibe, as well as the DIY nature of putting together a look living in a sewer.""Jeff Bridges's the Dude character from The Big Lebowski was a big fashion inspiration,"" Mutant Mayhem's lead character designer Woodrow White explained to Den of Geek . ""Splinter's build was [also] partially inspired by Danny DeVito, with his short stature and long arms.""Chan's contributions to the film even go beyond voicing Splinter. Studying Chan's fighting style in films like Police Story and Rumble in the Bronx, Rowe brought the splashy editing and comedic rhythm of those legendary fight sequences into Mutant Mayhem, resulting in some high-energy, action-packed moments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZXhjbGFpbS5jYS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNsYWltLmNhL2FtcGFydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

A bond like no other

,Vanilla Ice '90s hit 'Ninja Rap' is in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie with Seth Rogen,"After ”Ice Ice Baby,” '90s rapper Vanilla Ice had a hit that would also stand the test of time: ”Ninja Rap” for ”Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” in 1991","“Go, ninja, go, ninja, go!”
More than 30 years after his song made its debut, Vanilla Ice is having a moment. The world knows the ’90s rapper for his megahit ”Ice Ice Baby” — but another rap of his is generating some new engagement, thanks to the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" reboot by Seth Rogen.
""Ninja Rap"" was performed in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze"" live-action film in 1991 by Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Rob Van Winkle of Wellington, Florida. It's the sequel to the original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie that was released a year earlier.
""TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,"" executive-produced and co-written by Rogen, was trending this week. Here are things to know about Vanilla Ice and his ties to Florida and the ”Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.”
How popular is 'Ninja Rap' by Vanilla Ice?
Like Vanilla Ice on his social media platforms, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" fans are using the #goninjagoninjago hashtag. Some Instagram Reels are set to ”Ninja Rap.” The hashtag's been used on Twitter and TikTok. A check on Spotify two days before the Seth Rogen movie's release — Aug. 2 nationwide — show ""Ninja Rap"" has had more than 7.3 million streams, Vanilla Ice's fourth most popular Spotify. (For those wondering, Vanilla Ice's mega hit ""Ice Ice Baby"" took the Top 3 spots on his music profile in the music streaming service with a collective 371.4 million streams.)
Is Vanilla Ice in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie?
The '90s rapper had a cameo in the 1991 film ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze"" ... as a rapper performing on stage. Rogen said in news reports that he included Van Winkle‘s ”Ninja Rap” in the 2023 reboot's soundtrack along with other rap songs from East Coast artists.
After ”Ice Ice Baby,” this is another Vanilla Ice rap hit that would stand the test of time. To this day, the rapper continues to use ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" references, #goninjagoninjago and #NinjaRap on his platforms.
What is 'The Vanilla Ice Project?'
After his rap career, Vanilla Ice/Rob Van Winkle became a reality TV star on HGTV (home and gardening channel) and DIY Channel (do-it-yourself). For almost 10 years, he hosted ”The Vanilla Ice Project,” with several Florida homes remodeled or renovated.
In 2015, the reality TV star helped build a therapeutic pool for then 6-year-old Owen Johnson of Palm Bay, who was paralyzed in a car accident with his family at 2 years old, according to a USA TODAY story.
For two seasons, the home renovation star hosted ""Vanilla Ice Goes Amish” in 2013.
Outside of HGTV, the rapper competed on season 23 of ABC’s reality competition ”Dancing With the Stars” in 2016. His dance partner was Witney Carson. During his season, he famously formed a bromance with fellow dancetestant former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Spoiler alert: Vanilla Ice did not win the mirror ball trophy and was the 10th celebrity eliminated. Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez won that season.
Where does Vanilla Ice live in Florida?
In addition to his long rap career (he's touring with other '90s bands) and HGTV shows, Van Winkle is also known as a passionate Wellington resident, who is seen in and around Palm Beach County eating, stopping, collaborating and listening (get it? Lyrics from ""Ice Ice Baby"") . He lives in Wellington.
In August 2022, Van Winkle helped open a ""brewery slash museum"" in one of Lake Worth Beach's most historic buildings, according to a story in the Palm Beach Post. He helped restore a 100-year-old Masonic building about a block from City Hall into a four-level entertainment venue with a rooftop bar.
What is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles about?
""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is a popular franchise about four teenage turtles named after legendary artists from the Renaissance, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo — and their Sensei-slash-father Splinter the rat. Splinter raised the turtles from shell to teendom and taught them martial arts while living in the sewer. They befriend a TV reporter, April O'Neil, and nemeses in the series or movies often include Shredder, mutants Rock Steady and Bebop, and occasionally friend-foe Casey Jones, a hockey mask-wearing vigilante with martial arts skills of his own.
Over the years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" has been a cartoon series, an animated series, a trilogy of live-action films in the '90s, and a Michael Bay reboot in 2014 and 2016 starring Meghan Fox.
The 2023 reboot stars martial arts star Jackie Chan as Splinter, Shamon Brown Jr., Micah Abbey, Brady Noon and Nicolas Cantu. Rogen, Chan's co-star in the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies, and several other celebrities (John Cena, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Paul Rudd) have voice cameos in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.""

2023-08-01 16:09:01+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Beg BTS’ Jung Kook Not to Watch Them Sing ‘Butter’ in ‘Mutant Mayhem’ Teaser,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sing BTS' 'Butter' in a teaser for the upcoming 'Mutant Mayhem' animated movie reboot.,"It’s right there in the name: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So, given that said bony-shelled reptiles are right in the demo, it’s fitting that in a new promo for the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that is out on Wednesday (Aug. 2), Leo, Raph, Don and Mikey are unabashed members of the ARMY.
“This is it, guys,” Raphael laments in the 20-second clip in which the foursome are lashed to a giant bomb-like device that seems to spell their demise. “Oh, so many regrets,” he groans. “I just wish I could see BTS IRL,” says Donatello.
Leonardo, of course, has a creative idea, offering, “We could do some of the songs for you,” he says, with Michelangelo adding that he’d be down for a few bars. Leo then gets the gang started, singing the first lines of BTS’ global No. 1 smash “Butter,” while encouraging the others to join in. But, given their predicament — they are lashed to a wall by their wrists and ankles — the song comes out as more of a cry than a croon.
It’s all a bit sad, honestly and Don complains that they don’t even really know the words. To be fair, the tweet of the clip had a very stark warning message: “Jung Kook please don’t watch this.”
In addition to the four turtles (voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon), the film also features the voices of Rogen, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph; Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote and co-produced the film directed by Jeff Rowe.

,I Tried To Get My Kid Into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles And Learned That Nostalgia Is A Two-Way Street,Do kids care about our '90s nostalgia? One writer entered a 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' pop-up experience to see if kids today love the turtles as much kids of the '90s did.,"My five-year-old son knows worrisomely little about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. His knowledge of the heroes in a half-shell is a mixture of conjecture and second-hand information and I fret about the cultural touchstones of his childhood. He has seen a commercial or two and has friends who are into the Turtles, so he tells me he knows that they’re “turtles who are teenage and very good at fighting.” And eat pizza? “Oh yeah … They’re in love with pizza? I think.” He’s bluffing. The kid didn’t know about the pizza.
This information gap is understandable. To a rising first grader in 2023, there’s a glut of franchises to glom onto. There are Marvel kids, Minecraft kids, Pokemon kids, Rainbow Ranger kids, Ninjago kids, (still) Star Wars kids, and even the occasional TMNT kid; whose dads are apparently better hype-men. But also, for kids these days, brand loyalties are fickle. You can appreciate a bunch of worlds — and that’s ok. You don’t need to be all in. Identities aren’t all that wrapped up in TV heroes or comic book brands.
To this rising first grader in the 80s (not going to let you do that math), this is jarring. After 1988, to me, there were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans — and everyone else. And what’s not to love? Martial arts! Check. Mutants! Check. Old school weapons Mom will let me fawn over! Yup. Bad guys with throwing stars and the ability to ooze into city-crushing giants! Check. Pizza! Pizza!
So obviously I want to get my kid into TMNT — to introduce him to a franchise with at least one movie coming out soon (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, out August 2) and maybe get into the OG animated series that aired from 1987 to 1996 that Nickelodeon confirmed at Comic-Con it has secured the rights to. But I’m not entirely sure how to even start.
He’s not a huge TV watcher, but he gets enough screen time that just showing him a show isn’t going to guarantee he’ll be into it — or even want to watch more than one. The glut of options has led to a discerning viewer. He may decide the Turtles are too weird — or, worse, not weird enough. That they’re too violent and scary — or just the opposite, silly and unseriousness. It’s hard to tell where he’ll go with it. He could reject it so quickly and casually because he is a kid in a candy store, entertainment-wise. This is the paradox of all the choices our kids have now with streaming: It’s tough to be a dad today looking for a cartoon bonding opportunity. When we were kids, we got into shows and movies, and books because those things were simply there.
But, out of the ooze, an opportunity arose. In Los Angeles and New York City, the city I call home, a TMNT pop-up came to town, marketing the coming Mutant Mayhem movie and giving kids and adults an experience that is custom-built to get their butts in seats. Or so I hoped. Honestly, movie marketing pop-ups like this can be a hit-and-miss kind of thing. You might expect Hollywood Studios, but usually, you get Chuck E. Cheese. Knowing this, I tempered expectations a bit, took him out of summer camp early, and we headed on a northbound train.
Is this the making of a fan? At the least, it’s paving the way for some good bonding.
We talked Turtles on the way and I found he was skittish about the coming movie. Perhaps he was feeling around to see if there were other options. Maybe he knew enough to know that the bad guys can be pretty bad when there are mutant animals involved. “Well, it’s one of the better movies for the two of us to see together in the theaters next month,” I truthfully told. He seemed open to the idea.
So I escorted him to the “sewers” located in the Meatpacking Districts of Manhattan and guided him into the smoke machine-filled hallways that were supposed to represent the home of the four heroes in half shells. He got all wide-eyed and quiet — in that way a 5-year-old does when testing their bravery. He walked past the pipes and through hanging wires, tons of ‘90s detritus he didn’t notice — unspooled cassette tapes, old TVs playing the 1989 side-scrolling TMNT NES game; catnip for this grown kid — when Donatello’s cartoon aperture dove down, projected on a wall. I could see my son jump, then relax. Ah, good guys, his body language said and he moved through these sewers more confidently. I felt he had turned a corner on the whole franchise. He was in.
Remember when Pizza Hut was the most dominant marketing force in our lives? Long live physical media. INFO 1/2 { PREV NEXT }
All things told, there was some fun. Punching bags, a throwing star area, and more cartoon baddies but always in fast relief with the turtles. Like a ride at a theme park, it all went remarkably fast and before we knew it, we were at the end, or adventure over.
Did my kid think the Turtles were cool now? He was a little unconvinced, I could tell. It was fun, but confusing to someone who just doesn’t know why this nostalgia is well nostalgic. And as we’re looking to leave, I see the thing that had cemented it all for me: Turtle action figures. That’s it! That will hook him!
My mind dives back to my Donatello — my favorite, always — whose perfect plastic figurine would punch (or chop?) with a squeeze. This guy took a licking and was always a solid protagonist in my basement rec room. The toy that was my real memory, I’m now realizing as I stare at a cornucopia of colorful figures on skateboards, in the plush, riding in the pizza van. More than the show, the movies, the entirely weird world, and limited character arcs of these pizza-loving mutants, the toys were it to this once and future kid. My son looked upon them fondly. Skateboards, pizza mobile, cool outfits, movement, and soft weapons. The toys were solid. Finally, there was a whole fun thing here we both understood.
We left and silently walked up the street to, of course, a pizza joint I had picked out ahead of time. Over a ginger ale and a slice, I asked, “So what do you think?” He took a bite, pondering (or half listening) to my question. “When’s the movie again?” he asked. “Next weekend we can go,” I say. “Cool. Do they have the toys there?” “We’ll see.”

2023-07-07 13:00:00+00:00,TMNT director teases that Shredder will appear in future movies,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem co-director Jeff Rowe says he'd be ""100%"" down to make a sequel in new SFX interview","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character Shredder might not be in Mutant Mayhem but he'll definitely show up in future movies, says co-director Jeff Rowe. If the new animation spawns a franchise, that is...
""We'll Dark Knight it,"" Rowe jokes to SFX magazine in the new issue, which features Good Omens season 2 on the cover, before adding that he'd ""100%"" love to develop a sequel. ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""
In TMNT lore, Shredder is the archenemy of the titular Turtles' mentor Splinter, who is voiced in the new film by Jackie Chan. Various iterations of the character, who is most often known as Oroku Saki, have have been depicted over time, including human and non-human, as well as both male and female.
As you might expect, Mutant Mayhem centers on righteous reptilians Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, as they set out to win the hearts of their fellow New Yorkers, after years of being sheltered from the human world. Alongside their new friend, April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the anthropomorphic foursome attempt to take down a mysterious crime syndicate, but find themselves in over their shells when they become the target of an army of mutants.
Seth Rogen, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, John Cena, and Paul Rudd are among the star-studded voice cast. It releases on August 4.

Referencing how the Turtles are very rarely adolescents whenever a new version of the 1980s cartoon rolls around, Rowe, who helmed the movie with Kyler Spears, told SFX: ""We wanted a teenager to watch the movie and feel seen by it and understood.
""That was our cornerstone for everything, like making the Turtles not hulking, ripped versions of themselves, but lanky and awkward. That carried through into casting actual teenagers. It's insane that it had never been done before."" Here, the eponymous quartet are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr.

2023-07-20 14:00:00+00:00,How Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Puts a Fresh Spin on the Franchise,"Actual teenagers and a fresh, wild art style mark a new era for the classic franchise in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","This appreciation dripped into the team’s approach to Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen says the filmmakers strove to keep what was drafted in the concept art. “I’ve been through this process so many times where you see the concept art and by the time you’re making the movie, it has lost all of its energy. That did not happen here,” he reveals. “It was asymmetrical and imperfect. I remember the first time seeing it dimensionalized, and it blew my mind.”
The Turtles in the Room
The story and style of Mutant Mayhem boast teenage vigor, but to hear adults voicing the core team would betray all that the filmmakers envisioned. So it was critical that, for the first time ever, the Ninja Turtles are played by actual teenagers. “Part of the spirit we were trying to capture was to make the movie fun, like kids playing with toys,” says Rogen, revealing that even his adult co-stars had fun playing off each other IRL. “That was something we talked about. How do we make it feel fun and silly? This reckless weirdness that almost every kid playing with their toys has?”
Actors Nicolas Cantu (The Walking Dead: World Beyond), Brady Noon (Good Boys), Shamon Brown Jr. (The Chi), and Micah Abbey (Grey’s Anatomy) voice Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, respectively. In an unusual turn for any major animation project, Mutant Mayhem recorded the cast in-person, together, allowing them to improvise lines. The goal was to capture the authenticity of teens hanging out—something that no adult screenwriter can replicate in Final Draft.
Casting was “arduous,” according to Rogen. Citing his own experiences in voiceover work, Rogen strove to mitigate factors that can sometimes leave animation projects feeling inauthentic. “A recurring frustration I have is that you never perform with the other actors,” he says. “The magic of our work that people like is a result of being in the moment and playing off each other. That energy was important to capture. So we went through painstaking lengths to make sure that as much as possible, they all recorded together.”
Fittingly, this approach to recording enabled the filmmakers to see their adolescent stars slowly become their characters—and vice versa. “They’re very much [acting like] themselves,” Rowe says. “So much of the dialogue is just things they said to each other.
I cannot think of another animated film at this scale that’s worked that way, in casting kids and letting them be their authentic selves. We wanted these characters to be complex and feel like people you knew.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1uZXctc3Bpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Seth Rogen is among the creatives showing off the unique animation style for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle: Mutant Mayhem, which Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies will open on Aug. 4.
“The bigger swing these animated movies are taking, the more excited people seem to be like that,” says Rogen in a new featurette.
In the story, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
“They had to feel like real teenagers,” says writer/director Jeff Rowe of the pizza-loving Turtles, which extended to creating a visual style as if it were animated by teens.
“What we wanted to do was create an incredibly fun and engaging version of the Ninja Turtles,” says Rogen, a producer, writer and the voice of Bebop.
Ice Cube, who voices Superfly adds that “the animation and flavor of the movie was so original and fresh.”
The voice cast also includes Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown, Jr., Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Nicolas Cantu, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Brady Noon, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tYW5pbWF0aW9uLTEyMzU1MzQ4NjEv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1hbmltYXRpb24tMTIzNTUzNDg2MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-06 21:04:24+00:00,Long Range Box Office Forecast: NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM and MEG 2 Early Prospects; BARBIE Tracking Soars,"With summer movies currently in full swing, this week's update welcomes the addition of August's first major releases in a peak at the final month of the season: The Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","Images courtesy Paramount; Warner Bros.
With the summer movie season currently in full swing, this week’s update brings us through to August with the releases of Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
In addition, this week’s long range forecast offers a significant update on Warner Bros.’ Barbie, listed in the table below. Pre-sales for the highly anticipated adaptation continue to impress, leading The Little Mermaid by a significant margin and comparing favorably to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 at the same point prior to release. Barbie’s head-to-head box office opening with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer continues to drive intense social media engagement for both films.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount Pictures
August 2, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $27M-$36M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $37M-$49M
Domestic Total Range: $101M-$145M
PROS:
The Turtles brand has been successfully reinvented and reintroduced to modern youngsters a few times since its inception in the 1980s, most recently with the 2014 and 2016 live action box office hits. Nostalgia is also a factor here, as older fans are a key driver of interest in this new entry.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, with their production studio Point Grey Pictures, have a solid track record of box office success in recent years, with Good Boys, Sausage Party, and other films. The expectation here is that the creative team will execute a blend of modern and classic sensibilities with an eye towards ensuring the franchise’s endurance.
The absence of any other late summer animated options—or, for that matter, films catering to young males—puts this film in a strong position during the dog days of the season before school starts again. The use of an edgier animation style that embraces 2D and 3D to produce a comic book aesthetic, comparable to Sony’s Spider-Verse films, could further help Mutant Mayhem stand out with fans and young audiences.
CONS:
As seen with last summer’s DC League of Super-Pets, not all animated wide releases based on IP succeed at the box office. Turtles will need to stand out beyond its fan base and generate positive word of mouth to live up to its potential, especially in the wake of several aging franchises underperforming so far this summer.
Premium screen space could still be hard to come by, with other summer releases—like Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning—hoping to regain some of those auditoriums in their chase weeks.
If Disney’s Haunted Mansion breaks out, Turtles could have more competition than it hoped for.
Meg 2: The Trench
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 4, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $26M-$35M
Domestic Total Range: $70M-$105M
PROS:
The first Meg was a sleeper box office hit, opening to $45.4 million and legging out to $145.5 million domestically five summers ago.
The return of Jason Statham should assure the return of both his own fans and those who enjoyed the original.
Meg 2, like its predecessor, is well-positioned in the final weeks of summer movie season. An expected premium screen presence should also give it a boost.
CONS:
Competition could be notable this time around with the aforementioned appeal of Turtles to male audiences of varying ages, plus the potential staying power of other July releases. Titles such as Gran Turismo, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, Blue Beetle, and Strays will aim to get some of Meg 2‘s male moviegoers throughout August.
Historically, and particularly in recent memory, action sequels such as Meg 2 have not always lived up to their predecessors’ box office performances.

The film enjoyed generous preview screenings ahead of its opening Wednesday and has earned an eye-popping $247.5 million already.
Meg 2: The Trench, the giant shark action sequel co-produced by Warner Bros. and China’s CMC Pictures, slipped to third place in its second weekend with $16.7 for the frame and $91 million overall. Chinese fantasy blockbuster Creation of the Gods 1: Kingdom of Storms climbed back into second place, taking in $26.8 million for a hefty $283.4 million four-weekend total, according to data from Artisan Gateway.
Paramount Pictures’ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, meanwhile, bombed with a three-day start of just under $1 million — despite the presence of Chinese action icon Jackie Chan in the starring voice cast. The flop continues a trend of Hollywood titles struggling to break through at China’s box office. Local ticketing service Maoyan projects Ninja Turtles to top out in China with just $1.5 million.
No More Bets is executive produced by Chinese hitmaker Ning Hao (Crazy Alien) and directed by relative newcomer Shen Ao. The film follows a computer programmer (Lay Zhang) and a model (Gina Jin) who are enticed abroad by the promise of high-paying jobs but find themselves duped by a ruthless gang and forced to participate in online fraud. Ao has said that he researched hundreds of cases of a real-life cyber fraud cases involving Chinese citizens as part of his writing process. Maoyan forecasts that No More Bets will finish its run with over $500 million, which will make it China’s biggest hit of the summer.
Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which got a surprise box-office boost from cosmopolitan young Chinese women, has begun winding down in the market. It has earned $35.8 million to date, with Maoyan forecasting only slight gains to come.
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer will be the next high-profile U.S. title to hit China when it opens Aug. 30.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW5vLW1vcmUtYmV0cy1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWJvbWJzLTEyMzU1NjU5NDMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utbm8tbW9yZS1iZXRzLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtYm9tYnMtMTIzNTU2NTk0My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.
Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.
Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.
Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.
The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”
Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.
Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”
There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.
On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).
Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.
Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.
Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)
“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

,I worked on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from thousands of miles away,Artist Sean Sevestre has played a key role in the creation of the film despite being based in Edinburgh.,"I worked on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from thousands of miles away
By Angie Brown BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter

Sean Sevestre has played a key role in the creation of the new blockbuster film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - despite being thousands of miles away from his Hollywood colleagues.
The 29-year-old Scottish artist has worked on the visual development of the hit new movie for two years from his Edinburgh home.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which stars Seth Rogan, Jackie Chan and John Cena, was released earlier this month.
Sean worked as a concept artist on the movie. He would draw the ideas, then a 3D animator would makes a graphic model from his designs.
""So far this is the most impact I've had in a film,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""Hollywood is high paced and exciting and the people I worked with on this film reflected that.
""I felt extremely respected and trusted. There was always room for me to try stuff and to make mistakes and to work on things.
""When I watched the film I thought it looked amazing - there is nothing that has ever looked like this before.""
Paramount
Mutant Mayhem was released earlier this month
Sean spent a decade teaching himself how to draw and make films.
""I started a product design degree at university when I was 17 but after four weeks I quit because it became clear it wasn't going to teach me what I wanted to do,"" he explained.
""I then enrolled at art college on a painting degree but again I left after two weeks.
""I felt so strongly about it that I decided to teach myself. My mum gave me two years to see if I could make it work.""
From his bedroom in Penicuik, Midlothian, he began to teach himself techniques using the internet.
""My mum was fairly sceptical but she trusted me because I'm not an irrational person.
""I had a burning fire inside me. I was so serious about it that I taught myself relentlessly every day.
""I studied the anatomy of the body and how it moves and how light works.""
Paramount
Sean said there had been a lot to learn.
""I disappeared for three years and looking back it's a bit of a blur.
""I was obsessed in a good way. I pushed myself as hard as I could and gave up a lot of social stuff.""
When he was 20, Sean he felt he had reached a good base level and started posting some of his work on sites where Hollywood producers look for new talent.
It was then he was asked to work on the movie A Monster Calls, which starred Liam Neeson.
""I was so excited because it felt like a breakthrough
""All of a sudden my mum could see things were working for me.""
Sean said he learned from his entrepreneurial dad to have the confidence to teach himself.

Sean taught himself to do competitive tricking
He said: ""My parents divorced when I was five and I would see my dad in the holidays. We would go snowboarding and I would say: 'I can't snowboard.' He would say: 'I taught myself so can you'.""
Sean learned classical guitar and taught myself to do competitive tricking, a form of acrobatics involving flips and twists.
""I got good at tricking and this gave me the confidence to know that I could teach myself anything I put my mind to.""
He was then commissioned to work on pop superstar Lil Nas X's Starwalkin' video and directed his own feature-length documentary, Perfect Storm.
Now he has built a studio in his Portobello home in Edinburgh.
""Now I actually have to turn down work that comes in which is an incredible place to be,"" he said.
""Growing up in a small town in Scotland I never thought I'd end up working in Hollywood.
""But thanks to the internet I was able to make a name for myself in the industry even though I felt far away from that world.""
Sean Sevestre

Sean got a B in Higher art at Beeslack High School in Midlothian.
He added: ""I wasn't the art guy, nobody expected this.
""I've not got this crazy talent. What I do is a result of extreme deliberate practice that has taken me from being average to someone now with a reputation.
""Anyone who wants it badly enough can do it. It's dedicated time and practice and hard work continually sitting at the edge of your ability that gets you there.""
So what's next for Sean?
""I'm working on something exciting just now, but I can't talk about it.
""I'm still pushing myself and looking to achieve more.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1zY290bGFuZC1lZGluYnVyZ2gtZWFzdC1maWZlLTY2NTMzMDM20gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLXNjb3RsYW5kLWVkaW5idXJnaC1lYXN0LWZpZmUtNjY1MzMwMzYuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-10 15:25:00.571000+00:00,Seth Rogen Loves TMNT So Much He Busted His Head Open With Nunchucks,Rogen says wanted to be Mikey so bad he immediately cracked his head and a childhood lamp showing off his ninja skills,"During a press junket interview for the upcoming animated film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, actor and co-writer Seth Rogen revealed that he’s been enamored with the heroes in a half shell for so long that he’s got the battle scars to prove it. More precisely, Rogen cracked his dome open playing with nunchucks like Michelangelo, as many of us have.
TMNT: Mutant Mayhem follows younger versions of the turtle quartet as they try to gain popularity among their fellow New Yorkers by putting a stop to the villainous Superfly’s crime wave. The animated film includes a star-studded cast of Hollywood actors in supporting roles including Rogen as Bebop, Ice Cube as Superfly, John Cena as Rocksteady, and action-movie legend Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, to name a few.

Speaking with Empire Magazine, Rogen revealed that his fanboy-related TMNT injury came soon after his father gifted him his pair of nunchucks.

“Part of the reason I did karate was because of the Ninja Turtles,” Rogen said. “Me and [co-writer Evan Goldberg] both did karate together. My dad got me nunchucks that I cracked my head open with, because I was obsessed with the Ninja Turtles, and Michelangelo specifically.”

Goldberg added to Rogen’s painful recountings of his ninja faux pas, divulging that it was more than Rogen’s head that the comedy actor broke when displaying his nunchuck skills, saying “Seth had just got these nunchucks. He was like, ‘Yo, check this out, I want to show you this awesome move,’ and just immediately shattered a huge chandelier from his parents’ house into a billion pieces. It took us, like, five hours to clean. On a sitcom, you’d be like, ‘This is too broad.’”
“It was instantaneous,” Rogen added. “It was as though what I was trying to show him was my ability to destroy a lamp.”

In retrospect, it’s probably best that Rogen fancied Mikey instead of Leonardo or Raphael. One could only imagine the kind of physical and property damage a kid could do if left unattended in a house with twin katana or two sais.

Director Jeff Rowe told Insider that he learned several Gen Z phrases while making the film.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" director Jeff Rowe said that he learned lots of new phrases from the movie's Gen Z cast members.
Rowe and producer Seth Rogen cast teen actors, whose ages range between 15 and 19, to voice the titular turtles, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.
The cast — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Brady Noon, and Nicolas Cantu — recorded their lines together in the same booth in order to allow them to riff off each other.
In an interview with Insider, Rowe said that some of the conversations between the turtles in the movie were improvised by the actors.
""There's this very funny scene where the turtles are just talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. Like, 'Hey, we're gonna be like real New Yorkers. Get a bacon egg, and cheese sandwich.' And they're all like quoting different YouTube videos that they watch and they just go off for like a minute talking about that,"" Rowe said.

""We didn't script that. They just did that in between takes. I think they were just legitimately talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. And then they were like, 'Make sure you're rolling,'"" the director continued.

Rowe added: ""And then we just put that in the film. It's totally improvised and totally not planned. It's unwritable. I don't think you can write that.""
Rowe said that he and the producers had to check if the teens' conversations were appropriate for the PG-13 movie, especially when they used Gen Z slang.
""I learned what 'rizz' is,"" Rowe said. ""They would say stuff and then we'd be like, 'Cool. Just say it like that. Wait, is that offensive? Is that beyond PG-13? What? Okay. No? It's cool.'""
Rizz is short for charisma and is used in romantic situations when a person is able to effortlessly charm another person.

2023-07-31 14:00:15+00:00,August 2023 box office preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ kicks off last month of summer,"August is often referred to as the ""Dog Days of Summer,"" because at a certain point, the box office just dies.","August is often referred to as the “Dog Days of Summer,” and it’s not just because of the intense heat that is permeating the country, but also because at a certain point, the box office just dies, as people go on vacation and others prepare to return to school in September.
This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.
Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)
The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.
“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)
A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)
Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.
“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)
Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.
“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)
A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”
“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)
Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.
“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)
Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.
“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)
Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.
“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)
Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?
“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)
Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.
“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)
Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.

Time to get into some limited releases …
“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)
The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.
“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)
Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.
“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)
Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.
“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)

At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.
“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)

Now, the social media embargo has lifted for the first press showings of the version of the animated reboot that'll be hitting theatres this August.
The movie seems to have screened for a select few journalists at Paramount, and while we only have a few Tweets for now (other screenings still seem to be taking place), they are just as gushing. It seems fans of the Heroes in a Half-Shell are in for a treat.
Check out some Tweets below, and we'll update as more reactions are shared.
Brilliant decision to have the Turtles voiced by actual teenagers - it adds so much to the film tonally, but also the humor pops more.

2023-07-31 15:01:18+00:00,"'TMNT' Co-Creator Confirms Disappointing News for ""Last Ronin"" Fans - Inside the Magic","It might be a great week for 'TMNT' fans, but this is bad news.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will likely take theaters by storm over the next few weeks. This year has seen its fair share of blockbusters take a massive slice out of the box office, including Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023). However, it’s animated films that seem to be the dominant force of cinema in 2023.

Across the Spider-Verse (2023) caught $682.4 million on its web and became Sony Pictures Animation’s highest-grossing film, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.355 billion worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing animated films ever.

Needless to say, the CG-animated Mutant Mayhem stands a solid chance at success. The film is also being heavily marketed in a similar fashion to Barbie (minus all the many shades of pink, of course), which echoes “Turtle-Mania” from the early ’90s.

In fact, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures are so confident Mutant Mayhem will turn in a huge profit that they’ve already announced the film is the first installment in a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set to follow the movie on Paramount+ this year.

So it makes sense that Nickelodeon isn’t letting anything stand in the film’s way — not even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

It turns out Nickelodeon is king when it comes to the TMNT property, so much so that they appear to have already stopped another Ninja Turtles reboot from hitting the big screen, likely because it may interfere with the new Mutant Mayhem universe.

That reboot is “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020)…

What is “The Last Ronin”?

“The Last Ronin” is an ongoing comic book series from IDW Publishing, which has been churning out TMNT comic books since 2011. The series follows lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo as he embarks on a one-way revenge mission to take on the man responsible for the deaths of his three brothers in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City.

The series now also has a follow-up titled “Lost Years,” which details the preceding years in which Michelangelo embarks on a quest to become the Last Ronin while, in the present day, introducing four brand-new Ninja Turtles, Odyn, Yin, Moja, and Uno, who are under the tutelage of newly-appointed sensei, Casey Marie Jones.

At this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that “The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution” (2023) will arrive later this year.

Is “The Last Ronin” in a different universe?

“The Last Ronin” takes place in an alternate timeline now dubbed the “Ronin-verse.” However, it’s reasonable to consider that it follows on from the “present-day” IDW material, which is still ongoing.

The Ronin-verse is already expanding in the form of follow-ups such as “Lost Years,” the one-shot comic “Lost Day,” and the upcoming “Re-Evolution,” and also with many collectible action figures. There’s also a “Triple-A” video game in the works, although most fans would prefer a theatrical adaptation.

Will there be a “Last Ronin” movie?

Since it arrived in 2020, TMNT fans have been clamoring for a big-screen adaptation of “The Last Ronin.” In fact, fans have wanted a dark, gritty theatrical outing for well over three years. After all, this is the style and tone in which the Ninja Turtles first started in Mirage Comics, co-created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984.

Unfortunately, it looks like “The Last Ronin” won’t be getting the big screen treatment, or the small screen treatment for that matter — at least not anytime soon.

In an interview with ComicBook.com, Kevin Eastman discussed the fact fans have been hoping for a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” but explained that Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route instead.

“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While Nickelodeon could easily adopt DC’s “Elseworlds” strategy, which isolates films such as Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) from its shared universe installments, it looks like the universe established in Mutant Mayhem is their number one priority.

This may come as very disappointing news for fans of “The Last Ronin,” but there is a short, CG-animated, fan-made film on YouTube worth checking out. And then, of course, there’s the upcoming video game based on the ongoing comic book series.

When is “The Last Ronin” game out?

There’s currently no release date for “The Last Ronin” video game, though we do know it is inspired by the popular God of War video game series.

Earlier this year, Doug Rosen, Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said the game would focus only on Michelangelo. However, he added that Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, who only appear in the comics through hallucinations and flashbacks, may also appear in a playable format in flashback sequences.

Rosen also said that the mature themes of The Last Ronin (TBA) would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be.”

2023-08-05 15:28:37+00:00,"Movie review: ‘Mutant Mayhem’ a fresh, authentic take on the ninja turtles","The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.","Radioactive ooze generated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” has helped birth “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the new animated feature about everyone’s favorite rambunctious, pizza-loving reptiles. Directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears showcase the turtles in a way we’ve never seen them before, utilizing a blend of 3D and 2D animation to create a unique, rough-hewn (on purpose) style that suggests children’s book illustrations blended with teenage sketchbooks.

That edgy look is paired with a script that’s funny and fresh, a soundtrack filled with classic New York hip-hop, and a stunning industrial score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.

It’s clear that Rowe, Spears and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (who also produced the film), Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit and Brendan O’Brien, have a deep love and nostalgia for these lovable ‘80s relics, who were ubiquitous in the childhoods of older millennials. These sewer-dwelling rapscallions, raised and trained by a rat named Splinter, were born on the pages of a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. There were toys, a memorable Saturday morning cartoon, and three live-action movies back in the 1990s (who could forget the refrain sung by Vanilla Ice: “go ninja, go ninja, go!”). But the less said about the film adaptations in the 2010s, the better.

‘Mutant Mayhem’ is both a new direction for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a return to the past, symbolically, locating the material in the land of teenage imagination, memory, nostalgia and emotion. The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.

The color palette is dark with pops of neon, giving it an early ‘90s look. Sprinkled throughout are video clips that nod to the cultural touchstones of the creators: snippets of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” a salute to John Hughes, to whose vision of American high school the teen turtles cling, and instructional karate training videos, which is how Splinter (Jackie Chan) teaches his young turtle sons to defend themselves against the terrifying outside world.

The creators get back to basics with the story, focusing on the question of fathers and sons, mutants existing within humanity and the universal desire for acceptance. Splinter, a New York City street rat, is already inured to human rejection when he adopts the four adorable turtles covered in radioactive ooze. He raises them in a loving environment, away from the hustle and bustle (and malice) of the city, and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), grow up in a tight-knit quartet, though they long to be part of the world.

On the other hand is supervillain Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who doesn’t hide from humanity, but harbors genocidal impulses toward the people who have deemed his and his mutant brethren unacceptable. He wants to make every creature on earth a mutant, tipping the balance of power away from the humans and toward the mutants, believing it the only way they’ll find their place in the world.

With the help of intrepid reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the turtles decide to stop Superfly in the hopes that if they’re seen as heroes, they’ll be celebrated and integrated into society in order to fulfill their dream of going to high school (they’re teenagers, they’ve got teenage dreams).

The themes are broad and universal but the writing is remarkable — the dialogue feels natural and authentic to the age group, and it’s filled with modern slang and references to pop culture, rap songs, anime, comedy and more. Their desire for community is a resonant message, but it’s expressed in layered dialogue that feels like the way real teens talk to each other, and it’s beautifully performed by the four actors voicing the turtles.

The filmmakers manage to balance the contemporary feel of the writing and innovative visual style with their own nostalgia for childhood cultural touchstones, which makes “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a fascinating and highly entertaining blend of old and new.

2023-07-18 13:00:00+00:00,Toy Review: TMNT Mutant Mayhem Basic Turtles by Playmates,"The Mutant Mayhem basic Turtles give the kids a lot of bang for their buck, with a price point somehow still under ten dollars.","Playmates take a lot of heat from collectors.

Much of the ire stems from the fact that their action figures have remained essentially unchanged since the ’90s. They have the same levels of sculpt and articulation, and the same lack of internal scale. Example: Krang’s Robot Body can be anything from a deluxe giant to a turtle-sized figure.

But these criticisms miss the point. Playmates has managed to sell fully poseable, fully accessorized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures that a kid can buy for under $10 (plus tax, of course) since the ’80s. With the new Mutant Mayhem basic Turtles for the upcoming animated movie, they’ve done so and upped the sculpt and paint games. You might be lucky to find them for $10 still, but it’s not impossible.

Turtle Boyz II Men

For the new movie, the foursome come in all new sculpts. Each figure includes a baby turtle, signature weapons with colored handles (except Don’s staff; he makes up for that with an extra accessory of headphones), and a weapons rack with pop-out bonus weapons all in one color.

The single-color aspect is a little gross when we’re talking pizza slices. Then again, this is New York — maybe some gourmet place makes expensive metallic pizzas with edible silver and squid ink. Your imagination, your rules.

If you want the weapons to stay attached to the rack “unpopped,” take extra care to cuts the ties that hold it in the package. Pulling the rack out too abruptly may pull one of the weapons off.

That aside, they lie on the posts pretty well after being popped or cut off.

The gang do all include sheaths for their primary weapons. But in a slight change, Mikey’s are on his back. This is because he now has a fanny pack on his front, containing what seem to be a non-removable smartphone. (His glasses are removable, if you’re an older-school fan who hates that look.)

Turtles ‘N’ Timely

These Turtles draw on what came before. With Donnie now having glasses in many incarnations, that’s what this one has too. Likewise, Raph wear a bandana and be bulkier and more battle scarred than the rest, which also carries over. Mike looks a little goofy, as the party dude. Leo’s serious but calm, with head ties fluttering in the wind. To fit the aesthetic of them all being actual teenagers who look like teenagers, they’re thinner and not full adult-muscle size.

Packaging includes tiny file cards, containing factoids like Raph wanting to be an MMA fighter (Huh? Isn’t he one, unofficially?)

The articulation on these is an interesting mix. Cut joints at the wrists and ankles, true ball neck, disc-and-pin shoulders, knees, and hips. But the hips are unusual — normally, the disc joint would go side-to-side on the legs, but for these, they go back to front, allowing the gang to sit down and bend forward much more easily without going bow-legged.

The outlined eyes and teeth make for a nice cartoon-y look, and the sculpt feels a little rough, like a woodcut or unique animated style. These guys do look like they stepped out of a cartoon, which is the idea. And while they may be tougher to balance than some, you can achieve some contorted action poses with a bit of patience and finding the sweet spot.

Reptilian Scales

In case you’re wondering, they play reasonably well with the Loyal Subjects TMNT figures, scale-wise.

As far as 6-inch figures, it again depends how big you think the Turtles are, as they have varied a lot across many media.

Right as this review was about to publish, Playmates sent over a couple of the 12-inch Turtles to compare. Oddly, their leg disc-and-pin joints do go side-to-side. And they lack elbow joints completely. That aside, they’re similar, and have even more of a wood-carved feel. It keeps them visually distinct from previous toys. And at under $20, also a great deal, with sheathable primary weapons.

More detailed collectibles might add more of a wash, or even more hidden articulation, but these really are quite impressive for Playmates, with higher sculpt quality than usual and good articulation at the price. Anyone looking to casually pick up a set of the foursome could pay a lot more for NECA iterations, or get a fun, solid set for $40 and change.

The highly-stylized take on the Ninja Turtles represents the fourth swing at a theatrical franchise and the seventh installment to be released in movie theaters.

Inspired by movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a new generation of ambitious animated movies like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have started to seep into the blockbuster space, giving a cool, tactile update to properties that had previously been fairly by-the-numbers in terms of their style, even when the scripts themselves were strong.

""We wanted it to be like Stand By Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" director Jeff Rowe described. ""They've got a lot of that inauthentic confidence that teenagers have: when you're a teen, you don't know any better, so you operate with this hyped-up sense of, 'We can do anything!' That's something that [they] are great at – that Superbad thing where they're best friends, but they're kinda losers who make fun of each other, but you never doubt for a second that they truly love each other.""

According to the film's official synopsis, ""In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O'Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.""

However, unlike the 1991 arcade version, this one is miniaturised at ¼ scale of the classic arcade cabinet without sacrificing any features. It measures 17.5 inches (44.5 cm) tall and 9.2 inches wide (23.4 cm), with a depth of 9.4 inches (24 cm).

The Turtles in Time mini-arcade offers multiplayer options for up to four people, and the cabinet itself is crafted from real wood. The design and even button combinations mirror the 1991 arcade version.

In Turtles in Time, you can choose to control any of the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they travel through time to battle legendary enemies such as Krang and the Super Shredder. Each level features a boss drawn from either the 1987 cartoon or the 1991 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze.

You can place your pre-order now for both a standard ( ) or a signed collector's edition ( ), with free shipping options available for the UK if you spend more than £50.

2023-08-08 20:28:29+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’,The director Jeff Rowe narrates a sequence from his animated film.,"Hi, I’m Jeff Rowe. I’m the director of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.” Woo hoo! “This is going to be the Turtles’ first time encountering humans and the first time that we get to see them fight or be crime fighters in the way that the Ninja Turtles traditionally are. And we really wanted to make them not good at it.” I’ve never actually been a fight before, and I don’t know if you noticed, but all I’ve got is a big stick. How did I end up with a big stick? Maybe we diffuse this sitch with laughter. You’re not funny enough for that, dude. Enough talk! “We studied a lot of Jackie Chan movies, and something that’s really appealing is he always kind of starts at a disadvantage and then has to work his way up and fight through tons of people. And it was important to us to start the Turtles similarly and make it feel really grounded and real. So all of the action, all of the choreography here was designed to be tactile and real and not physics-defying and use objects that are just found within the scene and really see them struggle and get injured and take hits and fail, and then also see them be happy when they succeed. So the lighting and color in this scene and the very saturated colors and high contrast kind of was inspired by the street photography of Alex Webb. That Mikey back flip is maybe the most fantastical thing that happens in the fight. We wanted to define our own style, so we picked these like really bold colors, just like red light coming in through the windows. And then it left us with this problem where we’re like, How do we create visual progression throughout the sequence when the lighting stays that rigid? And then we’re like, okay, great, if something catches on fire, then we can fill the room with flame and then everything goes orange, and then they can put the flames out and it becomes a darker space and all of a sudden the car starts chasing them and we lean into the lighting of the headlights and our vendor partner Mikros found this really beautiful, gorgeous technique for rendering volumetric light where you see scribbles in it. All of the effects in here, all of the smoke is 2-D animation done on top of the 3-D. So it’s got that really scribbly, hand-drawn quality. We were looking at like Stan Brakhage films, like experimental animation, like scratching on the film negative to try and create something that was chaotic and not traditionally beautiful in the animated sense. And it’s just this tense, funny moment where the characters are trying to deal with a car that, if it hits them, will likely flatten them.” Woo-hoo! Yeah! We did it!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL3ZpZGVvL21vdmllcy8xMDAwMDAwMDkwMzE4NDgvdGVlbmFtZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1zY2VuZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-05 15:16:39+00:00,"Box Office: ‘TMNT,’ ‘Meg 2’ Racing Against ‘Oppenheimer’ for Second as ‘Barbie’ Reign Continues","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and ""Meg 2: The Trench"" openings look to take second from ""Oppenheimer,"" as ""Barbie"" stays on top.","The summer box office season may have reached the dog days of August, but it’s hardly looked stronger over the past few months. Though the openings of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Meg 2: The Trench” won’t be able to take down “Barbie” as the top performer in North America, both new releases are boosting theaters to a weekend with four different features grossing north of $25 million.

Paramount Pictures’ “Mutant Mayhem” added $9.3 million from 3,858 locations on Friday, tracking neck-and-neck with “Oppenheimer” for second place on domestic charts. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, opened with Tuesday evening preview screenings and is now tracking for a $42 million five-day debut — squarely within the projections of $35 million to $45 million heading into the weekend.

That’s not shabby for the “TMNT” entry, which cost only $70 million to produce — an especially economical figure for an animated studio release. Paramount has managed to capitalize on strong buzz as both an effective nostalgia play and a modern spin on the ’80s property. The 90% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes brought momentum into the weekend, and the glowing “A” grade through research firm Cinema Score shows early audiences are digging the latest adventures of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. As the summer season winds down, “Mutant Mayhem” should find some steady play.

The “TMNT” entry features a celebrity voice cast including Jackie Chan, Ayo Edebiri, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube and Seth Rogen, plus a group of young stars — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon — voicing the Turtle Brothers, emphasizing the first “T” of “TMNT.” Jeff Rowe directs.

Meanwhile, “Meg 2: The Trench” chowed down on $12 million from 3,503 theaters on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.2 million in Thursday previews. The hungry, hungry sequel from Warner Bros. is still tracking for an opening with a ceiling of $30 million. That’s a chunk behind the 2018 original, which saw Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against two gigantic sharks. “The Meg” earned $45 million in its domestic opening and finished with $145 million in North America and $530 million worldwide.

As its predecessor did, “The Trench,” which sees Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against even more gigantic sharks, will look to international territories as its main course to replenish a $129 million production budget. Notably, the sequel adds Wu Jing to its cast — a colossal star in China who has anchored local mega-hits such as “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” “Wolf Warrior” and “The Wandering Earth.” In fact, though Wu’s character perished in the first “Wandering Earth” entry, its follow-up was conceived as a prequel so that the actor could return to star.

Not that the first “Meg” was an awards season heavyweight, but “The Trench” hasn’t performed well in reviews (a 33% from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences also seem to be cooler on the sequel, turning in a “B” grade on Cinema Score, down from the “B+” earned by the first entry. Consensus opinion may be that the franchise has jumped the… well… but a spectacular reception would’ve marked a bit of a marketing misdirect, to put it frankly.

“Meg 2: The Trench” sees Statham and Wu team up with Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, Cliff Curtis and Sienna Guillory to take down not one, not two, but three prehistoric sharks, along with a bunch of other sea creatures. Beguilingly, the feature is based on a novel, “The Trench” by Steve Alten, and helmed by “Kill List” and “High-Rise” director Ben Wheatley, making the jump to big-budget filmmaking.

Neither sharks nor turtles can take down “Barbie” though, which added $17 million on Friday, down only 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. release has been a dominant force since scoring the biggest opening of the year and there aren’t really any signs of stopping. The hot-pink comedy will likely surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales within the next day or two.

Still the hottest ticket in the nation, “Barbie” should surge beyond a $450 million domestic gross through Sunday, placing it hot on the heels of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) to become the highest-earning North American release of the year.

It’ll be a close call for “Oppenheimer,” which may finally need to surrender second place on domestic charts to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” or “Meg 2: The Trench.” Then again, it may not. The Christopher Nolan feature is projecting $28.7 million for the weekend, which would be down an impressively slim 39% from its previous outing.

The sweeping biopic has surpassed $200 million in North America and looks to keep playing through August, already having extended its tenure in Imax auditoriums. It’s a formidable performance for such a grim chatterbox of a film, which ranks among Nolan’s top four domestic grossers ever after just two weeks of release.

The floor is collapsing under Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which earned $2.6 million on its second Friday, down a staggering 73% from its debut. The family-friendly funhouse feature should push beyond a $40 million domestic gross on Saturday — not exactly the desired return for a film with a $150 million production budget. With plenty of competition for audiences’ attention, “Haunted Mansion” may be off to an early grave.

Notably, the unlikely summer hit “Sound of Freedom” continues to perform well in its sixth weekend of release. Competitors project the feature about child sex trafficking will drop only 39% this weekend, boosting its domestic haul to $164 million — enough to surpass “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” ($156 million) to become one of the top 10 highest-grossing North American releases of the year.

The Angel Studios release has drawn a substantial amount of skepticism among box office watchers. After the credits roll on the thriller, star Jim Caviezel appears on screen to speak directly to audiences, saying that he believes “we can make ‘Sound of Freedom’ the ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of 21st-century slavery” and presenting a QR code that directs viewers to the distributor’s unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing users to donate money to Angel Studios so that it may purchase tickets for its own film and distribute them to those that request free admission. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.

It’s unclear to what degree the program has buoyed the box office fortunes of “Sound of Freedom,” but religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind the feature and a superlative “A+” grade on Cinema Score indicates that its audience is certainly enthusiastic about it. And regardless, those “Pay It Forward” ticket sales are still putting money in the pocket of exhibitors — whether people show up or not.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 19:43:26.676000+00:00,Naoki Yoshida Is Wearing a TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Shirt and Final Fantasy 14 Fans Want to Know Why,"While Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida may just be a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the TMNT: Mutant Mayhem shirt he was wearing during the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest keynote has led fans to believe he is teasing something more.","While Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida may just be a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the TMNT: Mutant Mayhem shirt he was wearing during the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest keynote has led fans to believe he is teasing something more.

Much like Xbox boss Phil Spencer does, Yoshida (who is affectionately known as Yoshi-P) actually has a history of wearing shirts to tease upcoming content in Final Fantasy XIV. For example, he wore a Batman shirt before the Dark Knight class was revealed and a Bugs Bunny shirt before the Viera race was announced.

This latest tease has obviously caused fans to start guessing what it all means, especially after Yoshi-P revealed Final Fantasy 14's fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, and said two DPS jobs would be arriving alongside it. While Yoshi-P wasn't ready to share what these new jobs were or if they were related to the turtles, he did unveil it as he was talking about them.

Yoshi-P and His TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Shirt

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?

So, if the shirt is a tease of a new class or two, what could they be? Final Fantasy 14 already has a Ninja class, a Samurai class, and a Monk class that uses Kung-Fu, so could there be an upcoming DPS class with a staff like Donatello? Could this actually also be a tease for a turtle race like the Kojin? Or could it be some kind of weapon swapper class where you will be able to switch between multiple weapons that may or may not be related to the turtle's iconic weapons?

Speaking of the Ninja, some think the team may add a new scouting class because the Ninja is the only one, and that class could possibly specialize in nunchaku or sais like Michelangelo or Raphael, respectively. Lastly, is there a chance it could be a word play like when Yoshi-P wore a Spider-Man shirt to announce the Samurai class, which sounds a lot like director Sam Raimi? There really are so many possibilities.

Either way, we have some time to wait until we get to play these new classes as Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail won't be released until Summer 2024. As for what Dawntrail is, it is meant to be the ""very best summer vacation a hero could possible have"" and will signify the first step into a ""new story"" for the game after the events of Endwalker.

In addition to all this news, Yoshi-P welcomed Phil Spencer himself on stage to help announce that Final Fantasy 14 would finally be cooming to Xbox consoles in the future.

2023-08-13 12:09:46+00:00,'Mutant Mayhem' Actor Open to Returning in 'The Last Ronin' Movie - Inside the Magic,The 'Mutant Mayhem' actor is open to reprising his role in 'The Last Ronin' movie.,"This Mutant Mayhem actor wants to return for The Last Ronin movie.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is the latest iteration of TMNT in film. But unlike previous entries, this time all the focus is on the teenage aspects of the Ninja Turtles, while the film is easily the most family-friendly of all seven.

So, fans hoping for a dark and gritty take on the half-shell heroes, particularly those who are familiar with the ongoing comic book series, “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) from IDW Publishing, may walk away understandably disappointed.

While Mutant Mayhem is heavily marketed towards younger audiences, none of the films, or the numerous television shows, are geared towards adults, save for the original film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). But even that is quite cheesy in retrospect.

A genuinely adult-themed Ninja Turtles reboot, whether it’s on the big screen or the small screen, would definitely need to take a page out of the comic books, whether it’s the original run from Mirage Studios in the ’80s, or “The Last Ronin”.

“The Last Ronin” takes place in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City, where an older Michelangelo embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter.

A second series titled “Lost Years” (2023) is currently available, and it was announced at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con that a third series titled “Re-Evolution” is in the works, with the first issue available from December. The Last Ronin game is also now in development.

Recently, in an interview with ComicBook.com, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman commented on the possibility of a movie adaptation of “The Last Ronin”, while also sharing some details about The Last Ronin game.

Here are his full comments:

“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take ‘The Last Ronin’ concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While The Last Ronin game sounds really exciting, unsurprisingly, when it comes to the big screen, Nickelodeon is clearly more focused on building a Mutant Mayhem shared universe. Not only has a sequel already been greenlit, a 2D animated follow-up series will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.

This isn’t great news for fans hoping for a live-action adaptation of The Last Ronin. Fortunately, The Last Ronin game will remedy some of that disappointment when it’s eventually released.

Either way, the popular comic book series is on the tip of everyone’s tongue, even when it comes to conversations about Mutant Mayhem. In an interview with YouTube channel Nerd Reactor, the brand-new Ninja Turtles actors were asked for their thoughts on “The Last Ronin.” Leonardo actor, Nicolas Cantu, who is clearly a fan of the comic books, was the first to respond, saying, “That is sick! That is sick!”

Brady Noon, who voices Raphael in the film, said to the interviewer, “You are the first person who has mentioned ‘The Last Ronin’!” before asking his co-stars, “Did you see the YouTube thing for it?”, referring to the popular fan film that imagines what a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” might look like.

The interviewer then put a question to Shamon Brown Jr. who voices Michelangelo, saying, “Let’s say, in the future, people love this [Mutant Mayhem], the reception is well, and people are like, ‘Oh man I want to see older Mikey deal with [the death of his brothers!'”

Here’s what the actor said in response: “I would be open to that, for sure. You know the voice gets deeper a little bit and, you know, has to get a bit more gruesome, but it’s going to be amazing. Hey, we’ll see. It could be five to ten years from now, you never know.”

“Are you going to miss us?” Cantu jokingly asked his co-star. “Cuz we’re gone in that storyline!”

While Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael are indeed dead at the time “The Last Ronin” takes place, they still appear in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, so there would certainly be room for Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey (Donatello) to appear alongside Shamon Brown Jr. They’d just need to be considerably older first.

Check out the interview below:

Even if The Last Ronin movie does eventually happen, it’s unlikely any of the Mutant Mayhem actors will ever end up reprising their roles, as Nickelodeon would likely want to keep the film as far from the Mutant Mayhem universe as possible. But who knows. One day, we could get a CG-animated Last Ronin movie as part of the “Mutant Mayhem-verse.”

Either way, who else could take on the role?

Who could play Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie?

Keanu Reeves

Keanu Reeves is no stranger to the martial arts, or taking down hordes of bad guys in neon-lit city settings as he sets out to exact vengeance upon a powerful enemy. If you’ve seen the John Wick films, you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Reeves’ gruff and somber voice would also be perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie.

Michael Shannon

Michael Shannon plays General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) and The Flash (2023), so he has plenty of experience with movies based on comic books. But it’s his role as Mr. Green in the comedy film The Night Before (2015) that oozes those “chilled out” Michelangelo vibes. More importantly, Shannon would bring a ton of grit to the role in The Last Ronin movie.

Chris Hemsworth

Chris Hemsworth also has experience with comic book movies as the God of Thunder, Thor, but we’re looking at his role as Tyler Rake in the Extraction films. Hemsworth also has the physique perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, and he’s also a great comedy actor, which would allow for the more “traditional” Mikey to surface from time to time.

Andy Serkis

Andy Serkis might not be the first actor you think of when casting a character like Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, or any Turtle for that matter. However, Serkis is the king of motion-capture performance, whether it’s Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, King Kong in Peter Jackson’s 2005 epic, or Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy.

Iko Uwais

Iko Uwais is hardly a household name in these parts of the world, but he might just be the most suited candidate for playing Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie. Uwais is best known for playing Rama in The Raid films, the adrenalin-charged Indonesian actioners. The actor’s mind-blowing fighting skills could prove an absolute game-changer .

Noel Fisher

There’s probably no better actor to play Michelangelo than, well, Michelangelo. It would seem unfair to give the character the motion-capture treatment again without considering Noel Fisher, who portrayed him in the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. The Last Ronin version of Mikey, however, would be very different to what you saw in those films.

These actors could even portray Michelangelo in The Last Ronin game, whether it’s through motion-capture performance or voice work. Unless Mutant Mayhem‘s Shamon Brown Jr. is confident about doing that deeper voice.

While there’s no film based on “The Last Ronin” in development, a trailer for The Last Ronin video game was released on Friday. Check it out below:

There’s no release date for The Last Ronin game. “The Last Ronin” comic books are all on sale now. The third series, “Re-Evolution”, goes on sale in December.

Mutant Mayhem is in theaters now. Check out the trailer below:

2023-07-03 12:00:51+00:00,New 'TMNT' Installment Finally Replaces Original Four Heroes - Inside the Magic,The new 'TMNT' installment isn't all that interested in the original half-shell heroes...,"The latest TMNT installment has just been released, and it’s finally broken new ground for the franchise.

“TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) made waves when it first arrived back in 2020, becoming a critical and financial hit, storming to the top of The New York Times best-sellers list, and transforming the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise forever.

The story finds the lone surviving Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo, embarking on a one-way mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter, in a futuristic and dystopian New York City.

Related: “Footage” Surfaces For R-Rated ‘TMNT’ Reboot, Marvel Star Was Set For Lead Role

Now, fans are poring over the second, five-part series “The Lost Years” (2023), the prequel/sequel to “The Last Ronin”, which expands upon “the lost years” that precede Michelangelo’s long-awaited return to New York, while also introducing the Turtles’ “replacements.”

The end of the first series sees Michelangelo successfully avenge the deaths of his three brothers after a bloody battle against New York City dictator Oroku Hiroto (The Shredder’s grandson). However, he is also fatally wounded in the fight.

But the final scene reveals that April O’Neil’s daughter, Casey Marie, a pivotal figure in the rebellion against Oroku Hiroto, has started to raise four baby mutant turtles in the original Ninja Turtles’ sewer lair, and this is where “The Lost Years” picks up.

It would be a lie to say that the current series is split halfway down the middle where its prequel/sequel commitments are concerned. Any focus on the four new turtles, Odyn, Moja, Yi, and Uno, is limited to only a handful of panels in each issue.

Related: Will the Live-Action ‘Ninja Turtles’ Reboot Be All-Female?!

But this isn’t a criticism — undoubtedly, the creators are drip-feeding these new characters into our lives without shifting the focus from Michelangelo entirely. The last original Ninja Turtle will most likely be gone forever once this series ends.

Each issue leaps forward three years, so by the time we arrive at Issue #4, the new turtles are, as the story describes, “pre-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But unlike the previous three issues, they’re now finally being trained on how to fight by their sensei, Casey Marie.

While their scene in the latest TMNT installment is just as fleeting as those in previous issues, it’s great to finally see them in action, even if the fight does turn out to be nothing more than a simulation, with Casey preparing them for the real world above.

It’s also likely that the final issue, which releases in late July, will feature more from them, which makes sense given that “The Lost Day,” a one-shot comic that hits shelves in late August, will follow these them in their entirety, as they officially replace the original Ninja Turtles.

IDW Publishing’s main “TMNT” comic book series is still ongoing. At the same time “The Last Ronin,” which takes place in an alternate timeline, is also set to continue, as co-creator Kevin Eastman previously confirmed that a third series is already in development.

But while the primary canon will continue, it seems fans are far more interested in “The Last Ronin.” Not only are waves of new toys based on the dark and gritty comic book series hitting shelves, but a brand-new “AAA game” is in the works, which is said to be heavily inspired by the Gods of War game series.

As per IDW, here’s the synopsis for “The Last Ronin — Lost Years”:

RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In the smash-hit miniseries TMNT: The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time — past, present, future — to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half Shell. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heart-breaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artist Ben Bishop (TMNT: The Last Ronin) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of… Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

,"Movies to watch in August, from 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' to 'Blue Beetle'","A video game adaptation, a pair of raunchy comedies, and more","To those who finally returned to theaters for the first time in forever thanks to ""Barbenheimer,"" welcome back! Movies are pretty cool, huh? Unfortunately, the summer movie season has likely peaked with the dual release of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" But there are still plenty of intriguing new releases in August, from a reboot of a beloved '80s property to a pair of raunchy comedies that could make for your next great double feature.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (Aug. 2)

Cowabunga! The ninja turtles are back for their first animated movie in more than 15 years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" following two live-action Michael Bay films. ""After years of being sheltered from the human world,"" the turtles set out to ""win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,"" per Paramount. Seth Rogen worked on the screenplay and voices Bebop, and the rest of the voice cast includes John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The turtles also have a new look, as the film's art style is reminiscent of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" With great turtle power comes great turtle responsibility.

""Meg 2: The Trench"" (Aug. 4)

What better way to close out the summer than with a big, dumb shark movie? Jason Statham returns in this sequel to ""The Meg,"" the 2018 surprise hit that saw him gloriously face off against a megalodon shark. This time, he and Wu Jing ""lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean,"" which ""spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival,"" per Warner Bros. It's based on the follow-up to the original novel, and the screenwriters from the first movie are back, though there's a new director: Ben Wheatley, the filmmaker known for disturbing horror movies like ""Kill List."" Hopefully, the sequel hasn't bitten off more than it can chew.

""Shortcomings"" (Aug. 4)

Randall Park has long been a delightful on-screen presence, but he's now ready to get behind the camera. Variety described Park's new dramedy ""Shortcomings"" as a ""fresh-faced, funny directorial debut"" for the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" star. From Sony Pictures Classics, the movie follows a struggling filmmaker, Ben (Justin H. Min), and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), who works for an Asian American film festival. ""When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want,"" the synopsis says. Sherry Cola stars as Ben's best friend Alice. Sony also described Ben as a man who ""spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women"" and ""watching Criterion Collection DVDs."" Wait, is this play about us?

""Heart of Stone"" (Aug. 11)

Gal Gadot's future as Wonder Woman may be in doubt, but if that gig falls through, at least she's got a home in the Netflix ecosystem. After starring in the streamer's ""Red Notice,"" Gadot returns for another Netflix original film that she also produced, the spy thriller ""Heart of Stone,"" in which she plays secret agent Rachel Stone. She's the ""only intelligence operative who stands between her global, peace-keeping organization and the loss of its most valuable — and dangerous — asset, codenamed: The Heart,"" per Netflix. Jamie Dornan also stars. Director Tom Harper told Entertainment Weekly the aim is for the film to spawn a new female-led action series like James Bond. In its attempt to craft more original franchises, Netflix is leaving no stone unturned.

""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" (Aug. 11)

If ""Renfield"" got you in the mood for more Dracula on the big screen, Universal has another movie for you. From ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" director André Øvredal, ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is based on a chapter from the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" novel, ""The Captain's Log,"" in which Dracula travels on board a merchant ship and things don't end well for those aboard. ""Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship,"" per Universal. Think of it as ""Alien,"" but on a boat and with Dracula instead of a Xenomorph. Corey Hawkins and Liam Cunningham star, and Javier Botet plays Dracula. With their help, for now, the Universal monsters franchise is alive.

""Gran Turismo"" (Aug. 11)

The race to find the next great video game movie is shifting gears with ""Gran Turismo."" David Harbour and Orlando Bloom star in this film based on the popular racing video games, though it's not a direct adaptation of them. Instead, it's inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, who became an actual race car driver after playing the video game competitively. The stakes are high for director Neill Blomkamp, who has struggled to follow up his critically-acclaimed debut film, 2009's ""District 9;"" his last two movies, ""Chappie"" and ""Demonic,"" were both widely panned. Can bringing a racing game to the big screen get his career back on track?

""Blue Beetle"" (Aug. 18)

The end of the DC universe as we know it is in sight, but it's not quite over yet. The DC Extended Universe still has two more films left before new boss James Gunn reboots the franchise. First up is ""Blue Beetle,"" in which a young college graduate, played by Xolo Maridueña, ""unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,"" which ""chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host,"" leading him to become the superhero Blue Beetle, per Warner Bros. Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first character of the new DC universe, suggesting he could stick around even after the upcoming reboot. But that likely depends on how well this film performs, as if it's another DC bomb, expect the character to be tossed aside as quickly as Ezra Miller's Flash.

""Strays"" (Aug. 18)

In June, Jennifer Lawrence did her part to keep comedies alive in theaters with ""No Hard Feelings,"" and ""Strays"" is now picking up the torch. This new comedy produced by ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller has a unique hook: it's a filthy, R-rated film starring a bunch of talking dogs. The pups ""hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie,"" a Border Terrier voiced by Will Ferrell, ""find his way home"" and make his ""lowlife owner"" pay for abandoning him. Jamie Foxx and Will Forte also flesh out the voice cast, and Dennis Quaid appears in the movie as himself. Will this barking dog comedy have bite?

""Bottoms"" (Aug. 25)

Two of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood today are Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri, but fans introduced to them though ""Shiva Baby"" and ""The Bear"" may not realize the two collaborated in 2020 on the digital shorts ""Ayo and Rachel Are Single."" Three years later, they're teaming back up for the raunchy sex comedy ""Bottoms,"" in which two girls ""start a fight club as a way to lose their virginities to cheerleaders,"" per MGM. Emma Seligman directed the film in her follow-up to ""Shiva Baby,"" and Sennott co-wrote it with Seligman. Marshawn Lynch also stars. The movie earned near universal acclaim at South by Southwest, with Mashable's Kristy Puchko calling it a ""ruthless and hysterical parody of the teen sex comedy."" This is one fight club everyone will be talking about.

""Retribution"" (Aug. 25)

We've got five words for you: ""Speed,"" but with Liam Neeson. If you're not already on board, you should be. The actor leads this new action-thriller in which a man receives a call from a mysterious person who tells him there's a bomb under his car seat. The caller demands he ""complete a specific series of tasks,"" and with ""his kids trapped in the back seat and a bomb that will explode if they get out of the car, a normal commute becomes a twisted game of life or death,"" per Lionsgate. Nimród Antal, the filmmaker behind 2010's ""Predators,"" directs, and Jack Champion and Matthew Modine also star. Following new blockbusters starring Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, it's the perfect conclusion to the summer of aging action stars proving they've still got it.

2023-08-11 22:51:17+00:00,Chris Pine has a cameo in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles newest film, Mutant Mayhem, has a blink and you miss it cameo from Chris Pine, well, sorta.","Why did the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds higher ups debut *that* character? by Chad Porto

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem had an unexpected Chris Pine cameo.

The sixth movie from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise premiered on Aug. 2, 2023, and is trending well with critics and fans alike. The new film, entitled, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem features the four titular teenage turtles as such, teenagers, who are lost and unsure about themselves as they move through the world.

It’s a heartfelt story, led by some wonderful voice work from the four young actors playing the titular Ninja Turtles. And while the four main characters were voiced by mostly unknown actors, the film still carries a hefty roster including Jackie Chan, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube, Hannibal Buress, and Paul Rudd.

Yet, despite all the big names that the film brought in to help support the young core cast, the film still found a way to fit in Chris Pine. Well, kinda, sorta.

Star Trek’s Chris Pine makes cameo in Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Pine’s cameo comes unannounced, and rather unexpected because he technically doesn’t appear in the film. In fact, it wasn’t Pine, so much as a cardboard cutout of his Star Trek character, James T. Kirk, which appears.

During a scene where Master Splinter is trying to convince his four teenage turtle sons to stay in the sewers and give up on trying to fit in among the humans, he pulls out three cardboard cutouts of various celebrities. One of those celebrations was in fact Pine as James Kirk.

While surprising to see a “Star Trek character” in the film, it’s not unexpected, as they’re both Paramount properties. Not only did Pine’s Kirk make a brief cameo, but so did the face of Nickelodeon, SpongeBob SquarePants.

The synergy was real in the film, as Paramount tries to bolster its animated offerings going forward. That said, while fans and critics alike have enjoyed the film, it doesn’t appear to be a financial success as it hasn’t even broken even with its budget, let alone the budget plus advertising.

If the TMNT film franchise can’t turn a profit, that will in fact hurt how Paramount views this, and other established animated IPs.

10 ways to embrace summer mayhem

Here are 10 ways to dive head-first into the chaos and make the most of the last weeks of summer.

1. Embrace spontaneity

This is a time to say “yes” to last-minute adventures, spontaneous outings, and unplanned activities. Relish in the excitement of the unknown. There’s freedom in allowing yourself to let go of expectations and go with the flow.

2. Take the mayhem to the movies

Get tickets now for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, only in theatres August 2. A movie day is the perfect way to escape the summer heat and relax while your kids get to know the world’s favorite Turtle brothers.

3. Explore the great outdoors

We finally figured out why our moms were always insisting we “go play outside!”—so we wouldn’t make a mess in the house. Head to a local park or nature center, or plan a picnic in the backyard. Encourage your kids to get dirty and interact with nature.

4. Create an end-of-summer bucket list

Sit down with your kids and create a list of fun and adventurous activities. Let them contribute their ideas, whether it’s camping in the backyard, building a fort, or making a ginormous ice cream sundae—and check them off together before school starts.

5. Plan a DIY pizza night

Gather some pie crusts, sauce and toppings, and let your kids go wild on making their own pizzas. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are known for their love of pizza and adventurous taste buds, so encourage your little chefs to experiment with unique combinations. Pepperoni and pickles? Sure! Guacamole and marshmallows? Go for it! (Maybe make a backup just in case their Ninja Turtle-inspired creations end up being more yuck than yum.)

6. Create a mutant science lab

Unleash the mayhem with a series of messy science experiments. Play around with different slime recipes incorporating vibrant colors, glitter and pompoms, or explore fizzing reactions with baking soda, vinegar and food coloring.

7. Host group hang-outs

The more mayhem, the merrier! Invite your mom friends and their kids over for a day of play—bust out the chalk, turn on the sprinkler, and sit back while your kids entertain each other for hours. Just be sure to have snacks on hand so you don’t have to move from your lounge chair!

8. Capture memories

Whether it’s with a Polaroid, an iPhone or an old-school tape recorder, capture the crazy and special moments with your kids—they’ll be some of your most treasured memories in the future when you want to reflect on the joyful chaos of your children’s childhood.

9. Have a family talent show

Encourage your kids to discover and showcase their unique talent, be it singing, dancing, telling jokes, puppetry, or performing magic tricks. Don’t forget—grown-ups must participate, too! Embrace the mayhem of rehearsals, funny moments and celebrating each others’ gifts.

10. Be present and enjoy the journey

Before you know it, summer will be over—the days will be shorter, and you’ll be back to packing lunches, juggling drop-offs and trying to decipher Common Core math homework. Live in the now and enjoy the ride!

,Seth Rogen Talks Remaking 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Starring Actual Teenagers (Exclusive),'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' hits theaters on Aug. 2.,"Everyone's favorite sewer-dwelling, pizza-gobbling, crime-fighting reptiles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, but this time there's one major difference -- the titular turtles are actually played by teenagers!

""They're often middle-aged men doing Teenage-Voiced Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" joked Seth Rogen when he sat down with ET's Will Marfuggi to talk about how a life-long love of the titular turtles led to writing and producing the latest installment in the long-running franchise.

""I was really the target audience for the first iteration of all this stuff,"" he explained, noting that he watched the TMNT cartoons and movies as a kid and was ""obsessed"" with the toys. ""My dad bought like, a big box of used Ninja Turtle toys at a garage sale when I was a kid, and so I had those and I played with them so much.""

However, Rogen admitted, ""I always thought that the 'Teenage' part of it was weirdly under-explored, you know?""

For his movie, the Dumb Money star added in more details about the turtles' desire to be just regular teens, and wanted the cast to be made up of voice actors that were closer in age to their characters than past iterations.

The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star Brady Noon, 17, is Raphael, the bravest and strongest -- but also most impulsive -- of his brothers, who wears a red mask and fights with two pronged sai weapons.

Paramount Pictures

The Amazing World of Gumball's Nicolas Cantu, 19, plays Leonardo, ""the leader and the most honorable and responsible"" of the turtles, who wears blue and wields two katana.

Paramount Pictures

Cousins for Life star Micah Abbey, 15, plays the ""wise and resourceful"" Donatello, who wears a purple mask and wields a bō staff.

Paramount Pictures

And The Chi's Shamon Brown Jr., 19, is Michelangelo, the heart and charismatic soul of the family. ""Mikey,"" as his brothers call him, dons an orange mask and primarily fights with nunchucks, though he's wielded other weapons throughout the years.

Paramount Pictures

""It's always [been] the same kind of energy, from the beginning,"" Brown Jr. said of stepping into a beloved role that multiple actors have played throughout the years. ""Mikey, personally, being like the funny one and you know, the loving one, I kind of embodied that in to this, just [adding] the modern day feel to it.""

Part of that modern feel, Rogen admitted, came from letting the core foursome improvise and inject some modern-day teen speak to make up for the old, outdated ""cowabungas"" -- which would feel totally anachronistic in 2023.

""I think it was so important that the freedom that Jeff [Rowe, Mutant Mayhem director] and Seth gave us and kind of the trust that they put into us being like, 'I think these kids know the generation better then we do as older men,'"" Noon shared, earning a guffaw from Rogen. ""I think that that was really important that we just had that trust and [knew] certain slangs that we can put into the film to make it better understanding for our generation.""

""Most of it was just Seth and Jeff giving us like, the reins to be crazy,"" Cantu agreed, recalling that Rogen and Rowe would often hear the boys joking around off-camera and ask them to recreate the dialogue in the booth.

""We cast them well and we just knew if they were essentially themselves, honestly, that it would convey the right dynamic and it would be the right energy,"" Rogen noted. ""That was like so helpful and it's why the movie feels natural, and I think why you stop thinking of them as turtles and you start thinking of them as teenagers within like, 30 seconds of seeing them on screen.""

For Rogen, it was an exercise in feeling a bit out of his depth as a writer.

""A large part of it was acknowledging, like, I don't know how these kids talk anymore,"" he admitted. ""When we wrote Superbad, we had such a handle of how 18-year-olds in 2004 spoke, you know what I mean? But now it's like 20 years later... We don't want to sound like 40-year-old men writing for teenagers.""

""I don't know half the stuff they say in the movie,"" he joked, teasing the cast, ""I signed off on it. I've heard since that it's really offensive.""

The film also stars Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rogen as Bebop, John Cena as Rocksteady, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito and Maya Rudolph.

Thanks to an LAFC soccer player who's also an adoptive father, Ryan Hollingshead, an invitation went out to some former foster youth to attend a preview of the newest movie in the popular franchise.

The VIP showing for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem was held at the AMC Del Amo 18 at Del Amo Fashion Center. Fifty-plus people got the invite from FOX 11's Wednesday's Child foster care/adoption program and had the theater to themselves.

Tyraughn Barnett was among the former foster youth who aged out of the system. He shared his tickets with the band director at the high school in which he volunteers, Banning High, who brought his children.

Barnett got emotional in sharing his relationship with the school and his childhood. He was 13 years old when he was first on FOX 11 and in foster care. He's now 31.

You've come. You've turtled. You've got questions about that mid-credits sequence.

We're here to help.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem follows the coming-of-age adventure of turtle-human hybrids, Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.). who dream above all else of going to high school and being cool.

After a fateful meeting with teen reporter April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the boys decide they'll win over both the local New York City high schoolers and the whole metro area — if only they could heroically capture the notorious villain Superfly, who's been pulling off heists and knocking off local criminals. If they can do what the NYPD — and the super shady Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI) — cannot, not only are they sure to be beloved, but the school will likely un-cancel prom! (And maybe Leo can go with his newly minted crush, April?)

What happened in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem mid-credits scene?

April and the turtles

Credit: Paramount

Once the turtles realize that Superfly is 1) A mutant like themselves, and 2) dead-set on using his stolen tech and sci-fi brain to eradicate mankind and make all other animals into mutants, the whole ""we have to save prom"" plotline gets pretty sidelined. Now, they have to save the world — and not just for street cred.

After the day is saved with little help from their friends, the brothers head back to the sewer, where their mutant cousins have all moved in, bringing new life and sloppy cockroach kisses to their chosen family. This kooky cluster of critters sees them off on their first day of high school, where they ditch their ninja masks for human clothes, like khakis, polo shirts, wild-printed button-downs, hoodies, and baggy jeans. (Still in their signature colors of course!)

Thanks to their televised saving of the city, the boys are embraced by the students as soon as they walk down the hall. And April has been redeemed, her graffitied locker no longer reading ""puke girl,"" but ""cool girl!""

However, in the mid-credits sequence, directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears reward those patiently waiting in the audience with a peek at the uncanceled prom!

The mid-credits sequence begins with a montage of the boys finding their footing in high school. Donnie turns on his camera phone and rejoices that he's found a community of fellow anime lovers. Mikey is hamming it up with the improv troupe he dreamed of joining. Raph has joined the wrestling team, naturally. And Leo is helping April with the next step in her investigation: What's the deal with TCRI?

Then, amid this study-buddy setting, Leo asks April to prom, and she says yes!

Cut to: all the turtles having a blast at the big dance, where April accidentally sneak-attacks Leo by noting they're attending as friends.

Before we can dwell too hard on Leo getting crushed by his crush, the movie cuts to surveillance footage of the heroes on the half-shell at prom. TCRI — specifically its malicious leader Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) — are watching them. And that's not all. She's got a housefly in a container, which we can safely assume is the de-mutant-ized Superfly. And, she declares, ""Bring me the Shredder.""

Boom: The familiar spiky silhouette of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' most iconic enemy lurks, overlooking the Manhattan skyline.

What does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem mean for a sequel?

Paramount has already announced a sequel and spinoff series for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and this mid-credits sequence suggests TCRI, Cynthia, and Shredder will play a big role.

In the first act, Cynthia's minions ambushed and killed scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) to steal his special ooze. She'll clearly stop at nothing to pursue her plan of weaponizing the ooze to make hybrid soldiers for unnamed armies. Presumably, Cynthia isn't done trying to milk the turtles of their mutant juices (just as their father Splinter feared!) And, weirdly, the brothers did not demolish that milking machine, so that's a very real threat!

However, Cynthia now knows her armed-to-the-teeth human soldiers are no match for a mutated rat and his four turtle sons. Plus, that family has now got all their mutated cousins in their crew! So, here comes The Shredder and presumably his Foot Clan army.

TCRI will clearly be the overarching evil of the rebooted franchise. But there's a clue in Cynthia's last name about how she, specifically, might become a next-level menace to the turtles. ""Utrom"" is the name of an alien species in TMNT canon. So, Cynthia might be hiding a secret of her own. More importantly, Utrom is the species that the globby brain-like monster Krang comes from in past TMNT incarnations. So...could Maya Rudolph's ruthless exec become the next Krang? (Not to be confused with the MCU's Kang.)

Shredder, on the other hand, is typically the archnemesis of the Turtles. In the past, he's been a rival ninja, who hates Splinter. But Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has been playing with the standard TMNT backstory, it's hard to assume too much about this Shredder. However, there is a potential clue in the first half of the movie.

When Splinter ushers audiences into a flashback of how he became the turtles' adoptive father, he recounts how he once took them to Times Square so they could see human culture up close. The tourists and New Yorkers in the city's shiniest bauble lost their cool, chasing the ""Ratman"" down a dark alley. Splinter specifically notes one man would not give up the chase, and the flashback shows a man with a bat, backlit so you can't see his face.

At first, it seemed this might be a nod to the sports-gear-wielding vigilante Casey Jones. But what if this human, who Splinter had to escape to save his sons — was the Shredder? Did Splinter defensively deface this attacker? Does he carry a grudge?

And what about Superfly? Is he just a fly for good? Or will Cynthia give him another shot at that hybrid life in hopes he'll turn on the turtles and all of his mutant family, who he feels betrayed him?

We'll have to wait and see when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem gets its sequel or spinoff series.

Thanks to the nature of the medium, actors in animation don't have to be in the same room together to share a scene. In most productions, actors' voices are recorded and edited ahead of time, and the animators add their physical acting after the fact. It's typically more common for animated productions to record each of their actors separately, then edit together a vocal track before the animation begins. Indeed, if one has ever seen a behind-the-scenes video of voice actors in a booth, one might see how recording lines can become very tedious as actors will have to repeat single lines over and over again until the director hears a take they like. It's quite rare for actors to play out entire scenes the way they appear in a final animated product.

In certain television shows over the years, however, that practice has been eschewed. Some producers prefer their actors retain their ability to play off each other, reacting in real-time, talking over each other, and generally lending a more natural performance to the show in question. This was famously done for shows like ""Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,"" ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""The Powerpuff Girls,"" and ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" all of which liked to gather as much of their cast as possible into one recording booth.

In movies, entire-cast recordings are all but unheard of, save for a few notable pairings. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, for instance, recorded their lines together for ""Toy Story,"" as did John Goodman and Billy Crystal for ""Monsters, Inc."" Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro shared a booth for ""Shark Tale."" And, according to a recent behind-the-scenes interview with executive producer Seth Rogen, the four lead actors of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (in theaters August 2) did the same.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM0MTk4Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmVjb3JkZWQtdG9nZXRoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 17:51:50+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: Superfly’s Revenge,"This time around, the four kung-fu-fighting old masters of the sewers dream of having a normal life with the humans. But not if Ice Cube can help it.","There’s a refreshing sense of nostalgia in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” — and it doesn’t just have to do with the fact that the eternally youthful ninja turtles have been around since the 1980s, in the form of the original comic book series, as well as TV adaptations, films, toys and video games.
It’s in the very look of the movie: meticulous computer-generated animation remixed with lively doodles and scribbles, splotches of color and unclean lines — the kind of art that would come from the combination of a free period, a pack of Sharpies and a composition notebook. After all, what’s more adolescent than that?
You probably already know the back story: Four cute little turtles get transformed by radioactive ooze and are adopted and raised underground, in the sewers of New York, by a rat named Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan) who’s a master of martial arts. They’re all big fans of pizza.
Now, as teenagers, the turtles — pugnacious Raphael (Brady Noon), doofy Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), nerdy Donatello (Micah Abbey) and their ever-earnest leader, Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) — dream of having a normal life with humans. But the aboveground masses face their own threat: Another mutated creature, Superfly (Ice Cube), aims to overtake the human world, Magneto-style. The turtles team up with a student journalist named April (Ayo Edebiri) to try to save the day and hopefully be accepted into human society.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDIvbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-04 16:50:47.996000-04:00,‘TMNT: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: A Marvel of Animation,"The easygoing ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,’ produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is a marvel of animation.","Photo: Courtesy of Paramount Pictures./B)2023 Paramount Pictures.TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES is a trademark of Viacom International Inc.
Leonardo (the leader), Donatello (the tech wiz), Raphael (the brawn), and Michelangelo (party dude) have been played by guys in foam latex costumes designed by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop. They’re CGI creations with the smooth, plastic look of an earlier era of digital animation, and, more recently, they’ve been disconcertingly brawny with prominent nostrils and an overtly scaly texture. In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the characters’ seventh big-screen outing, they look different yet again — this time as though someone colored them in with markers and then added details with a ballpoint pen. After a three-decade journey toward something approaching realism, the turtles are no longer trying to resemble actual terrapins who’ve mutated into human-size bipedal beings, maybe because that prospect is actually terrifying. Now they bring to mind a heightened version of something a kid might doodle on the inside of a binder during class, the perfect take on characters who began life as a parody of superhero comics. They’ve never looked better.
They’ve also never looked younger, apart from flashbacks of them as babies. Mutant Mayhem, which comes from The Mitchells vs. the Machines co-director Jeff Rowe, leans hard into the “teenage” aspect of the foursome, with a young cast (Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr.) voicing characters whose deepest desire is to emerge from the sewers and enroll in high school. TV reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) has also been reimagined as a kid, turned into a scooter-riding aspiring journalist whose interest in investigating New York’s recent crime wave is guided by her desire to reinstate her canceled prom and thereby fix her outcast status. These choices give the movie an easygoing sweetness, turning it into a coming-of-age story as much as it is one about saving the world. It eventually gets to that too, of course, but not in a hurry. The movie is much more interested in hanging out with these characters as they do things like film themselves doing IRL Fruit Ninja stunts.
In this iteration, the turtles’ mutant-rat mentor Splinter (Jackie Chan) is more like an overprotective parent scarred from rough encounters with humanity, and despite having trained with him, the boys haven’t ever been in a real fight before the film begins. They begin looking for the culprit behind some recent robberies, the mysterious Superfly (Ice Cube), only because they have ulterior motives. The plan is for April, who becomes their first human friend after an unfortunate throwing-star incident, to document the turtles catching the baddie, winning them acceptance from a city otherwise inclined to treat them like monsters. Instead, they discover that Superfly is an actual fly as well as the head of a band of fellow mutants, among them warthog Bepop (Seth Rogen), rhino Rocksteady (John Cena), alligator Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), bat Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), the self-explanatory Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), and manta ray Ray Fillet (yes, Post Malone). These mutants also crave acceptance from the rest of the world, though they’re going about it the blunt-force way, by aiming to turn all the other creatures out there into mutants in order to become the majority.
Mutant Mayhem, which Rowe wrote with producers Rogen and Evan Goldberg as well as Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, sometimes comes off as a little too slack, with its teen-dirtbag ’90s hip-hop vibe leaning toward oddly languid for a movie that’s for kids as much as it is about them (in turtle form). But it’s just so charming anyway. The turtles’ unceasing, rapid-fire banter is all affectionate dunks on one another and pop-culture quips, and the look of the film is never less than entrancing, with computer animation that creates the feel of something handmade. Like the Spider-Verse movies, Mutant Mayhem thrums with all the possibilities of its medium, an ebullience that escalates as it approaches a chaotic finale that evokes the kaiju genre as much as it does Ghostbusters-era comedies about New York grubbiness. It’s a final act that could only work in animation and is downright joyous to behold because of it. This medium, for all of its recent and illuminating labor issues, remains the painstaking work of talented artists, and there’s something lovely about the way Spider-Verse, with its Ben Day dots, and Mutant Mayhem, with its scribbles of pen line shading, evoke the analog past despite being made using the latest advancements in technology. Those touches give these films a sense of life and warmth that can’t be ignored.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXJldmlldy1hLW1hcnZlbC1vZi1hbmltYXRpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie review (2023),There are undeniably strong visuals here and enough creative voice work to make it tolerable on a hot August day when families are looking for an air-conditioned theater for a few hours.,"Yes, it’s another origin story. Despite being the seventh film to feature these characters, Rowe and co-writers Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg go back to the beginning of the TMNT saga, opening with a scientist named Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) creating the infamous ooze that turns ordinary creatures into mutants. When the authorities break into Baxter’s basement lair, the ooze is spilled into the sewers, and the rest is comic book history as a quartet of turtles becomes fast-talking humanoid creatures named Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Raphael (Brady Noon).
Fans of the franchise know that the turtles are nothing without their leader, Splinter (Jackie Chan), a rat who was also transformed by the ooze and became the father to the teenage mutants after teaching them the ninja skills to protect themselves. Splinter is extremely overprotective, ordering the boys to stay away from human beings at all costs or risk being milked by them (don't ask). A flashback reveals that Splinter tried to introduce himself and the turtles to the humans, but they were somewhat understandably terrified. Now they all live underground, as the turtles sneak out to get supplies and wish they could have a normal teenage life beyond the sewers.
Meanwhile, one of Baxter’s experiments responds very differently to the chasm between the human race and the mutants now living underground. Whereas Splinter wants to hide, Superfly (Ice Cube) wants something closer to vengeance. He’s assembled a group of mutants that include Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Rocksteady (John Cena), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Ray Fillet (Post Malone), Bebop (Seth Rogen), and Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd). Throw in Maya Rudolph as a mysterious figure trying to find the turtles and Ayo Edebiri as April, the human being who befriends the turtles and tries to introduce them to the above-ground world, and you have a stellar voice cast. Once Superfly and his cadre of creatures join the action, “Mutant Mayhem” gets exponentially more fun as each great actor is allowed fun voice beats to shine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 18:38:41.776000+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Review,"The animated film oozes confidence, energy, and heart, and the animated adventure represents a new high for the Turtles on the big screen.","The Spider-Verse movies cast a long web of shadows over Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Those vibrant Spidey adventures and the Turtles’ latest cinematic outing all represent modern reinventions of beloved superheroes that use the freedom of animation to express their stories in ways their live-action counterparts can't. Mutant Mayhem may be surfing onto the scene in Miles’ and Gwen’s wake, but the broad similarities fall out of focus quickly and, thanks to a punkier, more ground-level approach, Mutant Mayhem – from The Mitchells vs. The Machines co-director Jeff Rowe – is a vibrant, hilarious adventure from which the Heroes in a Half Shell can ( and will ) build a Turtleverse all their own.
Mutant Mayhem takes the broad strokes of Turtle lore largely for granted, opting for a streamlined introduction to Splinter (Jackie Chan) and his adopted sons: Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), and Donatello (Micah Abbey). From the start, the movie is far more interested in their relationship with Splinter as a father than as a master, with Splinter’s strong prejudice against humans forcing the Turtles to disobey him so they can be a part of the surface world like they’ve always dreamed. Mutant Mayhem makes the simple, yet seismic choice to do what comparatively few adaptations of Eastman and Laird’s comics have done before and lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the Mutant Ninja Turtles. There’s no going back: the infectious, talky banter the 15-year-old brothers generate amongst themselves and others is effortless and quotable, with an unpredictable dark streak that ensures laughs from all age groups.

Seemingly anticipating comparisons to other superhero stories, Mutant Mayhem opts to go with the flow and use that masks-and-capes landscape as the very context in which the Turtles hope to be seen. These are Turtles who know what’s going on in the MCU, and have learned (or been taught) that their abilities are the quickest way to win public approval. It’s that tension between what the Turtles want from the world, and what the world expects from them in return, that sees Mutant Mayhem’s storytelling at its most mature.
But most of the heavy lifting on that score goes to the world-weary Splinter. Jackie Chan’s portrayal of the rodent sensei is a constant source of warmth, with off-the-charts single-dad energy. A flashback covers the necessities of the family’s ooze-fuelled origin, but any of the mutation details therein are completely outshined by the effervescent moments of connection and growth among this sewer-dwelling family. That scene sets up Splinter’s reasonably justified distrust of humans, and the conflict it creates once the Turtles yearn to be where the people are a little more regularly.

The Turtles themselves all end up rallying around a desire to be accepted and loved by humans that doesn’t give them much room to disagree with each other, leaving them more interesting as a group than as individuals. Leonardo, predictably, gets a little more focus on his struggle to find confidence as team leader, but how and why he comes to identify with that responsibility isn’t tracked very closely through the story. That’s not to say that each Turtle doesn’t have a crystal-clear personality, largely in line with what you’d expect of each: Raph’s a rage-filled bruiser, Donnie’s super-smart, Mikey’s a goofball, Leo’s… the leader… but critically, Mutant Mayhem significantly tones down the cartoonish heights of their personalities. None of the Turtles ever feels like he’s trying to copy a version that’s come before – again, huge win there in casting actual teenagers in these roles.
Mutant Mayhem’s art style is perfectly suited to the crackling energy that drives the story forward. The bespoke characters interact with a comparatively realistic New York, and the relationship between the elasticity of the character animation and the more logic-based digital cinematography is a constant reminder of the ways the Turtles stick out in society. There’s a scribbled, rough quality that reveals finer and finer detail the closer you look, which evokes the movie's themes of prejudice and tolerance quite subtly. That inventiveness carries across to the action, where Rowe is not going for subtlety, and the Turtles move and strike with every use of their sai, katana, nunchaku, and bo staff accounted for. Mutant Mayhem’s killer visuals are pushed along by an absolute vibefest of a musical score, which I was totally enamored by and then later deeply unsurprised to learn came from the Oscar-winning Nine Inch Nails team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It’s a synth-dripping, flame-throwing grungescape that elevates the action and emotion at every turn.

The boundless energy and wonderfully drawn characters make up for a predictable plot, which itself feels like a bit of a mutated amalgamation of other superhero movies. It’s hard to begrudge Mutant Mayhem too much for that – it’s got as much right to celebrate its comics roots as any other superhero movie – but the notion that Everyday, Normal New Yorkers are the real heroes of these movies is losing its impact. And with how grounded the Turtles’ emotional throughline actually is, the world-ending stakes that mutant villain Superfly (Ice Cube) represents isn't as interesting as whether or not Splinter’s gonna let the kids go to the arcade more regularly by the end of the movie.
Superfly’s mutant henchanimals are the best character designs in the movie, with proportions and rough edges that make them feel like notebook sketches that have burst to life. The mutants are largely voiced by actors in co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s orbit: John Cena plays the Rocksteady to Rogen’s Bebop, while the earnest enthusiasm for life expressed by Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, and Hannibal Burress makes the genetic monstrosities they’re playing as endearing as the heroes. Special mention here goes to Byrne as Leatherhead – someone told her “sound more Australian than anyone has ever let you sound” and her performance is so Aussie, it'd make a toilet drain clockwise.
As is custom, the Turtles find an ally in intrepid reporter April O’Neil, and Ayo Edebiri’s self-effacing performance is another bright spot among Mutant Mayhem’s strong voice cast. After stumbling out of the gate with her budding school journalism career, April finds camaraderie with the outcast turtles and Edebiri’s deadpan reality checks keep the Turtles on track as their flights of heroic fancy start to take hold.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 16:00:01+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem review – evergreen superheroes rise up from the drains,"This new animated origin story for the reptilian fighters is unexpectedly funny, with a starry voice cast including Jackie Chan, Ice Cube and Giancarlo Esposito","Here once again are the strangest ever comic-book heroes; they have featured in movies and TV shows for decades but are still so evergreen in their oddity that their wacky high-concept premise – mutant masked underground crime-fighting turtles with a love of pizza and the names of Renaissance artists – pretty much has to be explained all over again every time they are revived.
Well, this new animated origin story for the chelonian adventurers is unexpectedly funny, with a rather stylish crepuscular design. You’ve heard of the Spider-Verse; this is the Turtle-Verse, and it is directed by Jeff Rowe, who co-created The Mitchells vs the Machines, and co-written by Rowe, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, with Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit.
We go back 15 years to when a lonely, tormented scientist, Dr Stockman (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito) went rogue and created a bunch of bizarre mutant embryos in an underground lab. An attempt by his sinister corporate minders to bring him in ended in chaos; these four monsters wound up escaping but a greeny-glowing phial of the gooey gloop that supposedly creates the mutant-ness accidentally tumbled down the New York drain and infected four baby turtles being looked after down there by Splinter, a fugitive fighting rat (voiced by Jackie Chan) who schools them in martial arts.
They grew up to be Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr), Raphael (Brady Noon) and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), teen mutant turtles longing for adventures in the above-ground world. They take on Stockman’s now fully adult mutant monster Superfly (Ice Cube) with the reluctant support of high-schooler and wannabe journalist April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri). But all the time their overprotective quasi-dad Splinter warns them that humans may capture them and try to “milk” them, even though they have no nipples.
It’s a confrontation that leads to an X-Men style debate as to how much of a rapprochement there can ever be between humans and mutants. The turtles’ crime-fighting mission to save those very ungrateful humans who are so suspicious of them is amiable and enjoyable, although a quibble is that Rowe, Rogen et al skate around the refined humanist mystery of their names. These writers are clearly happier with pop culture gags about Chris Pine and so on – and there’s a lot of funny material – and do not want to venture into Kenneth Clark/Civilisation territory, however facetiously. A shame. Perhaps the sequel can take us to the Uffizi in Florence.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8yNy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmV2aWV3LWV2ZXJncmVlbi1zdXBlcmhlcm9lcy1qYWNraWUtY2hhbi1pY2UtY3ViZS1naWFuY2FybG8tZXNwb3NpdG_SAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMjcvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXJldmlldy1ldmVyZ3JlZW4tc3VwZXJoZXJvZXMtamFja2llLWNoYW4taWNlLWN1YmUtZ2lhbmNhcmxvLWVzcG9zaXRv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review,Totally radical!,"Whereas an inherent lack of identity in a film like Elemental from animation juggernaut Pixar earlier this summer proves the company seems to be grappling with relevance and a fundamental misunderstanding of the makeup of its audience, newly minted Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem from celebrated Hollywood stoner Seth Rogen and longtime writing/producing partner Evan Goldberg captures that certain something special that speaks to moviegoers of all ages.
Let us tip our caps, of course, to the recent format-busting Spider-Verse animated movies for establishing the market desire for offbeat art styles, but Rogen and company have something special on their hands with their new animated property.
See, Elemental (and other recent-ish Pixar properties) have struggled to adapt to various ages. Are the Disney-owned studio’s films aimed at today’s kids and their sensibilities? The parents? Neither, it turns out, at least not effectively—oh, how their ‘90s heyday feels so, so long ago! Rogen, however, understands the sweet spot lies in using characters that aging nerds recognize, but designing them, writing them and executing them specifically for kids from the internet era. The older dorks who grew up with TMNT react to new takes on characters they know and love, the younger generations go wild for age-specific humor.
In the newest outing for the fearsome fighting teens, heroes Leo (Nicolas Cantu), Donnie (Micah Abbey), Mikey (Shamon Brown Jr.) and Raph (Brady Noon) long to coexist with the human world. Their adoptive father, the rat-man Splinter (a very funny Jackie Chan), forbids this—humans and mutants don’t get along! Enter April O’Neil (The Bear’s Ayo Edebiri), a high school-aged would-be journalist with a penchant for investigation who becomes the recipient of some ninja-based assistance and accepts the turtles; together, they investigate a series of crimes throughout New York City. The turtles, they reckon, will be accepted by society if they do hero stuff.
It’s not totally a spoiler to say that it’s mutants behind the crimes, but this is where the new TMNT truly shines: embracing the weirdo offshoot characters from the old TMNT days that mainly showed up as toys—characters like cyborg alligator Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), über-’90s skateboarding lizard Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), the bizarre Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), the impossibly land-based stingray Ray Filet (Post Malone) and the inimitably strange bat Wingnut (What We Do in the Shadows’ Natasia Demetriou) among others. The soft-reboot of the series mainly excels in the hand-drawn look to the 3D computer animation, though.
Even so, each turtle now has its own notable identity, thanks both to the writing’s homage to longtime traits set down since the early days of TMNT and the standout performances of the core four’s teen voice actors. Reworking April as a teen helps, too, as it’s strange, in retrospect, that a bunch of teenage turtles were cavorting through NYC with a grown woman/professional journalist. Like, she just hung out with a bunch of teens? Weird. Edebiri’s nuanced take on the character is wildly enjoyable, too, and the interplay between April and the turtles is consistently funny and heartwarming while avoiding schmaltz.
Mutant Mayhem’s risky take on established properties makes it a winner that brings them into the now while paying the proper respect to their roots. Cowabunga, dudes.

2023-08-03 15:46:19.733000+00:00,Mutant Mayhem is a grody and gorgeous reintroduction to the TMNT,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem knocks it out of the park with a straightforward story elevated by phenomenally inspired art direction and sharp action.,"There has seldom been a moment during the past 20 years when there wasn’t a relatively new spin on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles airing on TV, playing in movie theaters, or appearing in comic books, which is part of what made director Jeff Rowe’s Mutant Mayhem animated feature such a curious surprise when it was first announced. With there being so many different modern takes on the characters first created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, it wasn’t all that clear what more that could be done with them that 4Kids, Warner Bros., Nickelodeon, and parent company Paramount hadn’t already tried multiple times over.
Narratively, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is such a classic and straightforward Turtle tale that it’ll ring almost too familiar to anyone who knows the heroes in a half shell — especially those who’ve kept up with the franchise over the past couple of years. But between the movie’s delightfully grimy art direction, its hyper-kinetic action sequences, and its quintet of strong, pointedly youthful lead performances, Mutant Mayhem is also hands down one of the most exciting and definitive outings the Ninja Turtles have ever had.
Set largely in the slime-filled sewers of New York City, Mutant Mayhem tells the slightly updated story of how Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) grew up to become pizza-munching, anthropomorphic, reptilian crime fighters after being exposed to mutagenic ooze as ordinary baby turtles.

After years of living in secret and being raised by their similarly mutated adoptive rat-turned-father figure, Splinter (Jackie Chan), the boys all know just how dangerous the surface and the humans who call it home can be for people who aren’t considered “normal.” But as teenage boys who’ve spent their entire lives being forced to hide in the shadows and made to practice their ninjutsu arts strictly for self-defense, the brothers can’t help but be curious about the bright, bustling world above that’s always been just out of their reach.
Almost all of the early beats in Mutant Mayhem’s script from Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit feel like the movie checking off a list of TMNT basics for newcomers. But it breezes through them with a swift and stylish precision that telegraphs Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears’ razor-sharp sense for crafting the bigger, busier action sequences that come later on and brilliantly showcases Arthur Fong and Tiffany Lam Almack’s absolutely stunning art direction.
While the Ninja Turtles have been varying degrees of cute, “cool,” and alarming, throughout their almost 40-year-long history, there’s always been an innate ick factor to them that’s a big part of their appeal. Mutant Mayhem’s Turtles are still a gaggle of sewer-dwelling teenage boys who don’t clean behind their ears because they’re not entirely sure if they have them. But one of Mutant Mayhem’s most brilliant moves is the way it parlays the TMNT brand’s classic grossness into a more expansive grotesque aesthetic that defines the entire world around the Turtles, but — interestingly — not the Turtles themselves.
Unlike the Turtles, who — despite being unique in small ways — all share a recognizable symmetrical wholeness, basically every single human who appears in Mutant Mayhem is rendered as a kind of artfully bizarre nightmare person whose faces all feel like reflections of the city (and humanity’s) ugliness. It’s as true of the innocent strangers the Turtles sneak by during their bodega runs as it is of ​​Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) — the villainous head of the research lab desperately trying to replicate the process that led to the mutagenic ooze’s creation. But it’s not at all the case with high school student April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), whose chance encounter with the Turtles one evening gives them all hope that they might finally have a shot at making some real new friends.

Occasionally, Mutant Mayhem might feel a bit too packed with pop culture and brand references for its own good — particularly to older theatergoers who lived through previous corporate marketing blitzes designed to turn people into lifelong Turtles fans. But everything about Mutant Mayhem’s quippy sense of humor, its scribbly / sketchy visual language, and its focus on the Turtles’ obsession with the surface is meant to remind you that — in addition to being mutant ninjas — they’re a bunch of goofy kids that actual children are meant to be able to relate to in an organic way.
It’s exactly the sort of vibe that a reboot meant to kick off a new era of films and spinoff series should have, and while it remains to be seen whether Paramount can really keep this momentum going long term, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the studio’s absolutely knocked it out of the park.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgxNzI5Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Variety reports that Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies are planning to produce a Mutant Mayhem follow-up film as well as an all-new streaming series that will serve as the connective tissue between the two movies. The 2D series — Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — has already been greenlit for two seasons, produced by Nickelodeon Animation and Point Grey Pictures, and will be co-showrun and executive produced by Chris Yost and Alan Wan.
Actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon will also be reprising their roles as Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael, and the show will reportedly follow as each of the Turtles try flying solo for the first time in their lives.
The rush to get more of the Mutant Mayhem-era Turtles on people’s screens is very in line with Paramount CEO Brian Robbins’ recent comments about the company seeing value in trying to cater to millennials with revamped pieces of established IP. But considering how much of the excitement around the new movie is wrapped up in its unique 3D aesthetic, a 2D spinoff might not necessarily be what audiences are looking for.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzcvMjYvMjM4MDg2OTQvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tYXloZW0tc2VxdWVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 03:16:49.588000+00:00,Ninja Turtles seem truly like teenagers in ‘Mutant Mayhem’,"More than ever, franchise’s new adventure gives itself over to the mindset of adolescence.","There are some good gags and clever innovations in the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” but there is one brilliant idea: casting Ice Cube as the voice of the movie’s mutant insect supervillain Super Fly.
It might have once been hard to foresee the value of having the MC who rapped of “dropping bombs on your moms” as the MVP of a PG-rated kids movie. But we’re now up to the seventh “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film, not counting all the series and videogames. That’s a lot of movies for a bit of IP that’s clung more firmly to lunch boxes than it has to pop culture. For the turtles, it was getting to be time to either, as Ice Cube would say, “chickity-check yo’ self” or try something new.
“Mutant Mayhem” can’t entirely get over the feeling of trodding over well-covered turtle ground. But if we must go once more into the ooze, the film by director Jeff Rowe (co-director of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and co-written by co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is probably the best of a not-so-stellar franchise. It’s certainly the one most invested with that “teenage” part of the turtles’ name. Plus, it’s got Ice Cube as a fly who quotes from the O’Jays.
‘‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’
Untitled Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Jeff Rowe and written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit. Running time: 99 minutes. Rated PG (for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material). Now showing at local theaters.
The animation is vividly textured, the beat is persistently hip-hop (Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and others pack the electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and the New York of the film is impressively detailed. But the most important twist to this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” iteration may be diving into the teenage-ness of its 15-year-old turtles.
If “Barbie” was balanced between Greta Gerwig’s childhood memories and her adult feminism, “Mutant Mayhem” gives itself over more fully to the mindset of adolescence. That’s in the gross-out humor and the comic book-like feel of the animation. But these are also recognizable teenagers who watch movies (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”), pine for concert tickets and make goofy phone videos of themselves slicing watermelons.
What Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) and Raphael (Brady Noon) really want is to fit in and go to high school like other teens. They have been relegated to the sewer ever since Splinter, a rat voiced by Jackie Chan, happened upon them after they were exposed as hatchlings to the same ooze that spawned Super Fly — who himself was the product of experiments by scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito, fated to dubious laboratories).
Splinter has much the same opinion of the majority of the rats in “Ratatouille”: Humans can’t be trusted. (Splinter’s particular fear is that they will “milk” him.) So the turtles have grown up undergroundwhile yearning for the wider world.
They find a hint of it with a high-school journalist named April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), who wants to document, and thus prove to humankind, their decency. At the same, the turtles meet the charismatic Super Fly and his band of mutants. At first, they’re fast-friends — “cousins,” Super Fly says — but the turtles then start hearing of Super Fly’s plans to turn all animals into mutants and eradicate the world of humans.
“Peoples, they got to go,” chimes one mutant.
Some of the thunder of “Mutant Mayhem” has been stolen by “Into the Spider-Verse” and this year’s “Across the Spider-Verse” — films that likewise upend the typical look of studio animation and do it with a pulsing soundtrack; but they did it more eclectically.
Yet this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” while a half shell of those films, has its own low-key charms. It’s goofier, grosser and mostly fun. The four turtles are never more than a hard-to-differentiate bale of overlapping dialogue of doubt and anxiety. But that first word in their name finally feels genuine. Seven films in, it’s only right that Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael should get a renaissance.

2023-08-01 21:51:09+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Review,Any TMNT fan is going to have a blast with this movie as it provides references to the past while still carving itself a new identity.,"Any TMNT fan is going to have a blast with this movie as it provides references to the past while still carving itself a new identity.
PLOT: Follows the Turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing down an army of mutants.
REVIEW: I count myself as a massive fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Whether it’s the old cartoon show, the live actions films of the 90’s, or even the original comic book. While I didn’t vibe with the Michael Bay-produced films, I’ve always loved the turtle action in them. So the fact that this one does the right thing and focuses on the titular characters versus April O’Neil, is already a massive win in my book. That’s what I want in a turtle movie and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has that in spades. And while there’s certainly a degree of origin story present, it mostly serves to reintroduce the public to this gang of green teens versus treading old ground.
One of the most brilliant decisions that the filmmakers make is casting actual teenagers as the Turtles. This already feels like a massive improvement over the near 30-somethings we’re used to getting. They actually feel like teenagers without being dreadfully annoying. The voice acting as well as the writing for each of the teens feels spot on. These aren’t the fully formed versions that we’ve seen in the past, and so they’re still developing some of those traits that would grow to become staples of the character ie. the leadership of Leo. I was a little trepidatious with the change to April O’Neil from an established reporter to an anxious high schooler, but it mostly works. Her connection with the Turtles is beautifully done.
My favorite arc of the story though is Jackie Chan‘s Master Splinter. Past iterations really settle on having him be a wise old man who occasionally cracks jokes. But here they are able to put him in an interesting place that allows him to grow as a character. They finally acknowledge that Splinter doesn’t always know what’s best for the boys. I particularly liked how much he saw of himself in Superfly (Ice Cube), who is another standout. He brings so much energy to the role and sounds like he’s having a blast doing it. When you look at the supporting cast, it’s not surprising there are so many funny side characters. Paul Rudd, John Cena, and Natasia Demetriou all voice various mutants, which allow for what may have been forgotten moments to really leave an impression.
It’s easy to compare the animation to that of Into the Spiderverse but I think it does a good enough job of differentiating itself from those films. Mutant Mayhem is gorgeous and you could stop nearly every shot and use it as a screensaver. There’s a getaway sequence that is a real highlight. And I feel as though the writers absolutely stuffed the film full of references to all sorts of past Turtles’ outings. So unless you count yourself as a fan, you may not get as much out of these moments. Still, I’d say the film does a good job of providing funny moments throughout.
I will say though: I’m not entirely sure how this plays for kids. Most of the children in the screening I was at, seemed mostly disinterested in the film. Whether that’s the slow pacing or the fact that they just didn’t have an investment in the characters, it was a bit alarming given a lot of the box office is expected from families. But I know as a thirty-something nerd who grew up on Turtles, I found myself laughing and having a grand ole time. I can’t wait to see where they go with this and what other characters they bring in. While Shredder is certainly a given, I’m hoping Bebop and Rocksteady are able to take on a more villainous role. All I know is I’m ready for more Turtles!

2023-08-16 02:02:00+00:00,‘TMNT: Mutant Mayhem’ retelling movie review,"With intricate designs and a fun vibe to match the compelling story, ‘Mutant Mayhem’ is a mark of pride in the TMNT universe.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series is not for the faint of heart: notoriously long-winded and complicated, reboots that produce complex (but often refreshing) reimaginations of the characters and numerous antagonists that easily go from mutant of the week to villain of the year. Time after time after time, live-action adaptations of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have almost given me nightmares from how ugly they were.
Nightmares aside, I was interested when Seth Rogen (“The Boys”) took the reins of the franchise and promised fans the animated movie of a lifetime. I, as an avid fan of more modern TMNT content like the 2012 and 2018 series, walked into the theater praying not to be disappointed, and my prayers were answered. With a genius cast, wonderful visuals and a great new take on the origin story of the heroes in a half shell, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is one of the best animated movies of this year.
First and foremost, the movie’s animation style is the most captivating part of this entire film, showing dedicated line art and a neon-noir aesthetic often found in urban settings. The unique style of the movie focuses on color and lighting contrast, as the blocky settings and powerful palette make the film stand out from the rest. The character designs are also cartoonish yet intricate, having an elaborate and exaggerated outline of misshapen body parts. This is highlighted by the sheer creativity in the depiction of several classic TMNT mutants, from the interpretation that the mutants all formed at the same time to the ridiculously creative designs of even the most minor villains. From Michelangelo’s (Shamon Brown Jr., “The Chi”) football-shaped head to Superfly’s (Ice Cube, “Straight Outta Compton”) many-legged build to Leatherhead’s (Rose Byrne, “Insidious”) Australian crocodile nature, every individual has their own idiosyncrasies that make up who they are. And don’t even get me started on the adorable yet absolutely goopy turtle tots, which are hilariously grotesque and yet the cutest and most squishable baby turtles one could imagine.
And of course, the new changes to the TMNT’s universe are intriguing and make for a wonderful story. The changes in the origins of the ooze and its effect on humans, Baxter Stockman’s story and how mutants ultimately interact with the Turtles is more than enough to make for another article in and of itself, but the dynamics among the brothers are ultimately about the same as usual. Unlike most recent iterations where Donatello (Micah Abbey, “Cousins for Life”) particularly has a crush on April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri, “Abbott Elementary”), this time Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu, “The Amazing World of Gumball”) is the one trying to romance her. It’s a refreshing take on Leonardo’s traditionally all-work-no-play personality, where as much as he tries to take after their adopted rat mutant father, Splinter (Jackie Chan, “Rush Hour”), even he is not immune to stereotypical teenage wiles. And similarly to the most recent TMNT iteration “Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” April O’Neil is just a Black high schooler interested in journalism who happens to have her world collide with the Turtles. Not only does her closeness in age to the Turtles make her seem like a more relatable character throughout, but it also helps the audience truly feel like this is a teen-oriented movie rather than adult problems with teenage faces slapped over them. Another incredible thing about the film is that it absolves itself from the Smurfette Principle by adding another strong female character, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph, “Bridesmaids”) into the mix, showing both women’s rights and women’s wrongs.
Of course, everything else goes as one would expect: Raph (Brady Noon, “Good Boys”) has anger issues that he “works on,” Donnie has every nerd stereotype known to man associated with him and Mikey is the chillest turtle mutant one could ever meet. Even so, the new energy that the cast brings into this TMNT iteration was electrifying, leading this movie to possibly have one of the best TMNT casts yet. Especially due to Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and Seth Rogen allowing the main four to record together and improvise, leading to major script changes that allowed for much better chemistry between the characters. This, along with the wonderful East Coast hip-hop soundtrack, provide a fun and exhilarating experience throughout the movie.
Even with all of these amazing factors, there have been a few common complaints. For example, some have commented on the cringe that follows when writing teenage slang into a movie. It’s not great to hear the words “rizz” and “sus” used outside the context of one’s friends, but the realistic depiction of how one would expect a teenager around 16 years old to act is something that brings a sense of naivety and lovability to the characters (again, if it’s something a teenager wouldn’t say, then the literal teenagers improvising those lines probably would not have said it). It shows just how much everything they do is with the intention of living their lives to the fullest, trying to bring change however they can conceive it.
Another one of the most significant new additions is the origin story for Splinter and the other mutants, along with how their stories are mirrored as they come together. Splinter and Superfly are explicitly shown to be foils of one another, with both of them caring for nothing but what the ooze gave them when they were mutated. Both had a family, a people to call their own when humanity refused to accept them. But while Superfly sought revenge, Splinter sought safety — he felt less of a need to hurt others in a world that wanted to hurt everything he cared for, deciding to do everything to protect himself instead. The opposing ideals of fight and flight, hurting or being hurt, seemed to be the only two options in such a black-and-white world. However, the Turtles show that there’s a third option of knowing the risks of the human world but choosing to attempt to live their lives as normal teenagers anyways.
“Mutant Mayhem” is an incredibly fun movie with amazing comic-book-like visuals to match. I rarely truly have fun watching a movie, and yet I was actively shaking my friends and laughing my head off as I watched this movie for the first time. They redefine the teenage experience to be something to enjoy and look out for, something to appreciate and strive for, and it was more than refreshing to see. There should be more fun movies back in the theater, and I’m even more excited for the post-credits scene promising another genius movie following this iteration of our four favorite turtles.

,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been a pretty consistent part of the pop culture landscape since Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s scrappy self-published comic became a sensation in the mid-1980s, spawning an iconic animated series and a popular toy line. In the years since, that initial spark of creativity has inspired several distinct animated universes, two live-action film series, a bevy of toys, multiple video games, mountains of comics, and at least one rock music tour.
With all of that in mind, we’re getting a brand new version of the plucky amphibian heroes in the form of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which looks to stoke the fires of 1980s nostalgia and introduce the Turtles to a new generation. If the previews released so far are anything to go by, the film appears to strike the right chords for older TMNT fans while also appealing to their children and – in some cases – grandchildren. Let’s head to the sewers and dredge up everything we know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
The Mutagen Strikes Again

Starting afresh – as opposed to continuing one of the existing film or TV continuities – the film sees the Turtles, after years of seclusion and training, making their way to the surface in the hopes of being embraced by humanity. Befriending April O’Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), the team takes on a reclusive crime syndicate to keep the streets and sewers safe. And, maybe, they’ll find the acceptance they crave along the way.
Some fans may notice the absence of certain details – notably the Foot Clan and the ever-present Turtles nemesis Shredder – but the presence of characters like Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena) suggests those TMNT staples will appear in due course. See also: Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who often appears in Turtles stories as a press-ganged scientist aiding the Foot in the creation of their own mutants. Although, just as often, he willingly helps as it furthers his own aims and research in mutation.
And, as it happens, other mutants will quickly become a cause of concern for the Turtles. Will they be friends or foes? Considering the film is subtitled Mutant Mayhem, expect that question to drive some of the action.
The Sewers and the Streets

Naturally enough, the Turtles inhabit New York. But judging from our first glimpses at the film, it is a stylized New York one might expect Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Miles Morales to visit. Indeed, the art direction was one of the big appeals for long-time fans when a teaser first arrived in March. Distinct from previous iterations of the Turtles, it also feels like a natural path for the comic book-inspired film.
Beyond that, the swift introduction of alien worlds (and aliens) in the original Eastman and Laird comics and the first animated series means there is always room for the Turtles to visit locations less grounded than Manhattan.
Of Turtles And Mutants

Eschewing the typical pattern for the Turtles voice cast – or even long-time voice actors like Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, or Greg Cipes – the film will feature four actual teenagers in the lead roles. The Walking Dead: World Beyond‘s Nicolas Cantu leads as Leonardo, the most dedicated of Master Splinter’s pupils to their training and goals. Micah Abbey lends his voice to generally tech-smart Donatello. Brady Noon of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers brings the attitude as a new Raphael, while Shamon Brown Jr. parties it up as Michelangelo.
Of course, we’re assuming the personalities of the Turtles will remain intact in Mutant Mayhem, but as seen in the teaser trailer, casting a group of young men leads to a noticeably different interpretation of the characters – vocally, at least. Additionally, the group recorded their dialogue together, offering a chance for more improvisation and a greater sense of camaraderie, which we clearly see in the scene of the Turtles goofing off in the teaser.
Beyond the four leads, the film is outfitted with a surprising number of familiar names – many of them playing surprising character pulls from Turtles history. Starting with the most recognizable characters, The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri lends her voice to this version of April O’Neil. The character has had many permutations over the years, from TV anchor to budding reporter to straight-up ninja, so anything is possible with Edebiri and her take on the Turtles’ most constant friend. Jackie Chan takes on the role of Master Splinter, the boys’ sensei and adoptive father.

As mentioned above, the recognizable bad guys include Bebop and Rocksteady, voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena, respectively, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman. Will the latter end up a fly by the end of the film? Time will tell.
Paul Rudd offers his talents as Mondo Gecko, the radical skateboarding lizard who has been part of TMNT lore since 1989. Rose Byrne plays Leatherhead, a mutant alligator who has been both friend and foe to the Turtles over the years. Post Malone voices Ray Fillet, a character who first appeared in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series as “Man-Ray” but soon made his way to the action figure aisles under his subsequent moniker. Hannibal Buress becomes Genghis Frog, one of the original toy line’s attempts at beating imitators to the punch with a group known as the Punk Frogs. Natasia Demetriou takes on Wingnut, a humanoid bat who is sometimes an alien, a mutant, a would-be superhero, or a terrorist, depending on the era and series. Maya Rudolph is Cynthia Utrom – a character who might seem new for the film, but with a last name that fans will certainly recognize and that suggests something very specific about who she might truly be.

And finally, Ice Cube is Superfly, a new addition to the group of mutants to be featured in the film, who is revealed to be the primary villain in the latest trailer. Taking a page out of X-Men nemesis Magneto’s playbook, Superfly asserts that humans will never accept mutants like him and his cohorts, so he’s out to conquer mankind and put mutants in charge. Bebop, Rocksteady, and the others accordingly appear to be on his side.
While all the other mutants certainly pull at the nostalgia strings, the new direction in casting the Turtles voices may be the key thing that opens the characters up to a new generation of fans.

The film is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs The Machines – which he also wrote – and a staff writer on Gravity Falls and Disenchantment. Joining him as co-director is Kyler Spears, who also worked on Mitchells as a storyboard artist; considering their past collaboration, it’s no surprise that Mutant Mayhem feels like the next step in the evolution of the visual style we saw in Mitchells. Rowe also wrote Mutant Mayhem in conjunction with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit.
According to Rogen, part of the intent is to lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the title more heavily than in past iterations, citing movies like Stand By Me as inspiration. Based on the teaser, it definitely appears his intent made it to the finished product.
Rogen and Goldberg serve as producers with Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean as executive producers. Other crew include procution designer Yashar Kassai, character designer James A. Castillo, production supervisor Derek Manzella, and post-production supervisor Ryan Price.

The footage kicked off with a clip IGN premiered last week in which the Turtles suit up before preparing to stealthily go grocery shopping. Here's that clip, in case you missed it:

From there, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael enter a bodega and try to dodge security cameras while shoplifting supplies and food. Job done, the Turtles hitch a ride back to Manhattan on a truck roof. A news report displayed on an enormous screen reveals crime is rising under a mastermind known as Superfly.
The Turtles watch an outdoor screening of 1980s coming of age classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which is live-action while the audience is animated. “Maybe one day everyone will love us like they love Ferris Bueller,” one Turtle laments. The quartet wistfully stare at the movie screen and audience before they escape into the sewers.
The Turtles try to sneak home but a wide-awake Splinter catches them. Of course, Leo owns up to their late night shenanigans. You can see a short clip of this scene in the video below:

Splinter, being Splinter, admonishes the Turtles for risking interaction with humans. Splinter recounts his origin to teach them a valuable lesson about humans. He says humans are the worst - his best friend was a cockroach who was stepped on. We then see Splinter eat his cockroach friend. What’s a rat going to do?
Splinter discovers four adorable baby turtles in the sewer in the green ooze fans know all too well. They transform. Splinter’s transformation is like body horror. Splinter raises the toddler turtles via an adorable montage. We see bath time, all the Turtles sleeping in Splinter’s bed, and their curiosity about the outside world even as kids. Enamoured, Splinter grants the Turtles a trip to the human world.
In Times Square, Splinter is carrying the kids when a woman bumps into him. Soon the whole crowd freaks out and chase Splinter and the Turtles off. They’re almost run over by vehicles as they make their escape. After the incident, Splinter swears to protect the Turtles, training them during a typical martial arts movie montage.
We shift back to the present, when Splinter grounds the Turtles for a month. They’re unhappy, as you’d expect. Donnie asks Leo if it was worth it, which saddens him. We see the Turtles lying in their bads wondering what they’d do if they were normal. They could go to the prom, they suggest, before discounting the possibility.
Now we’re out in NYC at dusk. A human “road crew” working for Superfly pulls a heist on an armored truck and steals what was inside. Police chase after the road crew’s truck. Suddenly, a winged creature seizes the truck and flies off with it to a hidden location. Turns out the creature is Superfly, who we presume eats the crew. We see what was stolen: a mysterious radioactive device.
We cut to Maya Rudolph’s character who, at a headquarters, dishes out tracking units to vehicles to try to catch up to Superfly. The Turtles, meanwhile, are on a rooftop. Donnie is holding a watermelon over his head so the brothers can enjoy a spot of target practice. The Turtles hear a crash below, caused by an errant ninja star. The crash involved a scooter belonging to… April! Someone steals the scooter - Leo insists he retrieve it for this beautiful and charming human woman. The turtles leap into action and chase the thief back to a chop shop.
The Turtles, who have never been in a real fight before, draw their weapons. Mikey gets a ninja star in his leg before the human thieves initiate a brawl. The Turtles use whatever they can to fight. “Go, Ninja, Go!” plays at one point. The fight trashes the chop shop.
Eventually, the Turtles emerge victorious and find April’s scooter. When April walks in the Turtles hide in the shadows. April says they’re “sus” for doing so. Slowly, the Turtles enter the light. April thinks they’re human crime fighters in turtle costumes. “Can we explain this over pizza?” one Turtle says. “How do you feel about pepperoni?” April replies. “I didn’t think it would get this far,” Donnie says.
That’s the end of the footage! The panel also saw TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman deliver a special announcement: Nickelodeon and Paramount have secured the rights to run the original series starting next year.
We end with another clip from Mutant Mayhem. We see April and the Turtles in a stakeout of a meeting of the mutants. “I’m going to win a daytime Emmy,” April says to herself as she records the meeting on her phone.
Superfly confronts the Turtles. “I can’t believe there are other mutants like us,” Mikey says. Superfly says the same ooze that made the Turtles made Superfly and his crew, and reveals his “dad”, Baxter Stockman, is the one who dumped the ooze in the sewer. Mondo Gecko hugs the Turtles. “I’m a hugger,” he says. They go on about liking each other’s vibe.
In another clip, we see the Turtles are very much not down with Superfly’s plan to kill all the humans.
That’s it for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem footage shown at San Diego Comic-Con. The movie comes out in cinemas August 2, 2023.

2023-07-24 07:47:15-07:00,Xbox's new Ninja Turtles controllers smell just like pizza,Microsoft is giving away pizza-scented Xbox controllers to promote Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.,"Microsoft and Paramount Pictures are giving away Xbox controllers based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which they are proudly proclaiming are “the world’s first pizza-scented Xbox controllers.”
This is not the first time Microsoft and Paramount created weird Xbox controllers to give away in a sweepstakes. Its fuzzy Sonic and Knuckles controllers released around Sonic the Hedgehog 2 also gained a lot of attention in February 2022. Still, there’s never been an Xbox controller quite like this. Four controllers exist, which are an oozy green, have art of one of the turtles on it, and have the top of a pizza sticking out of the back. According to Microsoft, that is what is actually pizza-scented.
“Satisfy your hunger for kicking butt with the world’s first ever pizza-scented controller,” Microsoft says in an Xbox Wire post about the controller. “Designed to deliver the smell of the Turtles’ beloved meal to your game time, these exclusive Xbox Wireless Controllers come with a built-in scent diffuser shaped like a slice of delicious New York ‘za.” That’s a pretty fancy way to say you’ve made a controller that smells weird and will continue to smell even weirder as time goes on. They don’t even specify what kind of pizza it smells like!

To have a chance to nab one of these controllers, people need to follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter (or X, as it’s being rebranded to) and retweet (re-X?) a tweet (an X, I hate this) that the account will eventually post before August 13. What you do after you get one of these is on you.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hits theaters on August 2.

,"New movies to see this weekend: Watch 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,' bite into 'Meg 2'","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back in ""Mutant Mayhem,"" Jason Statham stars in ""Meg 2"" and more new movies in theaters or streaming this weekend.","Are you more into turtle power or prehistoric sharks?
This weekend, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back on the big screen in an animated comedy headed up by Seth Rogen. The heroes in a half shell are joined by action-movie guru Jason Statham, who's tussling with toothy marauders in a sequel to 2018's ""The Meg."" Oscar winner Casey Affleck plays a singer-songwriter in a true-life music drama and if you have fond memories of 2000s teen TV dramas, there's a redo of ""The River Wild"" starring real-life couple Leighton Meester (""Gossip Girl"") and Adam Brody (""The O.C."").
Here's a guide to new movies that will satisfy every cinematic taste, plus some noteworthy theatrical films making their streaming and on-demand debuts this weekend:
If you and your kids need a superhero fix: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'
Even if you didn't grow up a ""TMNT"" nerd, ""Mutant Mayhem"" is a pleasantly chaotic animated adventure that brilliantly casts actual teenagers as the four color-coded main characters. Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey snarf down pizza, dream of going to high school but have to save New York City when a mutated housefly named Superfly (voiced by Ice Cube) and his animal army want to take over the world.
Where to watch: In theaters
Review:'Mutant Mayhem' is the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie we always dreamed of
If you want to see Jason Statham battle ginormous sharks: 'Meg 2: The Trench'
British director Ben Wheatley boasts an eclectic resume (genre-bending horror flick ""Kill List,"" Hitchcock remake ""Rebecca"") that grows even more varied with his first huge Hollywood action movie. The sci-fi seafaring sequel returns Statham as a rescue diver who survived an encounter with a supposedly extinct megalodon in the first movie and now has to face a trio of finned foes, other sea monsters and environmental bad guys.
Where to watch: In theaters
Meet the megalodon:What you need to know about the shark star of 'Meg 2: The Trench'
If you were a big fan of 'Joy Ride': 'Shortcomings'
Randall Park's directorial debut explores identity and Asian American representation, with Justin H. Min starring as a Bay Area arthouse theater manager suffering from arrested development. His girlfriend (Ally Maki) moves to New York, leaving him to sulk with lesbian best friend Alice (Sherry Cola) and get his life in order. The casting lifts the movie, with Min uncannily good at being an insufferable jerk and ""Joy Ride"" breakout Cola an absolute hoot.
Where to watch: In theaters
If you dig real-life music stories: 'Dreamin' Wild'
Affleck stars in this true-life, not-so-overnight success story as singer-songwriter Donnie Emerson, who gets a second chance at stardom when an album made with his brother Joe (Walton Goggins) as teens in the '70s becomes a word-of-mouth sensation three decades later. It's a well-acted musical drama that intriguingly explores a man coming to grips with his artistic past and present.
Where to watch: In theaters
If you miss Jon Hamm in 'Mad Men': 'Corner Office'
An engaging combo of ""Office Space"" and ""Black Mirror,"" the absurdist comedy stars Jon Hamm as a newly hired corporate drone who doesn't get along with his messy cubicle mate (Danny Pudi). Hamm's melancholic loner with a mop mustache discovers a posh secret room on his floor that becomes a much-needed sanctuary where he can get some work done, but its existence creates a divisive wedge between him and his co-workers.
Where to watch: In theaters and on Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon, Google Play
If you enjoy seeing wedding days go bloody wrong: 'Til Death Do Us Part'
It's too bad they went with that title, especially since ""Bride Hard"" was right there. Former ballerina Natalie Burn shows off all sorts of martial arts moves as a woman who leaves her groom at the altar and then has to survive a night of hell when the cunning best man (Cam Gigandet) and a violent pack of groomsmen try to bring her back. There's a big mystery that unfurls but it just muddies up a B-movie with a nifty premise and some killer action.
Where to watch: In theaters
If you're a fan of overwrought Lifetime dramas: 'What Comes Around'
Grace Van Dien (""Stranger Things"") plays a teenager who communicates online with an older man (Kyle Gallner) and on her 17th birthday, she's found he's traveled thousands of miles and suddenly shown up at her doorstep. Naturally, the girl's mom (Summer Phoenix) is not pleased but just as it seems like an overly creepy afterschool special, the movie pulls off an interesting plot twist that at least keeps the uninspired melodrama somewhat watchable.
Where to watch: In theaters and on Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon
If you want more of the real story behind 'Oppenheimer': 'A Compassionate Spy'
One of the more intriguing subplot threads in ""Oppenheimer"" involves a Russian mole in the Manhattan Project, and that person – physicist Ted Hall – is the subject of this riveting documentary by Steve James (""Hoop Dreams""). Hall was hired at 18 to help develop the atomic bomb, and the film reveals the understandable reason why he worked with Soviet spies and the stressful years spent after World War II keeping the secret.
Where to watch: In theaters and on Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon, Google Play
If you're curious to see a remake no one asked for: 'River Wild'
Meester stars as the sister of a river guide (Taran Killam) who goes on a white-water rafting jaunt with a small group – including their ex-con childhood friend (Brody) – and the situation goes from tragic and murderous to downright ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and just watch the OG Kevin Bacon/Meryl Streep 1994 thriller instead.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe and voice cast discuss what makes this film, and version of the turtles, so unique.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem offers a unique look. It also features real teenage voice for the turtles for the first time ever. This helps to set it apart from previous iterations of the well loved franchise.
Note: This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike.
Mama’s Geeky caught up with the director of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem as well as the voice cast to talk about the new film. They revealed their feelings on the unique animation style that is used to bring Mutant Mayhem to life.
Participating Talent:
Ayo Edebiri (April O’Neil)
Nicolas Cantu (Leonardo)
Brady Noon (Raphael)
Micah Abbey (Donatello)
Shamon Brown Jr. (Michelangelo)
Director Jeff Rowe
The Unique Animation Style Of Mutant Mayhem
Ayo Edebiri: I think the art and the animation in this movie is just so beautiful, and specific, and evocative. I felt like, as the person who gets to voice April, I got so much from just looking at her. I felt a lot of tenderness also, because I feel like she looks like a real human being. I feel like that is really important and cool. And it’s also important, cool, because it’s like, it’s not a big deal, you know?
Shamon Brown Jr.: I think the first time I saw the look, the head was a bit more squished than it is. So to see it a bit more poof, that was definitely a relief. But just the animation art style of it just being so unique, and the first time for the turtles being this way. The way we’re doing it, the way it looks with our voices and the team behind it; it’s just an amazing thing to see. Seeing the finished product is beautiful, honestly.
Micah Abbey: Yeah, it’s just really cool. I think it’s so unique. I think that’s what people are gonna love the most about it, is just how different it looks. And it adds new energy and a new feel to the whole movie.
Nicolas Cantu: Yeah, it feels great to be a part of this new wave of stylized 3d animation. To join that and do something that’s different. It looks great. I mean, you’re gonna love seeing it on a big screen. It’s incredible. The animation is fluid, the action scenes are boarded really well. It’s a fun movie.
Brady Noon: I think the color, too, speaks well. It’s so vibrant and lively. It’s hard not to stay attentive, you know what I mean? So, I mean, it’s just a lot of fun. There’s a lot of mutants and a lot of mayhem.
Director Jeff Rowe: I think the tendency in the past decade or so, when you reinvent characters, is to cover them in gear, like black tactical equipment and we’re like, that’s not what I love about the Ninja Turtles. When I was a kid, they had same color armbands and headbands. So we took these elements from the classic designs, and then put them on these characters that the biggest mission was to make them look authentically teenage. They’re kind of lanky, they’re awkward in their bodies. They don’t know how to carry themselves. They’re still growing, and just grounding it in that realism.

,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' Interview: Ice Cube,"Moviefone speaks with Ice Cube about 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.' It's like joining a championship franchise, he said of appearing in the fi","Opening in theaters on August 2nd is the new computer-animated superhero film ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,’ which was written and produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (‘Superbad’), and directed by Jeff Rowe (‘The Mitchells vs. the Machines’).
What is the plot of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'?
After years of being sheltered from the human world, the four Turtle brothers (Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon) set out on a quest to be accepted as normal teenagers by the people of New York City through acts of heroism. With the aid of their new friend April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the brothers go on a hunt for a mysterious crime syndicate, but trouble arises when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
Who is in the cast of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'?
Moviefone recently had the pleasure of speaking with actor and musician Ice Cube about his work in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,’ joining the popular franchise, his love for the Turtles, playing the villain Superfly, the recording process and bonding with his co-stars.
You can read the full interview below or click on the video player above to watch our interview with Ice Cube, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and director Jeff Rowe.
Moviefone: To begin with, were you a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles before joining this project and what does it mean to you to be a part of this franchise?
Ice Cube: Oh, yeah, a big fan. I’ve been checking them out since the '80s and I took my kids to the movies and dealt with the lunch pails, the bedspreads, the action figures and all that. Remember when Kevin Durant went to the Warriors and they was already champs? It's kind of like that. It's like joining a championship franchise and getting a chance to make a difference. So, it was a dream come true for any actor.
MF: How would you describe Superfly in your own words and was it challenging finding the character’s voice?
IC: Superfly is the King of New York. Everything that's bad, you've got to run through him. You've got to check in, for sure. But he has a heart. He don't want to be an ugly Superfly. He wants friends. He wants acceptance. He just wants people to like him. He just wants to go to happy hour and eat his bowl of sugar and smoke a cigar, man. You know what I mean? It's one of those things where he's a guy you can understand, and if you don't give him that, he tears up New York.
MF: I understand for this film, the recording process was done differently than on other animated movies as you actually got to work with the other actors you were performing with. Can you talk about that process and what was that like for you?
IC: It seemed like all animation should be done this way. You get a different kind of performance when you're in the room with other actors who can match your timing, and you guys can kind of bounce off each other. It's why the film feels so real and natural, and it doesn't feel like the standard animation where you can tell somebody's in a pristine studio, and they're by themselves, and they're trying to make it sound like they're part of a group. This is the way to do it.
MF: Finally, did that process allow you to bond with the four actors playing the Turtles, and what was it like for you working with them?
IC: Very cool. All of them have great energy. All of them have great voices. When you think of animation, you think of people with amazing voices. How do you have a voice that's perfect for a cartoon, especially when they're young? I'm always amazed at these perfect voices that are chosen in animation, not just ‘Ninja Turtles,’ but most animation, they find the people with the most unique sounding voices that's usually perfect. So, I like listening to them talk.

,Why Seth Rogen is drawn to everything that's not Marvel and DC,Noted comic book fan Seth Rogen is revealing why he's drawn to 'everything that is not Marvel and DC.',"Actor, producer, and self-proclaimed ""permanent teenager"" Seth Rogen has helped bring numerous comic books to the big and small screens, including The Boys, Preacher, Invincible, and the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
But at a time when big-budget superhero stories are dominating Hollywood, Rogen is opening up about why he's specifically drawn to indie comics material — or ""everything that is not Marvel and DC.""
In a recent interview with Polygon, Rogen said he approaches making movies and TV like a kid in a comic book shop. ""This idea of browsing and not having things fed to you — as I think people feel we are now when it comes to entertainment — but instead entering the fair market of entertainment and just wandering around and seeing what catches your eye,"" he said.

As for what's turned him off about the idea of working with juggernauts like Marvel and DC, he said, ""Honestly, probably fear."" He added that he and longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg ""have a pretty specific way we work.""
Noting that ""There are a lot of Marvel things I love,"" Rogen expressed apprehension about how he and Goldberg would ""plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with?""
As producers on Mutant Mayhem, ""We dictated the system and we dictated the process in a lot of ways,"" Rogen said. ""And that's what's also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we've done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else's infrastructure and process. We're control freaks!""
Rogen has previously acknowledged that there's room for all kinds of comic book stories. Earlier this year he told Total Film, ""truthfully, without Marvel, The Boys wouldn't exist or be interesting. I'm aware of that. I think if it was only Marvel, it would be bad. But I think it isn't — clearly.""

2023-07-20 14:00:00+00:00,How Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Puts a Fresh Spin on the Franchise,"Actual teenagers and a fresh, wild art style mark a new era for the classic franchise in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","This appreciation dripped into the team’s approach to Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen says the filmmakers strove to keep what was drafted in the concept art. “I’ve been through this process so many times where you see the concept art and by the time you’re making the movie, it has lost all of its energy. That did not happen here,” he reveals. “It was asymmetrical and imperfect. I remember the first time seeing it dimensionalized, and it blew my mind.”
The Turtles in the Room
The story and style of Mutant Mayhem boast teenage vigor, but to hear adults voicing the core team would betray all that the filmmakers envisioned. So it was critical that, for the first time ever, the Ninja Turtles are played by actual teenagers. “Part of the spirit we were trying to capture was to make the movie fun, like kids playing with toys,” says Rogen, revealing that even his adult co-stars had fun playing off each other IRL. “That was something we talked about. How do we make it feel fun and silly? This reckless weirdness that almost every kid playing with their toys has?”
Actors Nicolas Cantu (The Walking Dead: World Beyond), Brady Noon (Good Boys), Shamon Brown Jr. (The Chi), and Micah Abbey (Grey’s Anatomy) voice Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, respectively. In an unusual turn for any major animation project, Mutant Mayhem recorded the cast in-person, together, allowing them to improvise lines. The goal was to capture the authenticity of teens hanging out—something that no adult screenwriter can replicate in Final Draft.
Casting was “arduous,” according to Rogen. Citing his own experiences in voiceover work, Rogen strove to mitigate factors that can sometimes leave animation projects feeling inauthentic. “A recurring frustration I have is that you never perform with the other actors,” he says. “The magic of our work that people like is a result of being in the moment and playing off each other. That energy was important to capture. So we went through painstaking lengths to make sure that as much as possible, they all recorded together.”
Fittingly, this approach to recording enabled the filmmakers to see their adolescent stars slowly become their characters—and vice versa. “They’re very much [acting like] themselves,” Rowe says. “So much of the dialogue is just things they said to each other.
I cannot think of another animated film at this scale that’s worked that way, in casting kids and letting them be their authentic selves. We wanted these characters to be complex and feel like people you knew.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1uZXctc3Bpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-18 13:00:00+00:00,Toy Review: TMNT Mutant Mayhem Basic Turtles by Playmates,"The Mutant Mayhem basic Turtles give the kids a lot of bang for their buck, with a price point somehow still under ten dollars.","Playmates take a lot of heat from collectors.
Much of the ire stems from the fact that their action figures have remained essentially unchanged since the ’90s. They have the same levels of sculpt and articulation, and the same lack of internal scale. Example: Krang’s Robot Body can be anything from a deluxe giant to a turtle-sized figure.
But these criticisms miss the point. Playmates has managed to sell fully poseable, fully accessorized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures that a kid can buy for under $10 (plus tax, of course) since the ’80s. With the new Mutant Mayhem basic Turtles for the upcoming animated movie, they’ve done so and upped the sculpt and paint games. You might be lucky to find them for $10 still, but it’s not impossible.
Turtle Boyz II Men
For the new movie, the foursome come in all new sculpts. Each figure includes a baby turtle, signature weapons with colored handles (except Don’s staff; he makes up for that with an extra accessory of headphones), and a weapons rack with pop-out bonus weapons all in one color.
The single-color aspect is a little gross when we’re talking pizza slices. Then again, this is New York — maybe some gourmet place makes expensive metallic pizzas with edible silver and squid ink. Your imagination, your rules.
If you want the weapons to stay attached to the rack “unpopped,” take extra care to cuts the ties that hold it in the package. Pulling the rack out too abruptly may pull one of the weapons off.
That aside, they lie on the posts pretty well after being popped or cut off.
The gang do all include sheaths for their primary weapons. But in a slight change, Mikey’s are on his back. This is because he now has a fanny pack on his front, containing what seem to be a non-removable smartphone. (His glasses are removable, if you’re an older-school fan who hates that look.)
Turtles ‘N’ Timely
These Turtles draw on what came before. With Donnie now having glasses in many incarnations, that’s what this one has too. Likewise, Raph wear a bandana and be bulkier and more battle scarred than the rest, which also carries over. Mike looks a little goofy, as the party dude. Leo’s serious but calm, with head ties fluttering in the wind. To fit the aesthetic of them all being actual teenagers who look like teenagers, they’re thinner and not full adult-muscle size.
Packaging includes tiny file cards, containing factoids like Raph wanting to be an MMA fighter (Huh? Isn’t he one, unofficially?)
The articulation on these is an interesting mix. Cut joints at the wrists and ankles, true ball neck, disc-and-pin shoulders, knees, and hips. But the hips are unusual — normally, the disc joint would go side-to-side on the legs, but for these, they go back to front, allowing the gang to sit down and bend forward much more easily without going bow-legged.
The outlined eyes and teeth make for a nice cartoon-y look, and the sculpt feels a little rough, like a woodcut or unique animated style. These guys do look like they stepped out of a cartoon, which is the idea. And while they may be tougher to balance than some, you can achieve some contorted action poses with a bit of patience and finding the sweet spot.
Reptilian Scales
In case you’re wondering, they play reasonably well with the Loyal Subjects TMNT figures, scale-wise.
As far as 6-inch figures, it again depends how big you think the Turtles are, as they have varied a lot across many media.
Right as this review was about to publish, Playmates sent over a couple of the 12-inch Turtles to compare. Oddly, their leg disc-and-pin joints do go side-to-side. And they lack elbow joints completely. That aside, they’re similar, and have even more of a wood-carved feel. It keeps them visually distinct from previous toys. And at under $20, also a great deal, with sheathable primary weapons.
More detailed collectibles might add more of a wash, or even more hidden articulation, but these really are quite impressive for Playmates, with higher sculpt quality than usual and good articulation at the price. Anyone looking to casually pick up a set of the foursome could pay a lot more for NECA iterations, or get a fun, solid set for $40 and change.

2023-08-05 15:28:37+00:00,"Movie review: ‘Mutant Mayhem’ a fresh, authentic take on the ninja turtles","The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.","Radioactive ooze generated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” has helped birth “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the new animated feature about everyone’s favorite rambunctious, pizza-loving reptiles. Directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears showcase the turtles in a way we’ve never seen them before, utilizing a blend of 3D and 2D animation to create a unique, rough-hewn (on purpose) style that suggests children’s book illustrations blended with teenage sketchbooks.
That edgy look is paired with a script that’s funny and fresh, a soundtrack filled with classic New York hip-hop, and a stunning industrial score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
It’s clear that Rowe, Spears and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (who also produced the film), Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit and Brendan O’Brien, have a deep love and nostalgia for these lovable ‘80s relics, who were ubiquitous in the childhoods of older millennials. These sewer-dwelling rapscallions, raised and trained by a rat named Splinter, were born on the pages of a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. There were toys, a memorable Saturday morning cartoon, and three live-action movies back in the 1990s (who could forget the refrain sung by Vanilla Ice: “go ninja, go ninja, go!”). But the less said about the film adaptations in the 2010s, the better.
‘Mutant Mayhem’ is both a new direction for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a return to the past, symbolically, locating the material in the land of teenage imagination, memory, nostalgia and emotion. The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.
The color palette is dark with pops of neon, giving it an early ‘90s look. Sprinkled throughout are video clips that nod to the cultural touchstones of the creators: snippets of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” a salute to John Hughes, to whose vision of American high school the teen turtles cling, and instructional karate training videos, which is how Splinter (Jackie Chan) teaches his young turtle sons to defend themselves against the terrifying outside world.
The creators get back to basics with the story, focusing on the question of fathers and sons, mutants existing within humanity and the universal desire for acceptance. Splinter, a New York City street rat, is already inured to human rejection when he adopts the four adorable turtles covered in radioactive ooze. He raises them in a loving environment, away from the hustle and bustle (and malice) of the city, and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), grow up in a tight-knit quartet, though they long to be part of the world.
On the other hand is supervillain Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who doesn’t hide from humanity, but harbors genocidal impulses toward the people who have deemed his and his mutant brethren unacceptable. He wants to make every creature on earth a mutant, tipping the balance of power away from the humans and toward the mutants, believing it the only way they’ll find their place in the world.
With the help of intrepid reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the turtles decide to stop Superfly in the hopes that if they’re seen as heroes, they’ll be celebrated and integrated into society in order to fulfill their dream of going to high school (they’re teenagers, they’ve got teenage dreams).
The themes are broad and universal but the writing is remarkable — the dialogue feels natural and authentic to the age group, and it’s filled with modern slang and references to pop culture, rap songs, anime, comedy and more. Their desire for community is a resonant message, but it’s expressed in layered dialogue that feels like the way real teens talk to each other, and it’s beautifully performed by the four actors voicing the turtles.
The filmmakers manage to balance the contemporary feel of the writing and innovative visual style with their own nostalgia for childhood cultural touchstones, which makes “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a fascinating and highly entertaining blend of old and new.

,Late-Summer Lightning Round,"Ninja Turtles, Clones, and Creepy Hands","(Composite / Photos: MovieStillsDB / Shutterstock)
Between the striking critical and commercial success of Oppenheimer and Barbie, the visually stylish Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Asteroid City, vibrant and lived-in indie features such as Past Lives and You Hurt My Feelings, and the general sense that audiences are finally tiring of sludgy, CGI sameness as represented by the failures of The Flash, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, it’s been a pretty good summer. So great that I haven’t had time to cover everything I’d like to. As such I’d just like to highlight three solid late-summer movies that deserve a little bit of love if you’ve got a couple hours to spare.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, like Barbie, is a two-hour toy commercial designed to hit the pleasure centers of a nostalgia-addled nation. Unlike Barbie, however, Mutant Mayhem has the decency to never insult the audience by pretending that it doubles as a critique of its advertisement-like nature. Importantly, it also understands exactly what it is and who it’s for: kids who want to see ninja turtle action with the occasional puke gag and adults who find the idea of Ice Cube delivering a sentient, steroidal housefly’s monologues amusing.
The setup will be familiar to anyone aware of any of the many iterations of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: a rat and four baby turtles are exposed to radioactive ooze in the sewers of Manhattan, mutating them into man-sized animals who learn martial arts and love pizza. Tired of living underground, the turtles yearn for the sweet air of freedom, which inevitably brings them into conflict with forces that yearn for their destruction. In this case, that destruction comes in the form of Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who has decided to mutate every animal on earth so as to eliminate humanity.
Share
Produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (among others), who paired previously on raunch-com high school classic Superbad (among others), Mutant Mayhem does a good job of capturing the eternal anxieties of adolescence: fear that the broader world will reject you; the desire to find kindred spirits who accept you for what you are; trying to avoid the wrath of your aging rodent father who has made a home for you and your mutant brothers in the sewers and believes mankind will destroy you if you ever make yourself seen in public. It’s lighthearted, funny, and vaguely absurdist: There’s a joke about an evil corporation “milking” the turtles of their radioactive essence so as to create more mutated monstrosities that winds up in such a literal-minded place I couldn’t help but guffaw at the screen.
Where Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem stands out is less on a scripting level—though, again, it’s pretty funny and moves along nicely—and more on a visual level. Alongside Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Mutant Mayhem is a reminder that the long-running CGI aesthetic we’ve all grown accustomed to—that sort of smooth, elegant fluidity that defines so much of Pixar and DreamWorks—has more or less run its course. The animation in Mutant Mayhem has a sort of designed raggedness to it: dust cloud squiggles that call to mind Charlie Brown’s pal Pigpen exist alongside hyperkinetic action of the sort you might see in an anime feature. It’s polished and crude at the same time, giving the screen an almost tactile sensibility. Director Jeff Rowe and the animators at Mikros Animation deserve every accolade they have coming their way for the look and feel of this movie.

Talk to Me and its success at the box office—it grossed $10 million in its opening last weekend, instantly making it one of the 20 most successful movies ever released by studio A24—is a reminder that one surefire way to strike gold in horror is to have teenagers doing stupid things that invite supernatural doom.
Mia (Sophie Wilde) is a bit of a weirdo and a loner, though she can be forgiven for that given the fact that her mother, Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen), committed suicide not long ago. She ignores her father, choosing instead to spend time with surrogate family Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and Riley (Joe Bird), whose mother Sue (Miranda Otto) has taken a shine to Mia. Mia is fascinated by a viral video craze sweeping her Australian town: while gripping a ceramic hand, saying “talk to me,” and then inviting the invisible spirits summoned into their bodies, kids are getting possessed and doing weird stuff for the delight of their contemporaries.
The obvious metaphor here is drug addiction—during the possessions, those infested by the restless spirits see their pupils dilate to unnatural size and they lose control of their bodily functions; it’s all such a rush that they can’t wait to do it over and over and over again, seemingly oblivious to the dangers of letting limbo-trapped souls inhabit your body—though social media comes in for a fair critique as well. There is also a sense that we’re seeing a playing out of trauma, given Rhea’s suicide and its effects on her family; it’s almost hard to have a horror movie these days without trauma being referenced at some point.
Talk to Me exudes creepiness in large part thanks to its makeup design; the ghosts that wander into the view of the game’s participants seem to be done with largely practical effects, lots of latex and gels and that sort of thing. I’d be curious to read up on how the directorial team of Michael and Danny Philippou managed a couple of the stunts, particularly one in the opening moments that prompted shocked gasps from the patrons in my theater.
What separates Talk to Me from some other entries in this genre is just how unrelentingly cruel it is; there’s a scene about two-thirds of the way through this movie that I won’t spoil except to say that it called to mind the children-in-peril sequences from Hereditary and this year’s Evil Dead Rise. The sequences are brutal; those of you with kids may prefer to skip this one altogether. But that brutality is effective in the same way that The Exorcist’s vulgarity was effective.
Talk to Me has a mild It Follows problem, in the sense that the rules of engagement with the spectral presence at the heart of the film are haphazardly defined and infrequently enforced. I can believe a ceramic hand opens a portal into limbo that allows contact with the damned, but only if that contact works in very precise ways each time. But I’ll forgive this venial mid-movie sin given Talk to Me’s corker of an ending. A great finale will make up for a lot of missteps earlier on.
Teyonah Parris, Jamie Foxx, and John Boyega in They Cloned Tyrone . (Courtesy of Netflix)
They Cloned Tyrone is everything that’s good and bad about Netflix: It’s a weird little indie movie that’s going to wind up getting a much bigger audience than it otherwise might have thanks to the prominence of its placement on that service’s homepage but is probably 20 minutes too long and destined to be buried in the service’s back catalog—rather than living on as a cult classic until a niche Blu-ray distributor resurrects it for mass consumption.
Directed by Juel Taylor, who cowrote with Tony Rettenmaier, you’ll instantly get the tenor of They Cloned Tyrone via the set dressing. In the film’s very first shot, we open on an advertisement of a wide-eyed man gulping down “Somaah! Carbonated Beverage” and pull back to see folks acting foolishly outside of the convenience store on which the poster has been plastered. Combining Nineteen Eighty-Four’s Big Brother—given the locale and clientele, the model is conspicuously white—with the preferred narcotic of Brave New World into one handy image, this sort of subtle commentary on the nature of advertising and consumption persists throughout the picture. It’s there if you can pick up on it.
For instance, you might miss this on first viewing, but there’s a delicate hint at what the film is getting at when Fontaine (John Boyega), Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx), and Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) discover that fried chicken, hair-straightening products, urban churches, and hip hop are being used to control and modify the behavior of black residents. The three of them were merely trying to learn how it was that Fontaine survived being shot six times in a parking lot; instead, they uncovered a vast conspiracy involving mind control and, as the title suggests, cloning. It’s a conspiracy that the villainous enforcer played by Kiefer Sutherland will kill to protect. (Another subtle hint at what’s going on: Sutherland’s character is named Nixon.)
Give a gift membership
There’s something mildly amusing about the conceit of They Cloned Tyrone (or predecessors such as They Live!), namely that we’d need a vast, widespread conspiracy entrenched within our governmental and corporate bodies to seduce any given population into complacency. You can happily count on human nature to do the seduction: We love our simple pleasures and will happily be lulled by them, be they delicious fried food or the narcotized drip of streaming TV at war with sleep itself.
The lack of subtlety works in They Cloned Tyrone’s favor, just as it worked in the favor of They Live! or Pootie Tang or Sorry to Bother You: the over-the-top nature of it all keeps the picture from devolving into self-seriousness. It’s a message movie, yeah, but the movie itself is goofily endearing in a way that lessens the gravity and keeps us from getting weighed down. It helps that the performances are so good throughout; Jamie Foxx is perfect as pimp-past-his-prime Slick Charles. Alongside his recent supporting turn in the underseen God Is a Bullet, it’s a reminder that Foxx has an absolutely electric screen presence.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1cy50aGVidWx3YXJrLmNvbS9wL2xhdGUtc3VtbWVyLW1vdmllLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1yb3VuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 13:00:00+00:00,TMNT director teases that Shredder will appear in future movies,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem co-director Jeff Rowe says he'd be ""100%"" down to make a sequel in new SFX interview","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character Shredder might not be in Mutant Mayhem but he'll definitely show up in future movies, says co-director Jeff Rowe. If the new animation spawns a franchise, that is...
""We'll Dark Knight it,"" Rowe jokes to SFX magazine in the new issue, which features Good Omens season 2 on the cover, before adding that he'd ""100%"" love to develop a sequel. ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""
In TMNT lore, Shredder is the archenemy of the titular Turtles' mentor Splinter, who is voiced in the new film by Jackie Chan. Various iterations of the character, who is most often known as Oroku Saki, have have been depicted over time, including human and non-human, as well as both male and female.
As you might expect, Mutant Mayhem centers on righteous reptilians Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, as they set out to win the hearts of their fellow New Yorkers, after years of being sheltered from the human world. Alongside their new friend, April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the anthropomorphic foursome attempt to take down a mysterious crime syndicate, but find themselves in over their shells when they become the target of an army of mutants.
Seth Rogen, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, John Cena, and Paul Rudd are among the star-studded voice cast. It releases on August 4.

Referencing how the Turtles are very rarely adolescents whenever a new version of the 1980s cartoon rolls around, Rowe, who helmed the movie with Kyler Spears, told SFX: ""We wanted a teenager to watch the movie and feel seen by it and understood.
""That was our cornerstone for everything, like making the Turtles not hulking, ripped versions of themselves, but lanky and awkward. That carried through into casting actual teenagers. It's insane that it had never been done before."" Here, the eponymous quartet are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr.

,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Won’t Have Any ‘Boring’ Scenes: ‘The Movie Is Crackling With Energy,’ Says Seth Rogen – Exclusive Image",The heroes in a half shell are getting a vibrant animated overhaul with a sketchy pencil-drawn feel. Read more at Empire.,"Pause any frame from the trailers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and you’ll see an image filled with artistic flourishes. The animated overhaul of TMNT, directed by The Mitchells Vs The Machines co-director Jeff Rowe and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, has a visual style all its own – with an energy you might immediately associate with the Spider-Verse movies, but bearing a distinctive scratchy, scrawly pencil style. Channelling both the sketchy, lo-fi energy of the original off-beat Turtles comics, and the youthful exuberance of its central quartet of characters, Mutant Mayhem has been imagined as a lead-on-paper doodle come to vivid life.
The result should be another animated movie this summer that pushes the art form in a new direction. “The film itself is permeated with this teenage energy – where you don’t stay in the lines, and you’re pushing harder on the stuff that you like, and you’re impressionably scribbling in the background,” Rogen tells Empire. And once they saw what was possible visually, it upped their writing game too. “We started to write to the animation style,” he says. “It needed to capture that – we can never have boring scenes, because the movie itself just seems to be crackling with energy.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbXBpcmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL21vdmllcy9uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS13b250LWhhdmUtYm9yaW5nLXNjZW5lcy1zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Ice Cube's Mutant Mayhem Improv Accidentally Ran Up The Bill For Legal Clearances, According To Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Director","Ice Cube expressed a terrific, deep knowledge of hip hop in his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem recording sessions.","Assembling a cast of smart, clever, and funny performers to play a diverse collection of weirdos in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, director Jeff Rowe gave his actors a lot of freedom in the recording studio – even going as far as to simply record natural conversation between the four stars voicing the titular heroes. When it came to Ice Cube’s performance as Superfly, however, there was a bit of a snag. Apparently, the former N.W.A. member would express such a deep knowledge of hip hop that it threatened to raise the film’s bill for legal clearances.
Ice Cube’s time in the booth making Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem came up in conversation earlier this month when I had the chance to interview Jeff Rowe at San Diego Comic-Con 2023. Given that there is a scene in the new animated movie where Superfly has the line “Six in the mornin’, police at my door” (a line from Ice T’s “6 In The Mornin’), I asked about the movie’s meta sensibilities, and Rowe explained how O'Shea Jackson Sr.’s special expertise played into his recording sessions:
That was just Ice Cube. We'd be like, 'Can you try improving something here?' And then he would say a song lyric and we'd be like, 'That's great! You're running up the bill on the film for legal clearances.’ But has such a deep knowledge of hip hop and its history, and just like had so many things that he was able to recall so quickly. It was a delight to watch.
In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Ice Cube’s Superfly is the central antagonist and established as a criminal scourge plaguing New York City. As the Turtles are maturing and figuring out how mutants can co-exist with humanity, Superfly has a different perspective, as he has ambitions to wipe out the human race and create a world dominated by mutantkind. And evidently, the villain is very into hip hop.
Similar to the humor of Ice Cube quoting an Ice T lyric, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem also has another fun meta moment involving Jackie Chan… though Jeff Rowe also says that it’s more coincidence than anything. In the film, the action movie legend voices the paternal mutant rat Splinter, who trains the Turtles in martial arts – and the way he goes about it is by showing them footage from action movies, including the work of Jackie Chan. Smiling, Rowe told me,
Those are like accidental. I mean, we weren't... like before we cast Jackie Chan, we were like, 'We should make the fight sequences choreograph like Jackie Chan fights,' and then we cast Jackie Chan and we're like, 'This is perfect!'

2023-08-03 00:31:44+00:00,"Ramsey Naito, the Exec Behind ‘Ninja Turtles,’ Is Helping Build Paramount’s Animation Future",,"During its CinemaCon presentation this past spring, Paramount Pictures made animation the center of its showcase, showing off a slate of seven franchise films over the next two years that kicks off today with “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.”
Leading this colorful charge is Ramsey Naito, a veteran animation exec with past stints at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Blue Sky and who, under Paramount CEO Brian Robbins, was appointed to be the president of both Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation.
“Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” sees Paramount join in what has become a very competitive market for theatrical animation. Disney and Pixar, once the undisputed box office kings, have hit a rough skid in the past couple of years while Universal and Sony have yielded hits like DreamWorks’ “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” Illumination’s “Minions: The Rise of Gru” and “The Super Mario Bros.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3JhbXNleS1uYWl0by1wYXJhbW91bnQtYW5pbWF0aW9uLWludGVydmlldy10bW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-17 09:59:39-04:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate’ #1 is more or less a well-drawn ad for a mobile game,"It's a good time to be a TMNT fan, but is this mobile game adaptation worth a look?","It’s a good time to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan. The Heroes in a Half-Shell have crossed over with nearly every comic property in the universe, in addition to headlining a critically-acclaimed animated movie. Even the world of video games is getting hit with Turtlemania: first, the critically-acclaimed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin announced a game adaptation in development, and now there’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate #1. The one-shot from Henry Barajas, Pablo Verdugo, Gigi Dutriex, and Shawn Lee attempts to be a standalone tale while also leading into the events of the game. How does it succeed on those fronts?
I can’t mince words here: A good chunk of Splintered Fate #1 feels more like a checklist at times than an actual story. A LOT is crammed into 32 pages; the Turtles fight the Foot and Baxter Stockman’s Mousers. Then they have to battle Leatherhead. Then the Foot again. Not to mention the sheer weight of characters: in addition to the Turtles, there’s also Metalhead, April O’Neil, Splinter, Shredder, Karai…that’s enough to fuel at least five issues. Barajas’ script tries to be breezy, but it still feels like there are pieces missing. It also tends to fall back on stock TMNT characterizations: Splinter dispenses wise wisdom, Leonardo and Raphael butt heads, the Shredder is up to no good. Considering that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and the ongoing IDW Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series have taken the franchise in different yet familiar directions, I can’t help but feel a little let down.

However, for whatever bumps the script might have, they’re more than smoothed over by the artwork. Verdugo’s artwork is simply gorgeous; there’s more than a touch of anime influence in his designs, which fits the Turtles to a T. The designs also feel unique to each character, particularly our heroes in a half shell. Raphael is the biggest, Donatello has goggles, and Michelangelo is usually shown munching on noodles or pizza. The Shredder looks outright menacing and is covered in blades. Dutriex drenches it all in stunning colors, making sure each Turtle is a different shade of green – which contrasts with the Shredder’s silver armor and flowing red cape. There’s also some great lighting, especially in the opening sequences that feature a high-pitched battle between the Turtles and the Foot Clan against the full moon.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate #1 more or less serves as a giant ad for a mobile game, with stellar art making up for a stock story. Granted the one-shot did its job, as I’m curious enough to check out Splintered Fate. But given how other video games have translated to comics or utilized comics (Especially Fortnite), I feel like more could have been done with this concept.

2023-08-03 13:00:00-04:00,Was Splinter meant to be gay in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie?,"Paramount claims its all a big misunderstanding, but one fan theory is that they were afraid of backlash.","Conspiracy theories abound over claims that Paramount is trying to cover up the fact that a character in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) film was originally meant to be gay.
It all began with a YouTube movie reviewer who goes by the username Price of Reason. After watching an early screening of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, he expressed displeasure that Paramount tried to make Splinter, a mutant rat voiced by Jackie Chan, gay.
“To add insult to injury,” he said, “at the end of the movie Splinter is seen making out with Scumbug and then professing his love for Scumbug who he seemingly enters into a relationship with.”

“Now that in and of itself is already out of character for Splinter as we’ve known him for years, as it just doesn’t seem like something he would do. But then later after researching the character posters for this movie and also consulting with Tom from Midnight’s Edge, I’ve come to the conclusion that they’ve decided to present Splinter in this movie as an LGBT character, a creative decision that I disagree with since he’s never been presented that way in the 40 years that this franchise has existed.”
The reviewer’s evidence lies in movie posters released by ParamountUK introducing each character and the actors who play them. Because Scumbug does not speak, the poster introducing the mutant merely stated, “Scumbug as himself,” thus identifying the character with “he” pronouns. A love story between Splinter and Scumbug, then, would be one between two male mutant animals.
THE DELETED POST: pic.twitter.com/VB7G9Du8Ou — MEAD The 4K💿 Master (Tom Connors) (@ThomasConnorsJr) August 2, 2023
But in the film, released yesterday, Scumbug is referred to with “she” pronouns, and the poster identifying Scumbug as male has been deleted from social media. This has led many to believe that Scumbug was originally supposed to be male but the studio decided to change course and is now trying to cover up the original LGBTQ+ storyline.
In the comments section of his review, Price of Reason wrote, “When I saw an early screening 5 days ago, to the best of my recollection, Scumbug’s gender wasn’t mentioned one way or another. Knowing this character was historically male, after I had left the theater, I looked at Paramount’s official marketing for the movie. Their official movie character poster describes Scumbug as male and this is STILL POSTED on their official social media.”
“I find it hard to believe that a major studio that’s invested 80 million dollars in producing the movie and another 40 million in marketing it, just mistakenly misgenders their characters on official posters. I am also pretty sure that with 120 million dollars on the line, the TMNT posters had to get approval from several top studio executives before releasing the posters.”
He continued to express his belief that the gay relationship “was initially meant to be more ambiguous in the movie itself or it was toned down very recently and perhaps they also inserted a last minute overdub in the movie referring to Scumbug once as ‘she’ in order to close any loophole that would potentially cause any backlash.”
In the wake of all of this, Paramount did ultimately delete the tweet identifying Scumbug using “him.” Then director Jeff Rowe told Slashfilm that it was merely a “marketing mistake.”
“We were furious about it,” Rowe said. “They put that out, I don’t know who did that or how that happened, but we were immediately like, ‘That’s not true. Don’t put that in the world,’ and that will now be on the internet forever. But that was never the intention. That was never the character. We always imagined her to be a female cockroach. And that one poster was a slip up.”
And yet, as others have pointed out, the poster was left up for over a month and was only deleted after all of these conversations began.
If the theories are true and Paramount did try to walk back its original commitment to representation, its decision could stem from the right-wing’s determination to boycott any company that expresses support for LGBTQ+ people.
Since spring, conservatives have called for boycotts of Bud Light, Target, Lego, North Face, and numerous other brands over Pride products and LGBTQ+-inclusive marketing campaigns.
In May, two far-right commentators expressed that the goal of all this is to make support for the LGBTQ+ community “toxic” to brands. And as brands like Bud Light and Target have caved to conservative demands, they are also being accused of performative allyship.
“The way that Bud Light and Target are reacting to the far right angry at including LGBTQ+ people is EXACTLY why many of us have railed against corporate pride,” journalist and activist Erin Reed tweeted in May. “If your advocacy consists merely of rainbows that disappear at the first gust of fascist wind, it amounts to net harm.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3dhcy1zcGxpbnRlci1tZWFudC10by1iZS1nYXktaW4tdGhlLW5ldy10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-05 15:16:39+00:00,"Box Office: ‘TMNT,’ ‘Meg 2’ Racing Against ‘Oppenheimer’ for Second as ‘Barbie’ Reign Continues","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and ""Meg 2: The Trench"" openings look to take second from ""Oppenheimer,"" as ""Barbie"" stays on top.","The summer box office season may have reached the dog days of August, but it’s hardly looked stronger over the past few months. Though the openings of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Meg 2: The Trench” won’t be able to take down “Barbie” as the top performer in North America, both new releases are boosting theaters to a weekend with four different features grossing north of $25 million.
Paramount Pictures’ “Mutant Mayhem” added $9.3 million from 3,858 locations on Friday, tracking neck-and-neck with “Oppenheimer” for second place on domestic charts. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, opened with Tuesday evening preview screenings and is now tracking for a $42 million five-day debut — squarely within the projections of $35 million to $45 million heading into the weekend.
That’s not shabby for the “TMNT” entry, which cost only $70 million to produce — an especially economical figure for an animated studio release. Paramount has managed to capitalize on strong buzz as both an effective nostalgia play and a modern spin on the ’80s property. The 90% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes brought momentum into the weekend, and the glowing “A” grade through research firm Cinema Score shows early audiences are digging the latest adventures of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. As the summer season winds down, “Mutant Mayhem” should find some steady play.
The “TMNT” entry features a celebrity voice cast including Jackie Chan, Ayo Edebiri, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube and Seth Rogen, plus a group of young stars — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon — voicing the Turtle Brothers, emphasizing the first “T” of “TMNT.” Jeff Rowe directs.
Meanwhile, “Meg 2: The Trench” chowed down on $12 million from 3,503 theaters on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.2 million in Thursday previews. The hungry, hungry sequel from Warner Bros. is still tracking for an opening with a ceiling of $30 million. That’s a chunk behind the 2018 original, which saw Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against two gigantic sharks. “The Meg” earned $45 million in its domestic opening and finished with $145 million in North America and $530 million worldwide.
As its predecessor did, “The Trench,” which sees Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against even more gigantic sharks, will look to international territories as its main course to replenish a $129 million production budget. Notably, the sequel adds Wu Jing to its cast — a colossal star in China who has anchored local mega-hits such as “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” “Wolf Warrior” and “The Wandering Earth.” In fact, though Wu’s character perished in the first “Wandering Earth” entry, its follow-up was conceived as a prequel so that the actor could return to star.
Not that the first “Meg” was an awards season heavyweight, but “The Trench” hasn’t performed well in reviews (a 33% from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences also seem to be cooler on the sequel, turning in a “B” grade on Cinema Score, down from the “B+” earned by the first entry. Consensus opinion may be that the franchise has jumped the… well… but a spectacular reception would’ve marked a bit of a marketing misdirect, to put it frankly.
“Meg 2: The Trench” sees Statham and Wu team up with Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, Cliff Curtis and Sienna Guillory to take down not one, not two, but three prehistoric sharks, along with a bunch of other sea creatures. Beguilingly, the feature is based on a novel, “The Trench” by Steve Alten, and helmed by “Kill List” and “High-Rise” director Ben Wheatley, making the jump to big-budget filmmaking.
Neither sharks nor turtles can take down “Barbie” though, which added $17 million on Friday, down only 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. release has been a dominant force since scoring the biggest opening of the year and there aren’t really any signs of stopping. The hot-pink comedy will likely surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales within the next day or two.
Still the hottest ticket in the nation, “Barbie” should surge beyond a $450 million domestic gross through Sunday, placing it hot on the heels of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) to become the highest-earning North American release of the year.
It’ll be a close call for “Oppenheimer,” which may finally need to surrender second place on domestic charts to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” or “Meg 2: The Trench.” Then again, it may not. The Christopher Nolan feature is projecting $28.7 million for the weekend, which would be down an impressively slim 39% from its previous outing.
The sweeping biopic has surpassed $200 million in North America and looks to keep playing through August, already having extended its tenure in Imax auditoriums. It’s a formidable performance for such a grim chatterbox of a film, which ranks among Nolan’s top four domestic grossers ever after just two weeks of release.
The floor is collapsing under Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which earned $2.6 million on its second Friday, down a staggering 73% from its debut. The family-friendly funhouse feature should push beyond a $40 million domestic gross on Saturday — not exactly the desired return for a film with a $150 million production budget. With plenty of competition for audiences’ attention, “Haunted Mansion” may be off to an early grave.
Notably, the unlikely summer hit “Sound of Freedom” continues to perform well in its sixth weekend of release. Competitors project the feature about child sex trafficking will drop only 39% this weekend, boosting its domestic haul to $164 million — enough to surpass “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” ($156 million) to become one of the top 10 highest-grossing North American releases of the year.
The Angel Studios release has drawn a substantial amount of skepticism among box office watchers. After the credits roll on the thriller, star Jim Caviezel appears on screen to speak directly to audiences, saying that he believes “we can make ‘Sound of Freedom’ the ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of 21st-century slavery” and presenting a QR code that directs viewers to the distributor’s unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing users to donate money to Angel Studios so that it may purchase tickets for its own film and distribute them to those that request free admission. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.
It’s unclear to what degree the program has buoyed the box office fortunes of “Sound of Freedom,” but religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind the feature and a superlative “A+” grade on Cinema Score indicates that its audience is certainly enthusiastic about it. And regardless, those “Pay It Forward” ticket sales are still putting money in the pocket of exhibitors — whether people show up or not.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-09 16:00:00+00:00,A fresh approach: Seth Rogen finally gives the world a good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie • Sacramento News & Review,Timely reports from Sacramento News & Review writers on breaking news and big issues.,"By Bob Grimm
Somebody finally gets it right at bringing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the movies—and that somebody would be writer-producer Seth Rogen (along with his frequent partner, Evan Goldberg).
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem goes with stylish animation (there are no live actors) and starts from the beginning, telling the origin story of the turtles. This time, the turtles are voiced by actual teenagers, and the story features some teen angst to go with the ninja stars and pizza. The film is relatively fun—and easily the best take yet on the beloved tortoises.
Rogen and company have gathered a terrific voice cast, including Jackie Chan as Splinter the ninja rat, and Ice Cube having a blast as Superfly. Cube’s villainous turn as Superfly has a good shot at being the funniest vocal/animated performance of the year. Listen carefully, and you’ll also hear Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and Rogen himself, among others.
The turtles are voiced by a spirited cast of young men who give them a vibe fresher than incarnations past. (Eat your heart out, Corey Feldman.) The voice actors actually make Raphael (Brady Noon), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) far more than cartoon characters—they all have real dimension and heart.
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide the perfect soundscape, and the soundtrack includes one of my all-time favorites, the He-Man version of “What’s Up?” I honestly never thought I would hear that in a movie.
Visually, the film owes a lot to the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse series, and that’s a good thing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3NhY3JhbWVudG8ubmV3c3Jldmlldy5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wOS9hLWZyZXNoLWFwcHJvYWNoLXNldGgtcm9nZW4tZmluYWxseS1naXZlcy10aGUtd29ybGQtYS1nb29kLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbW92aWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Paramount Pictures CEO Challenges Disney and Pixar With Nickelodeon Animated Movies,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and SpongeBob movies are in the works from Nickelodeon Movies.","In the 1990s, the Disney Renaissance and Nickelodeon dominated animation. But with Walt Disney Animation Studios' Strange World bombing at the box office, and Pixar's Lightyear and Elemental failing to open in the #1 spot, Brian Robbins, president and CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, says audiences are looking to other studios for animated entertainment. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, from Universal's Illumination and Nintendo, scored the best box office of 2023 to date with $1.3 billion; Sony's animated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is in fourth place with $676 million, behind only Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($844 million) and Fast X ($719 million).
""It's not about Disney and Pixar anymore,"" Robbins told Variety, referencing Lightyear and Elemental's lukewarm box office. ""People are looking for animated movies that are irreverent and have a comedic point of view.""
That includes Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (in theaters August 2nd), a Seth Rogen-produced reboot of the heroes in a half-shell that has already greenlit a theatrical sequel and Paramount+ spin-off series. The new movie, which counts The Mitchells vs. the Machines and the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse as influences on its animation style, currently sits at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising its blend of heart and humor.
Next, Nickelodeon will release PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie exclusively in theaters (September 29th), while an animated musical movie relaunch of The Smurfs is in development from Paramount Animation.
Also in the works from Paramount Animation: Transformers One, an animated prequel of the Hasbro toy franchise featuring the voices of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, and Scarlett Johansson; SpongeBob SquarePants spin-off Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie; and The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, slated for a theatrical release in 2025.
Paramount established Avatar Studios in 2021 to develop new animated content from Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, including a theatrical trilogy of CG-animated Avatar movies.
""Avatar: The Last Airbender and Korra have grown at least ten-fold in popularity since their original hit runs on Nickelodeon, and [Nickelodeon Animation president] Ramsey Naito and I are incredibly excited to have [creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko's] genius talent on board to helm a studio devoted to expanding their characters and world into new content and formats for fans everywhere,"" Robbins said when announcing the Airbender franchise expansion in 2021. ""Creator-driven stories and characters have long been the hallmarks of Nickelodeon, and Avatar Studios is a way to give Mike and Bryan the resources and runway to open up their imaginations even more and dive deeper into the action and mythology of Avatar as we simultaneously expand upon that world and the world of content available on Paramount+ and Nickelodeon.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vbW92aWVzL25ld3MvcGFyYW1vdW50LW5pY2tlbG9kZW9uLWFuaW1hdGVkLW1vdmllcy10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWF2YXRhci1zcG9uZ2Vib2ItZGlzbmV5LXBpeGFyL9IBhwFodHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vbW92aWVzL2FtcC9uZXdzL3BhcmFtb3VudC1uaWNrZWxvZGVvbi1hbmltYXRlZC1tb3ZpZXMtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1hdmF0YXItc3BvbmdlYm9iLWRpc25leS1waXhhci8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Ware returned as ""Zombie Kid"" to promote the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.","Sixteen years ago, a young kid named Jonathan Ware made internet history. He was interviewed at a Waterfront Park in downtown Portland, wearing zombie face paint and had bleached hair. In addition to his unforgettable look, Ware left a lasting impression with his hilarious response to the reporter who prompted him with, “Jonathan just got an awesome face paint job. What do you think?” The stoic child simply said, “I like turtles.” And that was and it took for the internet to affectionately nickname him “Zombie Kid” and make his short video clip go viral. In anticipation of the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie, Ware made a surprise return—face paint and all.
This new video is set in the Waterfront Village of New York's Midtown. “We found the Zombie Kid a.k.a Jonathan! He still has an awesome face paint job and is here with the first review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” it says in the video's caption. When the reporter turns to the now-adult Ware, she asks him for his opinion of the new film, to which he replies: “I like turtles.” This was the same answer he gave in the interview over a decade ago. Ware even mimicked the deadpanned inflection he had as a child.
Paramount's remake of the viral sensation playfully promotes the new film, which will be released in theaters on August 2, 2023. If you “like turtles” then odds are that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will be the movie for you.

,"Tortoise rescue asks parents to buy toys, not turtles, ahead of ‘Ninja Turtles’ movie","“After seeing the film and thinking real turtles jump through the air or fly like Ninja turtles, kids ask parents to buy live turtles,” the American Tortoise Rescue said.","article
The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) is urging parents to buy toys, not real turtles ahead of the release of the movie ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.""
According to the rescue, kids often ask their parents to buy live turtles after seeing the film.
""History shows that after the release of a series of these successful Ninja movies, turtles lose their lives through the pet trade,"" ATR wrote on Monday. ""Most of the turtles have been scooped out of the wild to be sold in pet stores or over the internet.""
ATR, which is the first national turtle and tortoise rescue, said the best thing parents can do is to purchase action figure toys that actually mimic the ninja movements from the film.

""After seeing the film and thinking real turtles jump through the air or fly like Ninja turtles, kids ask parents to buy live turtles,"" the rescue continued, adding, ""Sadly, after bringing the turtle home, sticking it in a small tank and waiting for it to perform, kids abandon interest when nothing happens – the turtle just sits there.""
The red-eared slider and box turtle were the most common turtle species purchased by thousands of children who wanted their own ""Ninja"" turtle, after the successful release of previous ""Ninja Turtle"" films, according to Susan Tellem, co-founder and executive director of ATR.
""I like to say putting a turtle in a tank is how we would feel if we had to live in a bathtub all our lives,"" Tellem explained. ""The purchase is often an impulse buy without regard to the fact that turtles can live 25 years or more. Sadly, most of these turtles were abandoned in shelters and rescues or dumped into lakes and waterways (or worse toilets) after the movie’s young fans found out that the real turtles did not fight crime or perform incredible stunts.""
The rescue suggests people only adopt these turtles if they have a private pond where they can mimic their natural habitat.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" which is produced by Seth Rogan, is an animated superhero film featuring the beloved, iconic characters.
After years of being sheltered from the human world, the turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers. The movie is scheduled to be released nationwide by Paramount Pictures on Aug. 2.

Over the last few years, a number of influencers and content creators have appeared in different movies. Some have made brief, blink-and-you-’ll-miss-it cameos in box office movies, while others have starred in lower-budget stuff.
In the case of MrBeast, he surprised many fans when he was credited as being ‘Times Square Guy’ in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie. Given that it’s an animated movie, you’ve got to listen out for the YouTuber’s voice rather than seeing him in the flesh.

Naturally, he’s been eager to hype up his role, but has promoted it during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, where actors and writers are campaigning for ‘fairer’ contracts around roles.

The YouTube superstar recently promoted the movie via Instagram, which then made waves on social media. As a result, many called him a “scab” for crossing the strike picket line given other actors aren’t permitted to promote their projects during the strike – be it on social media, in person, or other avenues.

As the photo of his Instagram story promoting the new TMNT movie kept doing the rounds, MrBeast responded to some of the backlash, claiming he had an exception and could promote it.

“False, this is a contract I signed pre-strike and was legally obligated to promote. This falls under the exceptions they have outlined,” he tweeted. “Regardless, to make my support clear I’ll make a donation later tonight.”
However, the Instagram story was not removed and, as of writing, still has a few left on the 24-hour lifespan before it disappears.

2023-07-28 19:43:26.676000+00:00,Naoki Yoshida Is Wearing a TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Shirt and Final Fantasy 14 Fans Want to Know Why,"While Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida may just be a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the TMNT: Mutant Mayhem shirt he was wearing during the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest keynote has led fans to believe he is teasing something more.","While Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida may just be a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the TMNT: Mutant Mayhem shirt he was wearing during the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest keynote has led fans to believe he is teasing something more.
Much like Xbox boss Phil Spencer does, Yoshida (who is affectionately known as Yoshi-P) actually has a history of wearing shirts to tease upcoming content in Final Fantasy XIV. For example, he wore a Batman shirt before the Dark Knight class was revealed and a Bugs Bunny shirt before the Viera race was announced.
This latest tease has obviously caused fans to start guessing what it all means, especially after Yoshi-P revealed Final Fantasy 14's fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, and said two DPS jobs would be arriving alongside it. While Yoshi-P wasn't ready to share what these new jobs were or if they were related to the turtles, he did unveil it as he was talking about them.
Yoshi-P and His TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Shirt
IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?
So, if the shirt is a tease of a new class or two, what could they be? Final Fantasy 14 already has a Ninja class, a Samurai class, and a Monk class that uses Kung-Fu, so could there be an upcoming DPS class with a staff like Donatello? Could this actually also be a tease for a turtle race like the Kojin? Or could it be some kind of weapon swapper class where you will be able to switch between multiple weapons that may or may not be related to the turtle's iconic weapons?
Speaking of the Ninja, some think the team may add a new scouting class because the Ninja is the only one, and that class could possibly specialize in nunchaku or sais like Michelangelo or Raphael, respectively. Lastly, is there a chance it could be a word play like when Yoshi-P wore a Spider-Man shirt to announce the Samurai class, which sounds a lot like director Sam Raimi? There really are so many possibilities.
Either way, we have some time to wait until we get to play these new classes as Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail won't be released until Summer 2024. As for what Dawntrail is, it is meant to be the ""very best summer vacation a hero could possible have"" and will signify the first step into a ""new story"" for the game after the events of Endwalker.

In addition to all this news, Yoshi-P welcomed Phil Spencer himself on stage to help announce that Final Fantasy 14 would finally be cooming to Xbox consoles in the future.

2023-08-05 00:20:18+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director credits Spider-Verse with opening the door to unique animation,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe credits Spider-Verse with opening the door to unique animation.,"When CG animation began to take hold following the release of Toy Story, there was a period where a lot of the movies looked quite similar. Little by little, the various animation studios added their own stylistic flourishes, but it wasn’t until the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse were it felt like there was a real mainstream departure from the previous style. Since the success of Spider-Verse, we’ve seen more animated movies embrace a unique style, including the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
While speaking with THR, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe credited Spider-Verse with giving them more confidence in their style. “ The first Spider-Verse really opened a lot of doors, ” Rowe said. “ It really made it okay for studios to take chances on a film looking unique and maybe having a little bit more sophistication and emotional maturity in its storytelling. And it was such a seismic shift that it became expected. Suddenly, making movies that look like the style of CG animation over the past 30 years felt dated. And so they really paved the way for what will hopefully be a huge generation of new filmmakers with very unique expressions. “
Jeff Rowe also didn’t want to make a “grounded” Ninja Turtles movie, with dark and gritty versions of the foursome.
There’s been a little bit of a trend with superhero films, and it probably really kicked off with Batman Begins, but it’s to take the preposterous elements of the franchise and the lore and make them black and tactical and grounded and whatever the realistic version is. And so we had thought about that early on, like, “Okay, how would you actually strap a sword to yourself and do these things?” And we were like, “That’s just not the Ninja Turtles. They’re wacky. The designs are silly. That playfulness is what I loved about it as a kid, so let’s embrace that. Let’s be really grounded with New York, and then in an environment like TCRI, let’s make it look like the Technodrome.” It’s a dated, aging technology environment anyway, so it kind of makes sense. And if we found a way to make the Pizza Van make sense, then there’s definitely room to make a Turtle Blimp make sense within our own internal logic.
“ After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts, ” reads the official synopsis for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. “ Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. “
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem features the voices of Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Micah Abbey as Donatello, and Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo. The film also stars Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Seth Rogen as Bebop, John Cena as Rocksteady, Hannibal Buress as Genghis Frog, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, Ice Cube as Superfly, Post Malone as Ray Fillett, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom, Natasia Demetrious as Wingnut, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman.

2023-08-15 13:46:01+00:00,Why TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Didn’t Use the Iconic ’80s Theme Song,TMNT: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe opted to avoid the franchise's most iconic theme song to prevent alienating audiences.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe opted to avoid the franchise’s most iconic theme song to prevent alienating audiences.
Rowe broke down his reasoning during an interview with SlashFilm, noting that the inclusion of the music made popular by the original cartoon series would only have been appreciated by some fans and not general moviegoers. “It works for a certain crowd, and it works for a certain era of nostalgia for this franchise, and it’s exciting on opening weekend. But then, hopefully, this film is remembered longer than that,” Rowe said. The filmmaker elaborated that the addition of references to the past can result in a movie becoming unnecessarily dated by only appealing to a single demographic of fans.
“When you put those things in, it dates it, and I think robs it of being its own iteration, which was really important for us to make this just stand on its own feet and be a fresh reintroduction of these characters,” Rowe concluded. “So the temptation was there, but I always squirmed away from it.”
Shredder Takes a Seat
Not using the classic theme song isn’t the only major franchise staple Rowe opted to exclude. The director previously admitted that the villainous Shredder was meant to feature in Mutant Mayhem but he was ultimately cut to improve the movie’s narrative. Fans need not worry though as Rowe has confirmed the leader of the Foot Clan will plague the Turtles in the future.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is the franchise’s latest reimagining as it brings the Heroes in a Half-Shell into the modern era. The film’s unique animation style and heartfelt writing earned it plenty of praise from both critics and fans, with Paramount announcing plans to develop a sequel shortly after its premiere.

,Original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cartoon Is Now Streaming on Pluto TV for Free,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' original animated series has returned on Pluto TV prior to Mutant Mayhem's release.,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are preparing to hit the big screen once again as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will give fans a new take on the Heroes in a Half-Shell. Over the years, Michaelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael have received more animated incarnations than we can count. The animated series that started it all on the small screen debuted in 1987 and garnered nearly two hundred episodes, with the television series now available to watch on Pluto TV.
The first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series had ten seasons to its name, introducing the turtles that we've come to know over the years and adding the different colored headbands that initially didn't appear in the original comic book series. First premiering in a comic book series from Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984, taking a far darker approach to the teenage turtles than most incarnations, the four siblings all sported red masks versus the red, blue, purple, and orange that we've come to know. With the upcoming arrival of Mutant Mayhem, the latest incarnation of the Turtles will see the mutants leaning far more heavily into their ""Teenage"" aspects than many of the other takes on the ninja brothers.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Pluto TV
You can check out Pluto TV's live channel focusing on the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series here, and while the episodes aren't available to stream ""on demand"", you can re-live the earliest animated adventures for the ninja siblings. There isn't an animated series running presently, though Mutant Mayhem has been confirmed to garner a future television series and a sequel movie. With these two projects confirmed, it's clear Paramount has some serious faith in this new take on the Turtles.
In our review for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, we noted that the film was able to capture the dynamic relationship between the four turtles, noting it as a main strength of the animated movie, ""Luckily, one of the brightest parts of the film is also one of its most prominent, as these Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themselves have a chemistry that is absolutely infectious on the screen. Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, and Shannon Brown Jr. as Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michaelangelo knock it out of the park with their line delivery and how they are able to bounce quips off one another in rapid succession. These feel like brothers in an unruly family in the best possible way. The decision to make these Heroes in a Half-Shell on the younger side of their teenage years adds an adorable quality to their adventures as they attempt to navigate through a society that hates and fears them. Each turtle has their own unique personality and aesthetic that are able to sell this new iteration.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9hbmltZS9uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtb3JpZ2luYWwtc2VyaWVzLXBsdXRvLXR2LWZyZWUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9jb21pY2Jvb2suY29tL2FuaW1lL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtb3JpZ2luYWwtc2VyaWVzLXBsdXRvLXR2LWZyZWUv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Later this year, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge will release a new Dimension Shellshock DLC, which will allow players to actually mutate into those bosses ""for a few rounds."" In a new trailer released today, we can see Leonardo ""mutate"" into Rocksteady, and further clips show Bebop and Shredder taking down members of the Foot Clan! The option comes in the form of a Boss Mutations perk which players will be able to find in the Dimension Shellshock mode.
A new trailer for the Dimension Shellshock DLC can be found below. Leonardo's mutation into Rocksteady happens at the 0:44 mark.
In a new post on PlayStation's official blog, Yannick Belzil of Tribute Games went into greater detail about what to expect from Dimension Shellshock. The DLC will actually serve as a survival mode, offering ""100 unique combat challenges including a plethora of different enemy waves, each of them adapted for single or multiple players."" New Foot Soldier variants will appear, and players will have to deal with ""extreme conditions"" in these stages, including powerful wind gusts, altered gravity, and more. Belzil teases that ""adversaries evolve to become tougher versions of themselves,"" as well.
After clearing different areas, two rewards portals will be found, and either one will take the player to their next destination. However, they will offer different rewards. Pizzas will help heal up the team as usual, but players can also find canisters of Ooze, which allow them to unlock perks. Boss Mutations is one option, but players can also choose things like ""Turbo Teen"" which makes them faster, or ""Rude Dude"" which doubles attack, but also cuts defense in half (which is very Raph).
Unfortunately, there's still no actual release date for Dimension Shellshock, other than ""later this year."" With Tribute Games starting to showcase more of what to expect, hopefully it will come sooner, rather than later!

This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.
Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)
The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.
“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)
A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)
Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.
“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)
Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.
“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)
A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”
“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)
Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.
“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)
Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.
“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)
Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.
“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)
Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?
“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)
Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.
“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)
Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.

Time to get into some limited releases …
“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)
The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.
“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)
Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.
“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)
Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.
“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)
Another popular horror film from this year’s Sundance is Laura Moss’ twist on Frankenstein with the underrated Marin Ireland playing a morgue technician trying to reanimate her little girl using materials from a pregnant woman (Judy Reyes).
“The Adults” (Variance – Aug. 18)
Michael Cera, Sophia Lillis (“Stranger Things,” “Enola Holmes”) and Hannah Gross star in the latest indie dramedy from Dustin Guy Defa (“Person to Person”), playing siblings dealing with the death of their mother. It premiered at Berlin earlier this year, then played Tribeca Festival.
“Bottoms” (United Artists – Aug. 25)
At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.
“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)
This stop-motion animated film written and directed by Jim Capobianco follows the life of Leonardo da Vinci with a voice cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Daisy Ridley, Stephen Fry and Matt Berry. (This is also getting a moderate release in a very busy late August weekend.)
“Scrapper” (Kino Lorber – Aug. 25)
Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) plays the absent father of a child (Lola Campbell) who decides to live on her own after her mother dies in this feature directorial debut from Charlotte Regan.
That’s it for this month. September will be all about the festivals and the official start of Oscar season as the box office tends to slow down even more.

2023-08-07 07:01:00+00:00,It’s Time to Give Vanilla Ice’s ‘Ninja Rap’ from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II Its Due,"Face it tiger, we’ve got to accept Vanilla Ice dancing with Michelangelo is one of the crowning moments in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles history.","Of course “Ninja Rap” and Secret of the Ooze have been fairly castigated in recent decades as everything silly in kids’ entertainment became hallowed ground in adults’ modern geek culture. Over recent years, that’s meant the admittedly far superior first TMNT movie, 1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, becoming something of a classic. And to be certain, it definitely is the best Ninja Turtles flick ever produced, with Golden Harvest and New Line Cinema being somehow convinced to allow men in Jim Henson suits to flip around the rooftops of Hell Kitchen. As directed by Steve Barron, there’s even a tangible grit to its photography of late ‘80s Manhattan. The Turtles curse, swing swords, and a giant rat named Splinter uses a nunchuck to drop the Shredder off a rooftop.
It’s still a solidly PG children’s entertainment where the villains’ lair is littered with arcade cabinets and a skateboarder’s half-pipe, but the nostalgic romanticization it elicits tends to overlook those details. Just as it overlooks that a talking rat is also shown communicating with the talking turtles by using the power of the Force Ninjitsu to cast astral projections, and that the aforementioned Turtles also love nothing more than skateboarding and eating pizza.
1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has got an edge for a family movie, sure, but Taxi Driver, it ain’t. But its reputation in geekdom skews toward that because of how silly, and ultimately terrible, this franchise became to adult eyes by the time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III rolled around in 1993.
Even so, it’s time to stop lumping Secret of the Ooze in with that third movie because the Turtles didn’t get to use their swords and sais as much as they did in the first film—or that they danced with Vanilla Ice. Hell, it’s because they danced with Vanilla Ice that the sequel has a trace of pop culture relevance to this day, albeit as a two-bit piece of kitsch for the third graders. But then again, that’s who Ninja Turtles has always belonged to, or at least it has ever since that cartoon show with the catchy jingle in 1987.
And on the subject of catchy jingles, “Ninja Rap” has become a pop culture treasure for a reason. It’s even included as an easter egg in this year’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
Onscreen the scene occurs in Secret of the Ooze because in their battle with the evil Foot Clan, plus new scary mutants Tatsu and Rahzar, the Turtles inadvertently bust into a Brooklyn nightclub in the warehouse district where Vanilla Ice and a pair of back-up dancers are bopping in synchronized unity. At a glance the scene appears to have instantly reached maximum levels of early ‘90s cheese… and then not one, but two guys with rat ponytails show up.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RpbWUtZ2l2ZS12YW5pbGxhLWljZS1uaW5qYS1yYXAtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1paS1pdHMtZHVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 13:16:59+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem review: youthful and fun animation,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is bursting with action, silliness, and emotion - here's our review.","Share this Article:
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is bursting with action, silliness, and emotion – here’s our review.
While their father, mutant rat Splinter (Jackie Chan) is desperate to keep them away from the cruel, violent and judgmental outside world, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will do anything to be a part of it. Attempting to win over the people of New York with acts of heroism, under the guidance of human ally April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), they decide to take on criminal mastermind Superfly (Ice Cube). Mayhem, involving mutants, ensues.
What an energizing and refreshing movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is. The film’s look, an imperfect, sketch-styled animation that takes place at night under streetlights and neon signs, is incredible. The pace, the sound, the script, the characters; everything is so full of life and movement. Released in a glut of summer blockbusters where it can be hard to work out which movies will be tired and formulaic, this is a full on blast of fresh and invigorated filmmaking.
The action sequences are visually engaging and exciting – clear, colourful and buzzing with adrenaline. It’s the antithesis of the overloaded CGI that has plagued some other recent films (leading to action sequences produced on blockbuster budgets that are little more than pixel–mulch). The scenes here are thrilling; the final battle in particular is a big, bombastic climax.
While the striking animation style is likely to grab your attention, everything in this film spins out of the youthful and excitable version of the Turtles. With Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon) and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) all played by voice actors who are actually teenagers, the Turtles have never felt like a more real and relatable group of kids. From that comes this loose animation style, excitable visual asides and fully charged action sequences.
The script comes from Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jeff Rowe, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit (with ‘story by’ credits for Rogen, Goldberg Rowe and Brendan O’Brien, and based on credits for Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird). It performs an incredible balancing act, infusing a steady stream of jokes (every character gets a chance to be funny) with a story that builds to an excellent climactic battle and deeply satisfying ending. My only real complaint about Mutant Mayhem is that it potentially has too many characters; it’s not overstuffed, but I wanted more of some of the supporting characters.
Perhaps that’s because the cast is electric. The four Turtles are allowed to lead; their characters are immediately defined, and all are really likable and funny. Ice Cube appears to relish the role of Superfly, while Paul Rudd’s Mondo Gecko is an unstoppable scene stealer. Jackie Chan’s Splinter, too, is delightful and heartening.
Mutant Mayhem's action sequences can be quite intense. That’s because of the brilliant animation, of course, but they’re all pulled tight by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ score. Any ideas that Reznor had jettisoned his Nine Inch Nails credibility to make a zany cartoon score are way off the mark. The music is dark and imposing at times, beautiful and affecting at others.
While Mutant Mayhem will draw obvious (and warranted) comparisons to the Spiderverse movies due to its look (and it’s not particularly interesting to say but the movie is visually stunning), it also shares a director (Jeff Rowe) with the excellent The Mitchells Vs The Machines. Mitchells was produced by Lord and Miller at the same time as Into The Spiderverse, and Rowe’s movie certainly bears that experience. Mutant Mayhem is co-directed by Kyler Spears. There’s such a big creative team that seem to be sharing so many credits in Mutant Mayhem; rather than attempt pick out who deserves praise for what, it feels like a better idea to just celebrate everyone.
One of my favourite things about Mutant Mayhem is how gross it can get. It gets gloopy and disgusting. In that way, the movie itself is a bit like a teenager; at once sophisticated and juvenile. In capturing an authentic youthful feeling, in being slimy and gooey and silly, and in being a story about community and family, it feels like an elevation of everything Nickelodeon were doing in the 90s.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has this formidable, intense score, wonderful and funny character writing, a striking visual style and brilliantly exciting action sequences. It’s funny and gross and cool and sweet. All of these thing just come bursting out of this film in a big ball of infectious energy.
The team behind Mutant Mayhem has created something special. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise probably needed to be reinvigorated, but I’m so bored of reading about what films mean for franchises – whether this movie or that will allow some faceless corporate money machine to continue to try to draw growth percentages from the brands that they’ve bought.
Mutant Mayhem isn’t another piece of content puked out by an algorithm, it’s this awesome, exciting, uplifting movie about these outsider kids trying to find a place in the world. It can mean whatever it means for the branding – for your afternoon in the multiplex, it means you’re probably gonna have a fantastic time with this joyous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a film about mutants that is full of humanity. It is outrageous that the modern studio system was able to produce a TMNT movie this good.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is in cinemas now.

,The Bear and TMNT Star's Hilarious Star Wars Review Goes Viral,Ayo Edebiri was 'shocked' by what Yoda looked like in The Empire Strikes Back.,"Ayo Edebiri is currently blowing up in Hollywood. Not only is the actor one of the stars of the hit series, The Bear, but fans can also currently catch her on the big screen in two movies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Theater Camp. Her next film, Bottoms, is also being released in theaters this month, and she will soon be joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Thunderbolts. Before she was a star, Edebiri was a writer who was big on Twitter and Letterboxd. In fact, she currently has over 60,000 followers on the movie review site, which is quite a lot by their standards. Edebiri is known for writing funny reviews, and her post about Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back from earlier this year is going viral on Twitter.
""This movie is great but I was really shocked by how ugly Yoda was sorry if that pisses anybody off but I had only seen baby Yoda and adult Yoda is f*cking busted,"" Edebiri wrote back in February. Despite disliking Yoda, she gave the movie 4.5 stars, so it's safe to say she enjoyed the Star Wars classic. You can check out a screenshot of the review that has since gone viral below:
Recently, Edebiri said that she might plan to scale back on her funny Letterboxd reviews now that she's focusing more on acting than writing. ""I saw this interview where [Willem Dafoe] was like, 'The reason I keep working is that nobody knows my taste,'"" Edebiri shared with Backstage. ""Because comedy is my bedrock, expressing my opinions is something I'm so used to in my career,"" she explains. ""Even as a writer, saying your opinions can be beneficial. As an actor...maybe mystery behooves me a little bit.""
Ayo Edebiri On Joining Marvel:
Reports have indicated that Edebiri was cast in a mystery role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Thunderbolts movie, although that casting has yet to be confirmed by Marvel Studios.
""I don't know,"" Edebiri said in an interview with ComicBook.com, which you can check out above. ""As a big X Men kid, I feel like if there's... I don't know. I don't think I'm cool enough to play Storm.""
""If there's anybody in that arena I get, you know, some powers,"" Edebiri continued. ""I could do things that make sense with my hands. I'd throw down. Yeah, I'm down.""

,Best Ice Cube Movies,"From 'Barbershop' to 'xXx: State of the Union,' Moviefone counts down the 20 best films of Ice Cube's cinematic career.","Forget Cher or Barbra Streisand, there is a strong argument to be made that Ice Cube is the most successful musician turned actor of all time!
The former member of N.W.A. made his big screen debut in director John Singleton's 'Boyz n the Hood,' and since then has created and appeared in such beloved franchises as the 'Friday,' 'Barbershop' and 'Ride Along' series.
In honor of his new movie, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,' which opens in theaters August 2nd, Moviefone is counting down the 20 best movies of Ice Cube's acting career, including his latest.
Let's begin!

Reggie Wright (Mike Epps) is a slippery con artist who is avoiding the law, and Jackson. During a cat and mouse chase, the two stumble on a multi-million dollar diamond heist. Hiding from Jackson, Wright finds himself in the thieves' getaway van and ends up having to escape from them after they discover their booty is fake, much to the displeasure of their ruthless boss (Tommy Flanagan). When Wright meets up with his girlfriend (Eva Mendes), he discovers that his recently purchased lottery ticket is the sole winner of $60 million. Unfortunately, his wallet, which held the ticket, was left in the thieves' van, so he persuades Jackson to help him get it back.

2023-08-09 13:00:00+00:00,Ayo Edebiri Is Suddenly Everywhere,"Ayo Edebiri talks about her career, journey to starring on 'The Bear', fan theories, and new projects Bottoms, Theater Camp and Thunderbolts.","On a Saturday morning, Ayo Edebiri is discussing her first name. The restaurant required I put in my name for the breakfast order, a mundane request for most people but a potential point of distress for those of us with phonetically daunting monikers. The stakes are low if you’re a journalist but much higher if you’re a young actress and writer with one of the most electric careers of the moment — and a summer slate that’s poised to further cement her stardom. Ayo (EYE-oh) is a star of The Bear, FX’s restaurant-set dramedy that became a runaway hit last summer and returned for season two in June. She has film roles in Theater Camp, Bottoms and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem; makes a memorable appearance in the much-discussed first episode of Black Mirror‘s latest season, “Joan Is Awful”; and will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Thunderbolts alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Steven Yeun. Yet she still recalls (and sometimes still endures) the countless incorrect pronunciations. “I know that feeling of anticipating somebody being confused over your name well,” she says when I explain my awkward reaction to the hostess’ well-meaning request and aversion to correcting people. “But we might as well try.”

Edebiri, open, warm and quick to banter, has spoken in the past about having little in common with The Bear‘s Sydney Adamu, the earnest and occasionally vexing sous chef (and eventual chef de cuisine) to Jeremy Allen White’s culinary wunderkind Carmy, but it quickly becomes clear they share a fastidious attention to detail, a need to get things just right. “Sometimes when I do these interviews, I can tell I’m a writer because when I speak, it’s just a first draft,” she says of her tendency to correct herself or cast around for the best turn of phrase. “I’m deleting and editing in real time.” (A member of both the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, Edebiri spoke with THR before the actors guild called a strike on July 13.)
Another similarity: Both Sydney and Ayo seem to know everyone in the local restaurant scene. Shortly after we’re seated in a corner table at All Time, a trendy café south of Griffith Park where the menu is scrawled onto butcher paper nightly, she recognizes several people. We’ve barely made a dent in our respective bowls of yogurt and chia-forward granola when she spots a table full of friends from the neighborhood. She stops to chat with a runner who also works at Little Dom’s, the ever popular Italian joint up the street. Later, when we’re at Dinosaur Coffee, the baristas around the counter ask about her dog, Grommet, and her vacation plans; there’s a facetious request to bring back some clothes from Paris Fashion Week (“No, yeah, I’ll definitely think about it,” she deadpans). She’s made fast friends across the entertainment industry, too, finding her footing quickly despite entering a cutthroat environment without a single connection.

Edebiri, 27, grew up in what she describes in her stand-up act as the “gorgeous Caucasian haven of Boston, Massachusetts,” an only child of immigrant parents (her father is Nigerian, her mother from Barbados) with a large extended family and equally large church circle. She remembers being social in high school, being good at school, being very involved with clubs and improv. “I was definitely dealing with a lot of hormones and undiagnosed things swirling around, but I was also very focused on sorting out my adult life,” she says. “I’m a future person, always wondering what’s the next move. I’m very rarely here.”
That future was New York University, where she enrolled to study education before ultimately switching to its Tisch School for the Arts (and the Dramatic Writing program) once she decided to give herself entirely over to her show business aspirations. She worked multiple jobs in addition to the coursework and her near-nightly stand-up shows, moonlighting as a nanny, a barista and (as is The Bear canon by now) in restaurants, including Jean-George Vongerichten’s ABC Kitchen. The school introduced her to a cadre of fellow strivers in an environment she describes as similar to a conservatory: “Writing was all I could think about — I was in the deep end.”
Edebiri had a plan to break into the business. She was going to give herself three to four years to get a writers assistant job and then another four years to get staffed. Cold emails to reps led nowhere. Instead, her manager found her after reading a humor piece she had co-written for The New Yorker (“So You Want to Date a New York Museum”) and eventually came to see her act.
Edebiri’s first entertainment job was helping in the writers room of Franchesca Ramsey’s Comedy Central pilot (which never made it to air). She then flew to Los Angeles for meetings and landed punch-up gigs on various scripts. She was still performing in as many stand-up shows as she could manage, and the right people started to take notice. “I had no framework for this kind of career,” she says, “but I think a little bit of delusion is healthy here. Because we’re doing a delusional thing. A career in the arts? It’s delusional.” By 2019, she was living in Los Angeles and writing on Sunnyside, the one-season-long NBC comedy created by Kal Penn, and she joined rooms for Dickinson and Big Mouth soon after — all according to her plan, but much, much faster.
Edebiri wrote on Big Mouth and later voiced the geeky teenager Missy, after Jenny Slate stepped down during the summer of 2020 amid controversy over her voicing a mixed-race character as a white actress. On Dickinson, the Apple TV+ series reimagining Emily Dickinson’s early days, she was hired as a writer and was later cast as the supporting character of Hattie, a maid and friend of Hailee Steinfeld’s titular poet. She always had an eye toward performing and says that she has adapted her career plan accordingly. “I’m now always checking in with myself and giving myself space for my goals to shift as my life shifts,” she says, also noting that she can be coy with the way she articulates her creative desires. “Even if I’m phrasing things in a way like, ‘I don’t know what I want,’ it’s because I know.”
It was while on Dickinson that Edebiri met Christopher Storer, who directed two of Edebiri’s episodes. At the time, he was still developing the show that would become The Bear. When it came time to cast it, he quickly thought of Edebiri for Sydney.

The Bear changed everything. The series, about an award-winning chef who returns to Chicago to salvage the family restaurant after his brother’s suicide, was a sleeper hit last year and earned nearly universal critical acclaim. It launched several (overlapping) fandoms — the earliest, and often the loudest, revolves around the internet’s obsession with and babygirlification of White as Carmy, the tortured and tattooed bad boy with a heart of gold (sort of), but a close second was Edebiri’s performance as the hyper-driven Sydney. Earlier this year, White won the Golden Globe, and Edebiri took home a Spirit Award for best supporting performance in a new scripted series. In July, they were both nominated for Emmys (in addition to the show’s outstanding comedy series nod).
Season two follows the crew of the cult sandwich shop The Beef as they struggle through attempts to flip the restaurant into a fine-dining establishment, a process that opens up the storylines of the whole ensemble and complicates the emotionally charged relationship between Carmy and Sydney. Their dynamic as professional partners is stress-tested by the horrors of opening a new restaurant (red tape, budget woes, mold, oversalting a test dish) and by Carmy’s budding romance with an old friend (played by Molly Gordon, co-director and co-star of Theater Camp). After all 10 episodes dropped on June 22, the premiere became the most watched FX show on Hulu (the networks won’t release streaming numbers but noted that the audience was 70 percent higher than the first season during the same time frame).
Edebiri is not involved in writing The Bear, though Storer has shared his plan for a third season with her — she won’t tell me what it involves, only that it “makes sense” to her. “I guess I want Syd to keep pushing,” she says.
She’s also been made aware of the (seemingly) sizable group of Carmy-Sydney shippers that have appeared, rising from the Twitter mist to declare their allegiances to an imaginary romance. These fan theories are something of a pain point for Edebiri, who says she is grateful that people are so engaged with the show, but that it’s “frustrating.” She adds: “It’s really not our thought process when we’re making the show, and I understand it can be part of a show’s culture — but I don’t think they’re going to get what they want.” Gordon told THR that while she also doesn’t subscribe to the shipper theories, she believes it’s a testament to the work of Storer, White, and Edebiri that they’re able to create something so passionate. “I think it’s incredibly cool to have this dynamic onscreen that isn’t romantic, but that feels charged and sexy,” she said.
Narratively speaking, Edebiri isn’t actually sure that Carmy should be in a relationship with anyone (“It’s TV, do you want to see Walter White go to therapy and then reunite with his family?” she asks with a laugh), but admits that she can’t resist falling — platonically! — for the character’s complicated charms. “I love this little fucked up guy in the kitchen,” she says before quickly self-editing. “Or wait, this messed-up guy.” (The more she reads her own interviews, the more she sees her own explicit language: “I think I do it when I’m telling a joke, like I’m putting a swear in there to let you know I’m saying a joke — it’s something for me to reflect on.”)
At this point, I remember — and bring up — a tweet I saw recently, that drew a line between the many years that Succession fans spent caring (deeply) about the show’s (deeply) damaged men and the way they were able to quickly jump to the stage of “babygirlifying” the men of The Bear. She looks aghast, the parasocial implications a step too far even for someone from her inherently online cohort. “That is so Internet,” she manages, her expression a flash of the face-acting that has become a hallmark of her Emmy-nominated performance.
As The Bear’s main characters went on their own journeys this season, it created moments of quiet — a creative pivot that felt rewarding to the viewer but often lonely for its actors, who grew to love the fast-paced, raucous, highly choreographed scenes in The Beef’s back-of-house. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays hotheaded “cousin” Richie, previously told THR that he “mourned” the loss of those chaotic days, and Edebiri felt a similar melancholy while filming episode three (“Sundae”), which follows Sydney as she travels across Chicago for culinary inspiration. “It was just two weeks of shooting me eating food and being in the cold, and I was by myself and missing everybody,” she says. “That’s the hardest type of acting for me, where it’s like, you’re a person, by herself, being vulnerable. There are 40 teamsters around and I’m just by myself in front of everybody.” (But she did love that she got to contribute something from her own closet to Sydney’s wardrobe: that quirky little detachable puffer hood. “It’s sick,” she says with glee. “Next winter everyone is going to be buying this shit, but it’s fine. I’m happy I did it.”)

Storer brought back some of season one’s notorious chaos for “Fishes,” the flashback Christmas episode that offered a window into Carmy’s deep-seated trauma. The stand-alone brought in such heavyweight guest stars as Jamie Lee Curtis (as Carmy’s mother, Donna Berzatto), Jon Bernthal, Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, John Mulaney and Storer’s longtime partner, Gillian Jacobs. Edebiri does not appear in “Fishes” — she shadowed Storer on set as he directed the episode and was given a co-executive producer credit. She says Storer noticed her aspirations before she saw them in herself: “When I met Chris, he was like, ‘You’re going to be a director’ — I just said, ‘Cool, you’re directing my life, and I love it.’ ” She says she is indeed interested in more producing and directing work and was greatly inspired by Storer’s collaborative style. Watching an ego-less showrunner at work, she says, taught her that “you can be a director without being omnipotent; you’re not an almighty power floating in the sky with a little monocle and a megaphone, or whatever.”
Two of the other releases that make up this Summer of Ayo — Theater Camp (out now) and Bottoms (Aug. 25) — are helmed by close friends, part of a growing web of close collaborators. Edebiri met Bottoms co-writers Rachel Sennott and Emma Seligman while at NYU. Seligman later directed Sennott and Gordon in her feature debut, Shiva Baby; during filming, Sennott organized a “girls hang” to introduce Gordon and Edebiri. “She lost her credit card within the first hour of being there, so I felt like we were going to be friends,” Gordon recalls.

In Theater Camp, a mockumentary about a summer arts camp under threat of financial insolvency, Edebiri appears alongside Ben Platt and a bevy of comedy’s rising stars like Patti Harrison, Jimmy Tatro, Noah Galvin and Owen Thiele. Gordon wrote the part of an instructor who lied on her résumé to get the job specifically for Edebiri, relishing the idea of allowing what she saw as Edebiri’s “unbelievably wacky” side to flourish. The character that Edebiri brought to the screen vacillates between deadpan delivery and energetic outbursts, which feels reminiscent of her early stand-up work, and occasionally borders on the nonsensical, much like her social media presence. (See her Twitter bio, which identifies her — incorrectly and without explanation — as “Showrunner of The Kominsky Method, now streaming on Netflix, Vudu, and the ITV app.”)
The Bear’s first season dropped the day that Edebiri started filming Theater Camp with Gordon in upstate New York, offering a striking view into the actress’ range. “She can be messing around and goofing off, and then the second the camera rolls, she’s delivering the most dropped-in performance you’ve ever seen,” says Gordon.
Edebiri’s part in Bottoms was also written just for her. Seligman and Sennott had been working on the film — about queer teenagers who start a fight club at their high school to get closer to their crushes — since 2017, and once they decided to make the raunchy romp a two-hander, Seligman suggested their mutual friend to play opposite Sennott. Seligman met Edebiri at a party and remembers an inherent sweetness that she now sees reflected in the way she performs. “She was just so awkward and funny and nerdy,” Seligman says, “and had such a good handle on slapstick physical humor that you never really see in the alt-comedy scene.” She references an early bit from Edebiri’s stand-up where she does an impression of an emcee/hype man trying to work the crowd despite feeling debilitatingly sad; there’s also a moment from a landmark Comedy Central set wherein the comedian makes fun of her own brand-new, blindingly white Vans, punctuating the joke with a Molly Shannon-esque high kick.
As Edebiri recalls, she had to audition for the role that had been custom written for her. “I’m still slightly salty about it,” she says. “I don’t know who made me audition, but I passed.” Seligman recalls it as more of a chemistry read — a “box to check” for the studio (Orion) to give its blessing on the onscreen matchup between Edebiri and Sennott. The actress already had been cast on The Bear, but the show hadn’t been given the season order. “Her résumé was good and it was already obvious that her career had so much promise,” says Seligman, “but it was cool to feel validated that we all saw something.”

The day of our interview, Edebiri is flying to Paris to attend the debut Thom Browne couture show, which will also be her first-ever fashion show. The brand has a knack for tapping into the cultural moment — Browne’s Fall/Winter 2022 campaign featured Euphoria‘s Angus Cloud and Chase Sui Wonders of Bodies Bodies Bodies, and he has dressed Cloud’s co-star Maude Apatow as well as Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. “I wouldn’t say I’m totally comfortable in that world, but I’m learning it,” she says. “Right now, I’m like, ‘How should I be at a show?’ ” Though she’s often in the ultra-casual wardrobe of a Los Angeles screenwriter (today’s ensemble includes a denim jacket and sweatpants), she loves clothes, and her growing fame gives her greater entrée into the space. Recent press appearances have seen her in everything from heritage luxury brands like Valentino to ready-to-wear from Rosie Assoulin and Ernest W. Baker. She’s becoming something of a Browne devotee in her own right — she wore one of his signature suits when she accompanied him to the CFDA Awards, and he created the custom chef jacket that Carmy gifts Sydney in The Bear‘s season two finale.

Here at All Time, the morning has gotten a little away from us. We met at 8 o’clock on the dot so she can catch her flight tonight. After the Thom Browne show in Paris, she’ll shoot THR‘s cover, then pop over to London, Copenhagen, Minorca and Lisbon to see various friends. The trip came out of a realization that, during interviews, she was constantly asked questions like “When do you sleep?” or “When are you going to take a break?” without a good answer. She seems a little bit anxious. She hasn’t packed yet, and now the dog sitter is en route to her house for the handoff, and we’re still picking chia seeds out of our teeth.
We wrap up quickly — she’s barely touched her oat milk cappuccino in its handmade speckled-beige ceramic mug — and she drives us back to her house, Grommet balancing daintily on my knees. After Grommet is safely ensconced in the dog sitter’s car, we walk for more cappuccinos (iced this time), and the conversation turns to relationships. She’s on good terms with her ex, who is in the process of moving from New York to Los Angeles and will soon be another source of pet care (apparently great terms is more like it) and is intrigued by my own (relative) apathy toward marriage. “You could do a small party, which is my dream, even though it’s crazy because my family is so big,” she says. “If I ever had a wedding …by the way, literally, who am I dating?”
After we’re situated on the back patio of Dinosaur Coffee, a man approaches, bursting to offer his congratulations on Edebiri’s recent success. His companion quickly chides him for interrupting, putting her in the uncomfortable position of having to make this stranger feel better for having entered her space.
She has described a singular drive to enter the entertainment business as a writer, but given her seemingly fated pivot to on-camera work, I’m curious whether she ever stopped to consider if it would make her truly famous. “No, I’d be insane,” she says. “Some people are literally supermodels, so it makes sense that their life would change.” She didn’t imagine herself in the spotlight because that would betray the self-deprecation inherent in her comedy work, and now she’s having to make sense of phenomena like fans screenshotting her online film reviews from Letterbox’d (posting on the site is “supposed to be fun,” she says, “and that makes it not fun”) or being asked to do things like this interview.
I ask whether she enjoys (or tolerates) watching herself onscreen, and she explains that, for now, she’s able to “zoom out” and not get in her own head but that it will get harder if she’s ever the lead of a project. Wasn’t she essentially the lead of The Bear’s second season, I wonder? She begins talking about how the show opened up for all the characters and how much she loved Moss-Bachrach’s work, particularly in episode seven. “This deflecting,” she adds with a grin. “Do you like it?”
And then it’s nearly time to go — there are books to pack (David Grann’s new nonfiction) and shoes to ponder over (“What about a sneaker and a ballet flat?” she asks. “Those are two good shoes.”) She entertains a final question about Thunderbolts, the upcoming Marvel antihero film that, at least until the SAG strike, was supposed to start filming this summer and hit theaters next July, employing a deft evasiveness one can only assume is taught in some sort of pre-Marvel boot camp.
What can you tell me about Thunderbolts? I ask.
“I know that I’m in it, and I’m excited to be in it,” she says.
Do you have to keep your schedule clear in the meantime?
“I don’t know.”
You don’t know …
“I don’t know. I know that I’ve been cast.”
So you signed something …
“I don’t know.”
I pivot, remarking on how stressful that sounds — that most people would struggle with that lack of control.
“It actually isn’t,” she says. “You’ve got to embrace the unknown. That’s literally half of my therapy — it’s just my therapist being like, ‘Isn’t not knowing exciting?’ And I’m like, it actually is kind of beautiful. It’s kind of sick. I’m at a place where my life has opened up in all these different ways, and I’m trying to be there for it, to be an active participant in my whole life and be OK with making mistakes,” she says, then obliquely references her moment of ubiquity. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is that you have to rely on people. You can’t do this on your own. Sometimes I just ask friends to get a drink so I can complain, or to get a drink so they can tell me about their life and I can remember there are bigger things than this.” It’s a valid point, but this, it must be said, feels pretty freaking big.

This week’s report takes a preliminary look at two releases from major studios slated to open August 11: Gran Turismo and The Last Voyage of the Demeter.
Updated tracking for Barbie can also be found below, as the film continues to shatter expectations with pre-sales pacing higher than for any release since Black Panther: Wakanda Forever last November. Likewise, Oppenheimer is maintaining its relatively robust pace as the two films look to combine for a powerhouse weekend at the box office one week from now.
Gran Turismo
Sony Pictures
August 11, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $15M-$20M
Domestic Total Range: $35M-$55M
PROS:
The Gran Turismo video game franchise has endured over the last few decades, with its popularity helping to boost awareness and interest for this film adaptation.
Director Neill Blomkamp has had prior success with late summer releases in the form of District 9 and Elysium.
The movie’s fact-based approach to story—at its center is Jann Mardenborough, who went from playing the Gran Turismo game to embarking on a successful career as a professional race driver—might help this stand out from past video game adaptations.
CONS:
A significant amount of competition for male audiences will be in play late this summer, with Gran Turismo‘s opening weekend going up against the second frames of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Meg 2: The Trench.
Hollywood’s actors joining writers in their ongoing strike could impact the talent promotion phase of marketing.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter
Universal Pictures
August 11, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $5M-$10M
Domestic Total Range: $14M-$28M
PROS:
Horror has quite often over-delivered at the box office in recent months and years. This summer, however, has been light on horror releases, which could spur interest here if reviews and audience buzz are positive.
CONS:
The film has been delayed several times by this point, and early social metrics aren’t encouraging. With abundant competition for male audiences and the aforementioned possibility of the actors’ strike affecting promotion, it’ll be challenging for this to stand out based on current models.

2023-06-24 04:31:07+00:00,Pizza Hut tests underground deliveries ahead of ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ movie release,"In a nod to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ favorite food, Pizza Hut served up its signature dish to select customers in the subways of New York City, the company announced.","CNN —
In a nod to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ favorite food, Pizza Hut served up its signature dish to select customers in the subways of New York City, the company announced.
The limited-time underground deliveries were part of a promotion for the upcoming film, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which hits theaters August 2, according to a news release.
“Pizza Hut and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a longstanding history that goes back to the ’90s. Bringing the two together again for a new generation was a no-brainer,” said Pizza Hut’s chief marketing officer, Lindsay Morgan, in the release.
“We wanted to pay homage to the Turtles’ origins and their love of pizza, while also infusing modern touchpoints and a fun, creative take on pizza deliveries,” Morgan said.
Select pizza lovers in Manhattan got to experience the out-of-the-ordinary pizza-ordering experience by texting a turtle emoji to a special phone number.
The text placed an order for a Pizza Hut meal that the company said would be delivered “within minutes” to designated pizza drop zones within a subway station, the release stated.
A YouTube video from the pizza company showed subway travelers appearing in disbelief at Union Square station as the pizza they ordered via text was hand delivered to them.
The underground delivery test was also a reference to the fictional crime-fighting turtles’ home within New York City’s sewer system.
Pizza Hut has previously been involved with promoting films in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles universe.
In 2014, the company unveiled a life-sized version of the turtles’ pizza-throwing van at the San Diego Comic-Con, according to MTV. The van was featured in the cartoon based on the characters that aired during the 1980s and 1990s.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8yNC9idXNpbmVzcy9waXp6YS1odXQtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy10cm5kL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWJodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzA2LzI0L2J1c2luZXNzL3BpenphLWh1dC10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLXRybmQvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 14:37:43+00:00,“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” – 15 Horror Icons Who Appeared in Nickelodeon’s 2012 Animated Series,"Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series is loaded with love for the horror genre, and it's packed with horror icons.","While much of the initial fanbase that helped turn Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into a pop culture phenomenon aged out following the original cartoon (1987-1996) and live action movies (1990-1993), the property has continued to flourish with reboots in TV, film, and comics every few years.
If the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has you interested in exploring various versions of TMNT, there’s no better place for a horror fan to start than Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series that aired for five seasons between 2012 and 2017.
While there’s an inherent connection to horror in the various mutants and monsters that pop up throughout the franchise, no rendition embraces the genre nearly as much as this one. In addition to references to classics like Alien, Friday the 13th, and The Evil Dead, the series employed several notable horror actors throughout its 124-episode run.
Here are 15 horror icons who lent their voices to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2012.
1. Corey Feldman – Slash
Corey Feldman may not be synonymous with horror, but the pedigree of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, The Lost Boys, and Gremlins is more than enough to make him an icon of the genre. His TMNT legacy is even stronger, having voiced Donatello in the first and third live action films.
In animated form, Feldman play Slash, who was a villain in the original series but an ally in this version. He starts out as Raphael’s pet tortoise, Spike, before being accidentally mutated. He’s introduced in Season 2’s “Slash and Destroy” and appears in total of 12 episodes, culminating with the series finale, “The Big Blow Out.”
2. Kelly Hu – Karai
Feldman’s not the only Friday the 13th franchise alumnus on the show. Kelly Hu’s resume includes The Scorpion King, X2: X-Men United, and Arrow, but horror fans will recall her film debut as Eva in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan.
Hu plays the integral TMNT role of Karai, a character that debuted in the comics in 1992 and previously appeared in the 2003 animated series. She’s in 31 episodes of TMNT 2012, from season 1’s “New Girl in Town” to season 5’s “The Foot Walks Again.”
In this incarnation, Karai starts out as a fierce, teenage Foot Clan member that was raised by the evil Shredder. She later aligns herself with the Turtles upon the revelation that she’s actually Master Splinter’s biological daughter from before he was mutated. In season 3, she’s exposed to a mutagen that gives her serpent-like abilities.
3. Cassandra Peterson – Ms. Campbell
Cassandra Peterson — beloved by all as horror host Elvira — is usually vivacious, but her part on TMNT required a more monotonous performance. She voices Ms. Campbell/Utrom Queen in six episodes, from season 1’s “The Alien Agenda” to season 5’s “When Worlds Collide.”
Ms. Campbell is introduced as a woman who takes an interest in April O’Neil before it’s revealed that she’s an evil robot sent by the evil Krang, armed with laser eyes and missile arms. When her human disguise is damaged in season 4’s “The War for Dimension X,” the Utom Queen’s true form is revealed.
4. Keith David – Sal Commander
Keith David achieved cult status for his roles in The Thing (which, incidentally, inspired TMNT’s season 3 episode “Burned Secrets”) and They Live, but his rich pipes have also earned him Emmy awards. His extensive voice work includes Gargoyles, Coraline, The Princess and the Frog, Spawn, and Rick and Morty.
On TMNT, he voices Sal Commander (also known as G’Throkka) for five episodes, from season 4’s “The Moons of Thalos 3” to season 5’s “When Worlds Collide Part 2.” An ally to the Turtles, Sal is the commander of the Salamandrians, an extraterrestrial species that resembles large, humanoid salamanders.
5. Jeffrey Combs – Rat King
Rat King is a villain that originated in the comics and appeared in both the 1987 and 2003 animated series. Re-Animator star Jeffrey Combs lends his voice to the character for four episodes of the 2012 rendition.
He debuts as Dr. Victor Falcon in season 1’s “Monkey Brains” and returns in “I, Monster,” in which his experiments yield him the ability to control rats, hence the Rat King moniker. Splinter defeats him and his army of giant rats in season 2’s “Of Rats and Men.” His final appearance is in season 4’s “Darkest Plight” as a hallucination to Splinter.
6. Ron Perlman – Armaggon
Ron Perlman has played and/or appeared alongside various creatures in the likes of Hellboy, Blade II, Alien: Resurrection, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and Sleepwalkers. For three episodes in TMNT’s fourth season, he voiced the villainous Armaggon, an alien cyborg shark.
Armaggon debuts in “The Outlaw Armaggon” as a bounty hunter hired by crime lord Vringath Dregg (voiced by Peter Stormare) to capture the Turtles. He makes his final appearance in “The Evil of Dregg,” in which he’s defeated for good.
7. Chris Sarandon – Dracula
Over three decades after starring as Jerry Dandrige in Fright Night, Chris Sarandon returned to his vampiric roots to portray the ultimate blood sucker: Count Dracula. He plays an integral role in season 5’s four-part Monster & Mutants arc, first appearing (albeit without dialogue) in “The Curse of Savanti Romero.”
Dracula is one of the creatures recruited by time-traveling sorcerer Savanti Romero to take over the world, along with Frankenstein’s Monster, Vulko the werewolf, and The Pharaoh mummy. Dracula plans to betray Savanti, but Michelangelo destroys him before he has the chance.
8. Dana DeLorenzo – Esmeralda
No stranger to being surrounded by monsters after three seasons of Ash vs Evil Dead, Dana DeLorenzo can be heard alongside Sarandon in “The Crypt of Dracula.” She plays Esmeralda, the daughter of Vulko the werewolf. The Romanian traveler shares her knowledge of monsters with the Turtles.
DeLorenzo’s Ash vs Evil Dead co-star Lucy Lawless voices Daagon supreme ruler Hiidrala in season 4’s “The Cosmic Ocean.”
9. Danny Trejo – Newtralizer
Machete don’t text, but he does voices. Genre favorite Danny Trejo plays Newtralizer (also known as K’Vathrak), a Salamandrian bounty hunter who will stop at nothing to eradicate the Kraang — even if that means taking out innocent humans and the Turtles.
The character first appears in Season 1’s “Operation: Break Out,” in which he breaks out of his cell and Donnie gives him his nickname. Trejo came in to play him in season 2’s “Newtralized,” briefly teaming up with Feldman’s Slash in an episode loaded with Star Wars references, and later returning in season 5’s two-part “When Worlds Collide,” where he has the newfound ability to wield electricity.
10. James Hong – Ho Chan
James Hong has over 600 credits — from Blade Runner to Seinfeld to Kung Fu Panda to Everything Everywhere All at Once — but horror fans will always associate him with Lo Pan from Big Trouble in Little China. He plays a similar role in TMNT’s Big Trouble homage, “A Chinatown Ghost Story,” in Season 2.
Hong voices the villainous Ho Chan, an ancient ghost sorcerer who even borrows a line from ol’ Jack Burton, “It’s all in the reflexes.” While the Turtles ultimately defeat him, he vows to return at the end of the episode. He does so in season 5’s “End Times,” but this time around Splinter ensures it’s the last of him.
11. Robert Englund – Dire Beaver / Dread Beaver
Robert Englund is, of course, best known for his work in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. When TMNT drew inspiration from the horror classic for season 5’s “In Dreams,” they called on Freddy Krueger himself to provide a voice.
Englund voices Dire Beaver and Dread Beaver, two of the four interdimensional Dream Beavers that trap the Turtles in their dreams. The episode features several nods to Freddy, including the beavers’ long claws, a musical cue reminiscent of the Elm Street theme, and a nightmare involving a furnace.
12. John Kassir – Dark Beaver / Dave Beaver
Along with Englund in “In Dreams,” the other two Dream Beavers — Dark Beaver and Dave Beaver — are played by John Kassir. He has over 250 credits to his name, the majority of which are voice roles, but his unmistakable pipes are best known for Tales from the Crypt‘s ghoulish host, the Crypt Keeper.
13. Bill Moseley – Bernie
Would you believe there’s a third horror icon in “In Dreams?” Bill Moseley — known for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2, House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil’s Rejects, and Night of the Living Dead — plays Bernie in the same episode.
A physicist-turned-grocer, Bernie has stayed awake for decades to prevent the Dream Beavers from attacking our world. His weapon of choice is a chainsaw with “The Saw is Family” engraved on the blade, in reference to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III.
The character later makes a photo cameo later in season 3 in “Dinosaur Seen in Sewers,” where he’s featured on a tabloid with the headline “Man did not sleep for 40 years.”
14. Lance Henriksen – Zog
With credits including The Terminator, Aliens, Near Dark, Scream 3, and Pumpkinhead, Lance Henriksen is an undisputed genre legend. He lends his talents to TMNT as Zog, a character that was originally created for the comics and previously appeared in the 2003 animated series.
Zog appears in season 3’s “Dinosaur Seen in Sewers” as a scout who plans to signal his fellow Triceratons to attack the Earth in order to destroy the Kraang – until the Turtles get involved, that is. He refuses Raphael’s attempt to save his life, instead opting to plummet to his death.
15. Michael Ironside – Emperor Zanmoran
Michael Ironside brings a signature gravitas to all of his projects, from Total Recall, Starship Troopers, and Scanners to Terminator Salvation, Turbo Kid, and TMNT, in which he plays Emperor Zanmoran.
Although he only appears in one episode – Season 4’s “The Arena of Carnage” – Zanmoran is a pivotal foe whose presence can be felt throughout the season’s space arc. Zanmoran serves as the sadistic leader of the Triceraton Empire and commander of their armada.
Some of the many other recognizable voices that pop up throughout the series include Sean Astin as Raphael, Seth Green as Leonardo, Clancy Brown as Rahzar, David Tennant as The Fugitoid, Mark Hamill as Kavaxas, Jesse Ventura as The Finger, Paul Reubens as Sir Malachi, and TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman as Ice Cream Kitty.
Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Series is available on DVD. Select seasons are streaming Netflix and Paramount+.

2023-07-26 04:30:01-07:00,5 movies you need to watch in August 2023,"From an animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot to a comedy about profane canines, these 5 movies are the ones to watch in August 2023.","Last year, the movie industry was on shaky ground. The COVID recovery was still in its earliest stages, and while there were hits like Top Gun: Maverick, there were fewer movies actually showing in theaters. Worst of all was the month of August, when only one big Hollywood movie, the mediocre action comedy Bullet Train, was released.
What a difference a year makes. In August 2023, Hollywood has packed the slate with a diverse selection of movies ranging from a comic book movie (the sure-to-fail DC Comics movie Blue Beetle), a video game adaptation (Gran Turismo), and the usual mixture of action movies, thrillers, and comedies. Here are the five best movies you should check out in August, and why they are worth going to the movies to see.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (August 2)
It’s been only a relatively brief time since the last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, which means it’s time for another reboot. Seven years after Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, Paramount has gone back to the drawing board and switched to the format that served the characters best in the first place: animation.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will be the second theatrical animated Turtles movie, but unlike the generic CGI look of the 2007 film TMNT, Mutant Mayhem sports unique visuals that are clearly inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. That’s not a bad thing, as long as Mutant Mayhem remembers why the Turtles worked in the first place. Judging by its two trailers, which emphasize the characters’ youthfulness, quippy humor, and copious pizza eating, as well as the bizarre villains, it looks like Mutant Mayhem will be another successful revival in the Turtles’ long pop culture history.
Passages (August 4)
Summer movies are more than just big explosions and fights with aliens; they can also be about watching extremely attractive people getting it on. Ira Sachs’ NC-17 rated drama Passages promises to fill that quota with a sexy tale of a love triangle gone terribly wrong. The film stars German actor Franz Rogowski as Tomas, a filmmaker in a happy and stable marriage to Martin (No Time to Die‘s Ben Whishaw). One night in a crowded dance club, he meets Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos), a young schoolteacher who ignites a lust in Tomas that surprises even him. Soon, Tomas and Agathe begin an affair, which jeopardizes Tomas’ marriage to Martin, who begins his own affair.
Erotic dramas used to be a staple of summertime moviegoing; remember Unfaithful, the Adrian Lyne movie that came out in May 2002 and nabbed star Diane Lane an Oscar nomination for Best Actress? Passages may not have as much of a mainstream appeal as that movie, but early reviews indicate it’s as thought-provoking and sensual as its intriguing trailer suggests. If nothing else, Passages understands the universal appeal of beautiful people suffering melodramatically over love, something which you just can’t get in an MCU movie or the latest Mission: Impossible entry.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter (August 11)
Does the world need another Dracula adaptation? Probably not, especially after April’s disappointing comedic take on the legendary vampire, Renfield. But Bram Stoker’s creation is endlessly adaptable, and Universal’s new take on the classic monster, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, isn’t your ordinary tale of the eternal bloodsucker from Transylvania.
For starters, there’s no Renfield, Jonathan Harker, Mina, Lucy, or Van Helsing; instead, the movie, which adapts “The Captain’s Log” chapter in Dracula, takes place almost entirely on a ship with a motley crew of sailors, prisoners, and other assorted vagabonds. It’s here where Dracula strikes, not as a debonair human-looking man, but as a grotesque, winged creature desperate to feed. The Last Voyage of the Demeter leans into the horror, with the trailer promising all kinds of gore and bloodshed, and it may be the first Dracula adaptation in a long while to actually be truly terrifying.
Strays (August 18)
Strays | Official Trailer [HD]
Remember Homeward Bound, that innocent Disney movie from 1993 that featured live-action footage of animals voiced by well-known stars like Sally Field? It wasn’t anything groundbreaking, but Homeward Bound was a good movie for kids not yet touched by cynicism and parents who wanted to relive their youth. Well, Strays promises to take a piss on all those sweet memories with its foul-mouthed canines.
The movie, a live-action film featuring four talking poochies voiced by an all-star cast that includes Barbie’s Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, is a hard R-rated take on a normally G-rated premise: a group of animals go out on a adventure and must rely on each other to overcome obstacles in the big, bad world. Strays is far more filthier and funnier, with these anamorphic dogs cursing, getting into fights, and tripping on mushrooms. Strays is a movie for anyone who wonders what their dog really thinks of them and suspects they really don’t much like their owner or humans at all.
Bottoms (August 25)
BOTTOMS | Official Red Band Trailer
After No Hard Feelings in June and Joyride in July, Raunchy Girl Summer concludes with Emma Seligman’s Bottoms, a delightfully filthy comedy that won over audiences at South by Southwest earlier this year. The movie features rising stars Rachel Sennott (who also co-wrote the film) and The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri as PJ and Josie, two queer teenagers who are too dorky and socially awkward to get dates with the high school cheerleaders they lust after. They decide to form an all-girls fight club to gain the attention of their objects of affection. Naturally, things don’t go quite as planned, and hijinks ensue.
Described by Seligman as “a campy queer high school comedy in the vein of Wet Hot American Summer, but more for a Gen-Z queer audience,” Bottoms dials up the awkward humor and doesn’t flinch from portraying its central female protagonists as desperate, horny, and funny as hell. The movie’s rapturous reception at SXSW, combined with its hilarious trailers, promises to close out the summer of 2023 with a few well-earned laughs … and maybe a life lesson or two as well.

,"Seth Rogen, director Jeff Rowe talk about their vision for ‘Mutant Mayhem’","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles made a big impression on Seth Rogen at a very early age. “The animated series came out in 1987, when I was five. The first movie came out in 1990, when I was eight,” he says.","Seth Rogen, director Jeff Rowe talk about their vision for ‘Mutant Mayhem’
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles made a big impression on Seth Rogen at a very early age. “The animated series came out in 1987, when I was five. The first movie came out in 1990, when I was eight,” he says.
“It was perfectly geared toward someone my age and I loved it. They were funny. They were referential. I started taking karate probably because of the Turtles. I was just kind of obsessed.”
So when Brian Robbins, President and CEO of Paramount and Nickelodeon, called Rogen to ask him if he’d like to discuss making a new Turtles movie, Rogen already knew exactly what he wanted to do.
“It’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” Rogen says. “Of all those words, the teenage part was the most under-explored, and the most interesting to me.”
And that is how “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem”, in Philippine cinemas August 23, began. Rogen saw in it a Turtles movie made with a genuine teen spirit – breaking all the rules, ripping up the playbook and doing everything on its own terms.
To help shape a Turtles movie with the wit and verve they wanted, Rogen, his producing partner Evan Goldberg, and Mutant Mayhem producer James Weaver needed a director who could tell a story full of heart and humor, but who was also not afraid to break the rules. They were pointed in the direction – by Phil Lord and Chris Miller no less – of one man: Jeff Rowe, co-writer and co-director of “The Mitchells Vs. The Machines.”

Rowe admits that he didn’t need all that much in the way of persuading. As a professed lifelong Turtles fan, when he heard there was a search on for a director for a new version of them, his head started spinning. “I thought, ‘That sounds like a dream project. I would kill to do that,’” Rowe says.

Rowe and his producers all agreed on the direction for the story, which would consider the siblings teenagers first, turtles second. But then Rowe wanted to push the concept even further. What if the movie about teenagers looked like it was made by teenagers? “When he first pitched it,” laughs Goldberg, “we said, ‘Maybe…I don’t know, man. It sounds a little crazy.’”

It probably was a little crazy, at least at first. Rowe’s idea was that he wanted to make a movie that looked not slick and polished – like most CG movies – but as messy, fun and unpredictable as the story’s heroes.

“We just wanted it to look like teenage drawings,” says Rowe. “You know, the kind of drawings you did when you were in high school that have weird shapes and bad perspective but are lovingly rendered in places. And were always sincere.”

As the Turtles co-creator and a man who has seen them transform so many times over the years, Kevin Eastman couldn’t be more happy with what everyone has achieved with Mutant Mayhem. “It’s big and loud and proud,” he says. “These guys nailed it.”

In “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem”, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.

The film exceeded expectations and took in $43 million at the U.S. box office on its first five days, an impressive feat for the $70 million production. The film has also opened in a few international markets, earning a global total of $51.3 million.

The animated feature, which has been well-received by critics and moviegoers alike, currently has a 96% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a stellar A CinemaScore from audiences.

“We’re over the moon with this opening.” Chris Aronson, Paramount’s Domestic Distribution Boss, told Deadline. “We exceeded pre-release expectations with this movie which has been a labor of love for a long time.”

This latest version features a star-studded voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Rose Byrne, Hannibal Buress, John Cena, Ice Cube, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph. The titular teenage mutant ninja turtles are voiced by real teenagers Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vdGhlLWZyZWVtYW4vY2VidS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjMvMDgvMjEvMjI5MDI4MS9zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLWRpcmVjdG9yLWplZmYtcm93ZS10YWxrLWFib3V0LXRoZWlyLXZpc2lvbi1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVt0gGTAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS90aGUtZnJlZW1hbi9jZWJ1LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMy8wOC8yMS8yMjkwMjgxL3NldGgtcm9nZW4tZGlyZWN0b3ItamVmZi1yb3dlLXRhbGstYWJvdXQtdGhlaXItdmlzaW9uLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-07 11:00:01-04:00,So You Want to Read TMNT Comics? – Prologue,"The turtles are back in the zeitgeist, if they ever left, and Multiversity is here to help readers new and old find the right comics to read, in the right order. But first, a quick prologue and primer.","Picture this. You, or your kid, or your parent, or your friend, has just watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. You’re jazzed. You’re looking for more. Maybe you go find the other movie, maybe the other TV shows, or maybe, and that’s why you’re here, you want to read the comics they’re based on. To do that, you need a reading order because there’s nothing that goes together better than reading orders and comics.

Except maybe pizza and cowabunga.

But where do you start? That’s a surprisingly tricky question with a tricky answer. There are a lot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” series, some intertwined, some not. Looking to read every issue? Or just the “Mirage Continuity” ones? What about the current ongoing series from IDW? Do you start with “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Reborn” or jump back to the start?

Then there’s the appropriateness of the content. Contrary to what the 80s would have you believe, the comics run the gamut of ratings. Are you looking for family-friendly? Read “TMNT Adventures”. Something with a little more edge but still fine for 13 year olds? IDW’s relaunch. Way more edge than that? Volume 3 aka the “Urban Legends.”

Finally, and most crucially, there’s the accessibility of these books. Do you find the single issues? Or maybe trades or omnibi? What about digital access?

And I’m sure you’re wondering by now: Elias, what in Splinter’s name are you doing writing another “TMNT” comic reading order? They already exist! In droves! Here’s one from Comic Book Herald. And another from TMNT Entity (more on this one later. For good and for ill.) And yet another from the TMNT Wiki. And, you guessed it, another from reddit’s TMNT Wiki (who knows how long this one will be around.) And one more for good measure from How to Love Comics.

You’re right. This is a silly exercise. For most use-cases, those other reading orders are wonderful. And yet, here I am, writing this column. Why? Because when I decided to educate myself on all things teenage, mutant, ninja, and turtle a couple years ago, I ran into an issue.

Specifically, I ran into a lack of issues.

No matter where I looked, or what list I checked, I could not find a complete (and correct) list that answered the questions above, most specifically where to find the dang things. As a completionist at heart, this was a great disappointment to discover. You’d think that for a franchise as popular as “TMNT,” all the comics would be in perpetual print, collected era by era, series by series. Maybe even in some kind of “complete collection.”

That would be wishful thinking.

A (brief) history

See, “TMNT” has had a varied and strange publishing life. It began as a self-published black and white parody of Frank Miller comics co-written and co-drawn by two guys, Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. Once it blew up, the comic (now multi-media property) became the lynchpin of Mirage Comics, their publishing company, with one-shots and short stories and supplemental series. Soon, those comics were being drawn and written by a cavalcade of talent that sometimes, but not always, included the original two creators. A brief list of notable highlights or consistent creators includes: Michael Dooney, Jim Lawson, Dave Sim, Rich Veitch, Steve Bissette, Ryan Brown, and Eric Talbot. The issues remained in B&W in the singles but most got colored and collected as well.

We’ll come back to why these two points are important in a minute.

Eventually the first volume ended, was renumbered, then ended again a short while later. Alongside that was the family-friendly color version based on the cartoon published by Archie comics, a couple short lived spin-offs, and a syndicated newspaper strip, though not from Archie Comics. They, too, ended. Things then moved over to Image comics, where everyone took a turn for the gritted teeth and shock plot swerves and unceremoniously crashed and burned before ever finishing its story.

There’s also a short chapter where Dreamwave publishing got the rights to adapt the 2003 edition of the cartoon. Don’t worry about that one.

At the turn of the millennium, Mirage took the title back in earnest, and launched volume 4, this time without co-creator Eastman (as he sold his stake in the venture to Laird.) Added wrinkle: this is technically volume 3 since it ignores everything that Image did. Eventually, Viacom purchases the whole venture (TMNT, not Mirage) from Laird and while he was allowed to keep publishing volume 4 under Mirage Comics, only three more issues came out after the sale and thus Volume 4 is still, technically, ongoing.

Continued below

This brings us to present day, where IDW has been publishing their own continuity of stories, complete with spin-offs. They also colored and re-released volume 3 from Image under a new name – Urban Legends – and finally completed the series. And published adaptations of each new cartoon iteration, of course. Gotta keep the synergy machine running.

Editor’s Note: Want to read some interviews with creatives from those eras, including co-creator Kevin Eastman? Check out our 30 Years of TMNT series from the 30th anniversary.

Back to my conundrum

Because of the many companies, many eras, and many disparate titles, there isn’t just one set of trades and no easy chronology within, or across, each iteration. That’s part for the course on “Daredevil” or “Batman” but for an indie title of this prominence, it’s quite the rarity. And then there’re the two added wrinkles that make any complete read-through a real bear of a time.

Remember how I mentioned that in the original run of comics they had a variety of creators working on the book, later to be called “The Guest Era?” And that they collected the black & white stories in both B&W and in color? These factors meant that when IDW put out new trades, they had decisions to make and constraints to adhere to. The solution? Kinda, sorta group issues by creator instead of sequentially and then also by their printing status: original B&W or recolored (be the colors brand new or from the first trades.)

This led to three or four different but similarly named lines existing and a doubling or tripling up of certain issues while skipping others. Additionally, a number of those original issues have never been reprinted or collected at all, notably the Rich Veitch written ones, and while there are B&W and color versions of the Eastman & Laird led issues, we only have the color versions available for most of the rest (as of writing.)

For the vast majority of people, that second part is probably not an issue. Who cares as long as you can read it? It is, however, frustrating for someone like me who wants to have a consistent reading experience and has been burned by colored black & white comics before. It also royally pisses off the preservationist in me since it means those comics, which were conceived of and drawn for black & white, may be lost forever in their original form if they aren’t properly preserved.

The rights issues are a pain but at least they are understandable. Veitch didn’t want to give up ownership when Viacom (now Paramount) decided that buying creators out instead of sharing royalties was the simple solution, thereby changing the deal he had with Mirage, Sim actually owns Cerberus, and any other crossovers are the purview of other publishers/creators. Still, it sucks as a modern-day reader and double sucks for the comprehensive one.

To find the goldilocks of “TMNT” reading orders is a fool’s errand. There never will be one. Something will always have to give. But by the ooze, I’m gonna try my hardest to make one that connects readers to the issues as easily and comprehensively as possible, no matter how you like to read. To be a sign-post pointing the way. And to maybe have a little fun in the sewers of NYC and the streets of Westchester. No spreadsheet wizardry required.

Goongala!

2023-08-02 21:00:09+00:00,A Dang Good Review of Dang Brother Pizza,Dang Brother Pizza creates a new and unique pie every Saturday in their wood-fired oven crafted from a vintage firetruck.,"Food Reviews

Originally a mobile catering service from San Diego, Dang Brother Pizza expanded to Utah this year as an innovative new food truck. Making their first appearance at the Winter Market in Ogden, Dang Brother is back this summer with exciting menu items and a brand-new oven crafted from a vintage fire truck. With the promise of wood-fired pizza made from scratch, my friends and I were off to Farmers Market Ogden to try this unique experience for ourselves.

The smell of smoke carried us to the far east end of the bustling market to the second-to-last stand. Though the line was long, it moved fast, with a friendly young lad quickly taking orders and stealing time for jokes and chatter with customers. We ordered three wood-fired pizzas, each made to order in a 900-degree oven right at their tent.

The smell of smoke carried us to the far east end of the bustling market to the second-to-last stand. Though the line was long, it moved fast, with a friendly young lad quickly taking orders and stealing time for jokes and chatter with customers.

We tried the Sexy Pepperoni ($14), the Utah ($16) and the Farmer’s Special ($18), the last of which changes frequently as Dang Brother works with other vendors at the local market to curate a new, unique pizza every Saturday. We waited about 15 minutes for our three pizzas, which were all made from scratch—seriously, this guy was throwing dough right there in the tent!

We started out with the Utah pizza, which consisted of an olive oil garlic base topped with mozzarella, bacon, french fries, red onion, cilantro, parmesan and a drizzle of their house-made fry sauce. The pizza dough was warm and chewy with the perfect amount of char on each bite. The bacon was the standout star, but it wasn’t overpowering due to the balance of zesty fry sauce and crispy french fries. This pizza was especially savory and filling.

Next, we tried the Farmer’s Special. This week, it had an olive oil garlic base with red onions, roasted broccoli, bacon, mushrooms and feta cheese. This one had my friends and I wondering why broccoli isn’t used more as a pizza topping. The crunch from the broccoli and red onions was the perfect contrast to the gooey cheese and meaty mushrooms. My only complaint with this pizza is that I wouldn’t be able to order it every weekend, but it piqued my curiosity for the different combinations coming next!

Finally, we finished off with the Sexy Pepperoni, an enhanced version of your average pepperoni pizza. It starts off with a standard marinara base topped with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, parmesan and feta. I don’t know what it was that made this pizza so Dang good, but it was the group favorite by far! The marinara sauce was full of flavor and complimented the charred, wood-fired crust. Sweet and acidic, it was balanced by the savory pepperonis and sharp feta pieces.

Each of us stuffed to the brim, we still had extra slices to take home and enjoy later. When the pizza is made to order and filled with fresh, unique ingredients, $12–18 per pizza is a great value. Take the time to check out Dang Brother Pizza at Farmers Market Ogden every Saturday this summer. Don’t live in Ogden? You can also check out Dang Brother at the Sunset City Farmers Market on Tuesdays from 5–9 p.m. or on Wednesdays at the Roy Community Farmers Market from 5–8 p.m.



Be sure to grab a slice from Dang Brother Pizza on Sunday, August 13 at the Craft Lake City DIY Festival. I promise you’ll have a Dang good time!

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Stranger Things #1 interior reveals that the Turtles will appear as they did in the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book series published by Mirage Studios in what seems like a nod to Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird creating the Turtles around the same time that Stranger Things is set. You can see the artwork below.

Cameron Chittock (Mapmakers) writes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Stranger Things with Fero Pe, who has worked on IDW's ongoing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, providing the artwork. Here's the synopsis for the series:

""Eleven, Max, Dustin, Mike, Will, and Lucas are looking forward to a nonthreatening, fun-filled trip to New York City. With the gang hundreds of miles from the otherworldly weirdness of their hometown, they're sure to catch a break this time…or at least that's what they think until they encounter a threat both bizarre and familiar. To face that threat, they must unite with a fearsome fighting team every bit as bizarre…but green!""

In the press release announcing the series, Chittock said, ""I've loved the Ninja Turtles for quite literally as long as I can remember, and part of the brilliant alchemy of Stranger Things is that, ever since that first binge, it's felt like it's always been there. That's a testament to Eastman, Laird, and the Duffer brothers who tell stories that grab hold of you and don't let go. Bringing their creations together is a surreal thrill, and we're striving to fill every issue with moments worthy of their lofty standards. I can't wait for fans to join us in 1985 to find out what's lurking underneath New York.""

Pe added, ""It feels incredible to be the artist of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Stranger Things. For the art on this project, I wanted to do something unique, inspired by the era when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created and the setting of the Stranger Things series. It's a style close to the first Turtles comics from Mirage. I hope that the fans of both worlds enjoy it very much!""

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Stranger Things #1 releases on July 12h. The series is running alongside another Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book crossover from IDW Publishing, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles vs. Street Fighter. Official solicitation information and preview pages for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Stranger Things #1 follow.

,"Before they went full Hollywood, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles broke the mold in Northampton","With a little sleuthing, you can still see traces of their origins around town — before you see the new TMNT movie, ‘Mutant Mayhem.’","Growing up, my go-tos on my monthly visits to the comics shop That’s Entertainment in my hometown of Worcester were Batman, Spider-Man, X-Men, and . . . the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who are about to hit the big screen again in the Seth Rogen-produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” out Aug. 2.

That’s one of the most frequently asked questions I get from young readers when touring the country with my graphic novels. The answer isn’t binary for me, because my allegiances were always character-specific.

Of course neither Marvel nor DC created the Ninja Turtles: They were the brainchild of a small indie publisher, Mirage Studios, which was located in Northampton.

Growing up in Worcester, Northampton felt like another world, despite being just an hour west. When I declared to my grandparents that I would be settling in “Hamp,” they looked at me as if I were leaving for California. Would they even have a Dunkin’ Donuts there?

The Ninja Turtles’ connection to Northampton literally put the mysterious city on the map for me; I now make it my home.

As the legend goes, the heroes in a half-shell were born out of a brainstorming session between Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creators Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. They were goofing off in their Dover, N.H., apartment when Eastman drew a masked turtle brandishing nunchucks. The two went back and forth, entertaining one another with their sketches, when Laird added the words “Teenage Mutant.” This was at the tail end of 1983. The duo self-published 3,000 black-and-white copies of “Eastman and Laird’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” issue #1 under the banner Mirage Studios, and the response was . . . bodacious, basically the early ‘80s version of “going viral.”

The first few issues were successful enough for Eastman and Laird to move their operation out of their shared apartment and into an office space in Northampton, building a team to help meet the demand for the comics. The original run of the Ninja Turtles indie comics was dark and edgy: It would be unrecognizable to fans whose entry points into the TMNT world were the playful animated TV series or ubiquitous Playmates Toys line.

This mass media push introduced the greater world to the Turtles via their infectious theme song: Leonardo (“leads”), Donatello (“does machines”), Raphael (“is cool but rude”), and Michelangelo (“is a party dude”). The four brothers were trained in ninjutsu by their adoptive father, a mutated rat named Splinter, in the sewers of New York City.

Eastman and Laird profoundly impacted me as a young artist in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Their work showed me that you could have a successful, creator-owned comic book character — a different fate than what befell the creators of Superman, who had lost rights to their characters without proper compensation.

When I entered double-digits, I blew into my “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” game cartridge and played my Nintendo Entertainment System until I defeated the top boss. I sat in the theater on the opening weekend of the 1990 live-action movie. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” was a fun and gritty film with the boys in green brought to life by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.

Inspired, I spent my time drawing fan art and producing stop-motion animated videos with Ninja Turtle action figures. I found childhood drawings in my mother’s house after she died. She and I were separated for the majority of my youth, as she was incarcerated. We had a tradition of mailing one another cartoon drawings, a ritual I wrote about in my graphic memoir “Hey, Kiddo.”

While the first TMNT live-action film was successful, parents weren’t so happy about its dark undertones and violence — and executives wanted to sell Happy Meals. The Ninja Turtles got a cameo by Vanilla Ice in 1991′s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,” introducing his earworm “Ninja Rap.”

Sitting in the movie theater (again), I was less enthralled than the first time around. Then came “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,” and I wished I could travel back in time like the Turtles — and not buy that movie ticket. Don’t even get me started on the live-action stage show, sponsored by Pizza Hut, in which the Turtles formed a rock band and toured the country with the “Coming Out of Their Shells Tour.”

I can suspend my disbelief that mutant turtles are training as ninjas in the sewers of New York City — but mutant turtles that wear denim vests and play the keytar? That’s where I draw the line.

By the time I settled in Northampton in 2006, Eastman had sold his shares of TMNT to Laird, and Eastman’s famed Words & Pictures Museum of Fine Sequential Art, a fixture of downtown Northampton, had closed. Turtlemania may have peaked in the early 1990s, but I was still giddy to know that my new hometown was where it had all started. In 2009, Laird sold off the rights to all things TMNT to Viacom, opting for a quieter existence. Turtle Power had left Northampton.

Over the years, several attempts have been made to resurrect Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael — in addition to a CGI-animated movie, titled “TMNT” (2007), there have been multiple animated shows. Nickelodeon made a popular animated series, and Paramount put out a live-action reboot with roided-up Turtles courtesy of Michael Bay. I could barely get through the trailer.

But we may be at the precipice of a true comeback. Eastman became an active writer and illustrator on the comics line again starting in 2011 — the prodigal son had returned to the Turtles! And I have high hopes that “Mutant Mayhem” will bring back the world of the Turtles in a meaningful way.

Designed by artist Woodrow White, the animation has the aesthetics of a punk-rock painting. The spirit seems to capture both the fun campiness of the animated series and the grittiness of the original comics.

And after all these years, it’s the first film adaptation that will focus on the teenage aspects of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Just as Charles Schulz cast real kids to voice Charlie Brown and the gang, real teenagers were cast to voice these teen Turtles. I look forward to seeing the movie with my kids with the same anticipation I feel when I bring them to Easthampton’s Comics N’ More shop to browse the spinner racks. As Vanilla Ice once proclaimed, “Go ninja, go ninja, go!”

Downtown Northampton still has a few reminders of the Ninja Turtles’ origins. They feature in a mural at 135 Main St., and four TMNT-themed sewer tops are coming to town. I also included the Turtles in a mural I painted at Forbes Library, which celebrates various book characters created by authors and artists from around the Pioneer Valley.

Still, the truest relics of Turtlemania are visible at the former site of the Words & Pictures Museum. When outside the R. Michelson Galleries on Main Street, look up above the AT&T store. You will spot stone Ninja Turtle-like gargoyles adorning the facade — like ancient Greek statues reminding you of the empire that once stood.

Comics creators, if they’re lucky, create characters that live on. I often wonder what will become of Lunch Lady, the star of my kids’ graphic novel series. (The spatula-wielding superhero features in a mural at Logan Airport.) I know what a character can mean to a comics-obsessed kid, how drawing fan art can inspire your imagination, and how the panels of a comic book can offer an escape into a fantastical fictional world.

2023-08-13 14:55:00+00:00,Greta Gerwig Breaks Global & US Box Office Records For Female Director With ‘Barbie’; Why ‘Demeter’ Deep-Sixed – Sunday Update,"'Barbie' crosses half-billion mark in U.S., while 'Last Voyage of the Demeter' bombs. Greta Gerwig is top grossing female director U.S. of all-time, best for live-action pic worldwide all-time","SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU after Saturday AM update: The momentum of Barbenheimer, as well as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and The Meg 2: The Trench, are propelling a significantly better August than a year ago. The weekend is set to top an estimated $118.5M, +76% from the same frame in 2022 per industry sources.

THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER , Universal Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection

Unfortunately, the tanking of Amblin/Universal’s $45M-costing The Last Voyage of the Demeter stands out like a wart, since we haven’t had many misfires this summer. Granted, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s profitability might be in question next to their exorbitant Covid costs. But these pics have put up tentpole grosses in the nine digits, and have been mass draws (just not as massive as they were hoped to be). Note the filmmakers aimed to keep this period horror pic as cheap as they could: Exteriors were shot in Malta, while interior were shot in Germany, both those countries respectively having tax credits of 50% and 30%.

What makes the $6.5M opening here for Demeter more pronounced is simply given the fact that it’s the only major studio-wide entry this weekend. Note, we’ve known due to tracking that this vampire ship pic was headed for the cliffs.

Look, Amblin makes these elevated genre mid-budget size movies, not necessarily as thrifty as Blumhouse. There was Captive State, which was made for $25M and was released pre-spring 2019 and fell down with a global gross less than $9M. Amblin had some money in that film, but it was largely financed by Participant.

Then there was the under-$10M horror pic, Come Play, which was released when major movie capitals like NYC and L.A. weren’t opened. That grossed $13.1M WW, and I’m told it broke even thanks to vibrant PVOD during the pandemic, and everyone watching at home. Demeter will have to look to the saving grace of downstream ancillaries. Remember, if there’s anything that theatrical day-and-date taught us, it’s that it’s always better to release theatrically, prop the pic’s profile, bomb, and make money thereafter.

Sitting in a movie theater this summer and watching a rhythmic flow of riveting trailers, including not just Barbie and Oppenheimer, but also Sony’s upcoming (what looks-to-be hysterical) holiday romantic comedy, Anyone But You, starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell — then the trailer for Demeter hits the screen and screeches all fun to a halt. What is this overly dark Master and Commander clipper ship type movie? ‘What’s a Demeter?’ one asks. Then two minutes into the trailer, just before you’re about to doze off, one’s response is ‘Oh, it’s about Dracula.’ That was one of the biggest problems I found in the marketing: The trailer was a huge ‘do-not-see-this-movie,’ especially with the non-starry cast (another hurdle for this horror pic).

However, this movie is from the genius marketing team who turned M3GAN into a phenomenon when the country was in a deep-freeze this past winter, and whenever a trailer can’t deliver, it’s because there aren’t enough materials in the film for a studio’s marketing team to harness. It’s not marketing’s fault, it’s the film’s fault. At the end of the day, period horror is a hurdle, as it’s too elevated to excite core 18-34 horror fans, and too low bar to pull in sophisticated audiences — even if you have stars (case in point Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak –$13.1M opening, $31M domestic on a $55M production cost). Filmmaker André Øvredal was able to delight back in early August 2019 with a PG-13 young adult movie, Scary Stories (which by the way, it’s set in 1968, which isn’t as period for a horror movie and a turnoff as clipper ship times).

There is a feeling by some close to the film that the studio got cold feet in propping Demeter this summer. However, audience diagnostics are diagnostics coming out of testing, and marketing budgets are appropriately allocated to those stats as studios look to keep a low overhead on a feature heading into the streaming window.

There were champions of Demeter who tried to get the good word out, i.e. del Toro and Stephen King, who praised the pic on social media:

I enjoyed Last Voyage of the Demeter so much: gorgeous, lavish and savage!! — Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) August 10, 2023



I was doubtful about THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER, but it's a throat-ripping good time. It reminded me of the best of the Hammer movies from the 60s and 70s. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) August 10, 2023

In addition to critics who aren’t fans of Demeter, audiences are asleep, too, with a B- CinemaScore and 66% positive on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak. Guys bought tickets at 62%, 52% of the 18-34 demo was present, and 25-34 year olds were the largest quad at 32%. Diversity mix was 44% Caucasian, 25% Latino and Hispanic, 16% Black, and 16% Asian/other. Demeter played strongest in the South, South Central and West. The annual income for a part-time entry level worker at McDonalds is higher than what this movie made at the AMC Burbank since Thursday (Demeter‘s highest grossing venue) which is under $12.5K so far.

There’s no need for the studio to use the excuse that stars weren’t available to promote because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, for it remains to be seen whether or not they would have moved the meter on this title. The pic’s problems are inherent. As Deadline film critic Valerie Complex points out about Demeter, “The visual palette drenched in melancholic grays and blues are effective in creating atmosphere, but the film falls prey to predictability.” She also observes that her journey on the Demeter “feels longer than it actually is.”

Furthermore, Universal did push Demeter as much as they could. The pic trailered on movies like Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible in-theaters. The trailer trended #10 on YouTube, generated 90+ press breaks, and garnered more than 61M views. Spots ran on such TV shows as American Ninja Warrior, America’s Got Talent, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia finale, Mayans finale, The Walking Dead: Dead City finale, Shark Week, Big Brother premiere, and The Challenge premiere. On streaming, spots ran on such shows as The Bear, What We Do in the Shadows and Only Murders in the Building.

In the sports arena, Demeter floated into a UFC 291 PPV sponsorship (including coveted spot right before the match begins, lower thirds, billboards, announcer callouts), NBA Finals Games 2&5, MLB All-Star Game, WWE RAW, League’s Cup, All Elite Wrestling: Rampage, Boxing PPV Spence v. Crawford Sponsorship, UFC Fight Night, NFL Hall of Game. While on streaming, the campaign also had placements in NBC’s NFL streaming coverage and a sponsorship of Peacock’s WWE Summer Slam.

Despite all noble efforts here by Uni — no one’s buying tickets for a trip on the Demeter. Amblin’s linear cable deal is with Showtime, so Demeter won’t end up on Peacock. Onward to PVOD, Ho!

Some trivia: Sony’s Gran Turismo, which was suppose to come out this weekend but was pushed to Aug. 25 because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, has been playing sneaks, just like the Culver City lot promised. I’m told there were Imax early access screenings on Wednesday, regular sneaks on Thursday. Today, there’s a 2 PM at the Regal North Hollywood, LA Live, and TCL Chinese Theatre. Where will the extra money be counted? I understand it will be in the end-running total. The Playstation Studios movie opened abroad with $10.7M from 4,900+ screens in 30 markets. France led all markets with a strong $2.3 million, followed by the UK with $1.3 million. Australia and Germany both launched with $1.0 million.

The chart is updating with Sunday figures, indicated by Saturday and Sunday figures:

1 Barbie (WB) 4,178 theaters – Fri $10M (-38%) Sat $13.2M Sun $10.5M, 3-day $33.7M (-36%), Total $526.3M/Wk 4

Pic’s Imax weekend is $5.5M raising its total in the large format’s theaters to $75.8M. That’s the highest ever IMAX Domestic result for a Nolan title, as well as the 4th highest IMAX Domestic result of all time.

3) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Par) 3,950 theaters (+92), Fri $4M (-56%), Sat $6.3M Sun $5.4M 3-day $15.7M (-44%), Total $72.7M/Wk 2

10) Jailer (Indin) 450 theaters, Fri $774K Sat $995K Sun $731K 3-day $2.5M Total $4.1M/Wk 1

This action comedy in126 markets put up some big numbers in Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco, Austin, NYC, Chicago and LA.

FRIDAY EVENING: We told you earlier the Greta Gerwig directed Barbie is crossing $500M today. As of Tuesday, the film became the highest ever at the domestic box office for a female director, besting Frozen II‘s $477.4M, which was co-directed by Jennifer Lee. Barbie is crossing $1.13 billion worldwide today, also delivering another box office record to Gerwig, as the pic became the highest grossing live-action pic from a female filmmaker on a global basis, besting Captain Marvel‘s $1.13 billion, that title co-directed by Anna Boden.

Barbie crosses the half billion point stateside in 22 days, faster than Top Gun: Maverick (30 days) and Super Mario Bros Movie (31 days). Barbie is only one of 20 titles to ever cross half billion at the domestic box office. She’s set to lead the U.S./Canada box office with $30M this weekend.

Meanwhile, as expected, Amblin/Universal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter is deep-sixing with $6.5M. Critics loated it at 45% Rotten. Audiences haven’t even expressed if they liked it or not on Rotten Tomatoes, which is an ugly sign. RelishMix reports that social media metrics for the period horror pic are tracking under under horror genre norms by 15% at 118.5M across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok combined. It also doesn’t help that the cast can’t promote on an original film on social media. This is a problem that Meg 2 and Teenage Mutant Turtles didn’t face as they were known pieces of IP; they can be sold strictly off their trailers.

RelishMix’s report on Demeter‘s online chatter before opening: “It runs mixed-leaning-positive, as horror fans are applauding Dracula’s ‘badass’ makeover and thrilled that vampires are getting their fangs back, shedding their softer, more cuddly recent depictions. The R-rating is also adding to the anticipation, promising a darker, more intense experience. Aisling Franciosi, has won some hearts from her previous work (GOThrones) — where are a few grumbles about the vampire’s big reveal in the trailer and the film’s dark cinematography, but this isn’t dampening the general enthusiasm — with some jabs about the CGI, while most threads steer positive.”

Here’s the chart:

1 Barbie (WB) 4,178 theaters – Fri $10M (-38%), 3-day $30M (-43%), Total $522.6M/Wk 4

2) Oppenheimer (Uni) 3,761 theaters, Fri $5M (-40%), 3-day $16.8M (-42%), Total $262.2M/Wk 4

3) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Par) 3,950 theaters, Fri $3.9M (-57%), 3-day $14.1M (-50%), Total $71.1M/Wk 2

4) The Meg 2 (WB) 3,604 theaters, Fri $3.5M (-71%), 3-day $12M (-60%), Total $53.5M/Wk 2

5) Last Voyage of the Demeter (Amb/Uni) 2,715 theaters, Fri $2.65M 3-day $6.5M/Wk 1

FRIDAY AM UPDATE: The only new wide release this weekend is Amblin’s period Dracula horror pic The Last Voyage of the Demeter being distributed by Universal. It made $750K last night in previews from showtimes that began at 5PM in 2,350 theaters in what is expected to be an underwhelming 3-day single digit million result for the $45M feature production. The R-rated pic expands to 2,715 theaters today.

That preview result is in the vicinity of last August’s vampire horror movie, The Invitation, which did $775K in previews, a $6.8M opening and $25.1M final domestic.

Why is this period horror film on the calendar? Because it’s from horror filmmaker André Øvredal. He excited the early August box office back in 2019 with Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. That movie from the shuttering CBS Studios label did an amazing $2.3M in previews for what turned out to be a $20.9M No. 2 opening in the face of the second weekend of Hobbs & Shaw. The sleeper PG-13 horror pic did close to $69M in U.S./Canada and $104.5M WW on what was a $25M production cost.

‘Barbie’ Warner Bros. Pictures

You’ll remember, Sony’s Gran Turismo moved off this date and opted for two weeks of sneaks before an Aug. 25 launch in an effort to build word of mouth for the feature take of the Sony Playstation game. No bother, as Warner Bros’ Barbie is expected to reign supreme in weekend 4 with $31.8M as she heads for half-billion stateside today. The Greta Gerwig-directed feature take of the Mattel toy has already cracked the $1 billion worldwide box office mark with just under $32M from China. Barbie did $7.1M yesterday at 4,178 theaters, -3% from Wednesday, for a running total through three weeks of $492.6M.

Universal’s Oppenheimer is also expected to ease -40% in its fourth weekend with around $17.5M at 3,612 theaters. The Christopher Nolan directed three-hour drama in Imax and 70M made an estimated $3.6M yesterday, -3% from Wednesday for a three-week total of $245.4M.

With more theatrical release date changes expected for the rest of 2023, one distribution head wisely remarked this week, “Watch Barbie and Oppenheimer play through Thanksgiving.”

Some box office trivia: Oppenheimer became the highest grossing film at Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre in the venue’s 97-year history hiting $1.53M on Wednesday. That beats the previous record at the venue set by 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens which earned $1.51M after 15 weeks of release. Oppenheimer has been extended at the TCL Chinese Theatre in IMAX 70mm film through the end of August.

“It’s been a historic run for us at the TCL Chinese with weeks of sold-out shows. We’ve added 6am shows for the last four weekends to satisfy audience demand,” says Brett Fellman, executive with the TCL Chinese Theatres.

Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem should also be down around 40% for a near $17M second weekend. Through its first nine days, the Nickelodeon/Point Grey animated pic did $57M at 3,858 theaters. Turtles did $2.7M yesterday, even with Wednesday.

Warner Bros’ The Meg 2: The Trench is eyeing a 60% decline in weekend two for $12M. Week one for the surprise No. 2 pic last weekend is $41.4M. Thursday was $2.1M, -3% from Wednesday, in fourth place for the day at 3,503.

Disney’s Haunted Mansion, booked at 3,740 theaters, made an estimated $1M, +2% from Wednesday for a two-week running total of $47.2M.

The Tamil language action comedy Jailer from Nelson Dilipkumar opened in 375 theaters on Wednesday doing an estimated $961K, followed by $627K yesterday for a two-day of $1.58M.

,TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES Co-Creator Kevin Eastman Has a Cameo in MUTANT MAYHEM — GeekTyrant,,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman got the Stan Lee cameo treatment in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. His cameo was confirmed by director Jeff Rowe during an interview with /Film.

I’ve seen the movie twice already, but I didn’t catch the cameo until it was pointed out. During an interview, Rowe was asked where Eastman appears given that his name features in the movie’s credits. He revealed the cameo and explains that Eastman wanted it to be meaningful:

“He’s the human who helps Splinter up at the end. He helps him out. And we wanted that to be someone meaningful to the franchise, and we were so happy Kevin was willing to do that. I’m appreciative of the Stan Lee cameos in Marvel films, and it felt like a great way to honor him and the beautiful gift he has given the world.”

Heck yeah! It’s awesome that Eastman got a cameo in the film! He and Peter Laird are the guys that brought these awesome Heroes in a Half-Shell into the world and our lives are better because of it. It’s hard to imagine a world without Ninja Turtles! It’s great that they were able to pay tribute to that in Mutant Mayhem.

2023-08-03 16:00:00+00:00,Review: Passages,,"What’s remarkable about Passages isn’t the just frankness of this sometimes-brutal, NC-17-rated relationship drama. It’s that it arrives from Ira Sachs, the man behind such gentle films as Love is Strange and Little Men. Passages features all the intimate humanity of Sachs’s last decade of work, but he adds a wonderfully bitter edge and a sharp humor in its depiction of a love triangle between a temperamental director, his steady graphic designer husband, and a young female school teacher.

“I had sex with a woman. Can I tell you about it please?” says Tomas (Franz Rogowski) to his husband, Martin (Ben Whishaw), after he returns home invigorated after a night with Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). The audience giggles at the audacity of the request, but Martin is less enthused by his partner’s plea. Martin quickly turns sanguine, and it’s clear that this is not the first time Tomas has been enamored of someone else—and felt the need to tell his husband about it. Tomas moves out (and in with Agathe), while Martin quickly falls for another man, causing the fickle Tomas to lose interest in Agathe and find himself returning to Martin.

It’s all very modern and incredibly European. Sachs may be American, but he spent time in Paris, where Passages takes place, and the central trio of the cast each have a different nationality: Rogoski is German, Whishaw is British, and Exarchopoulos is French. That’s not to say this type of thing doesn’t happen in America (or American movies), but even in 2023, this brand of love triangle and the casualness around it on screen feels like it could only come from Europe—or Brooklyn. Rogowski’s Tomas feels like someone who read the Blinkist summary of The Ethical Slut, but he didn’t learn anything from skimming the synopsis. He’s strikingly open about his sex and love life, but he doesn’t consider anyone else’s feelings in his approach to non-monogamy. He pings between Agathe and Martin, losing interest almost immediately after his attraction is reciprocated.

Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias have crafted a sharply drawn character study, centering on Rogowski’s supremely self-involved Tomas, whom film Tiktok is sure to call a narcissist if its users discover this Mubi movie. Rogowski is incredibly charming, swinging his narrow hips and seducing the audience even though we know better. He has the type of magnetism that makes it easy to see how he keeps drawing people back to him, despite being the type of fuckboi who shows up incredibly late to meet your parents for the first time wearing a crop top.



Everything I write about Passages makes me sound like such a square, but this NC-17 movie doesn’t want to shock the audience — and that isn’t the primary reaction it evokes. Sachs isn’t Larry Clark. Instead, the drama of these relationships and all the sex these three people have in various permutations (and positions) is more there for honesty’s sake, with long takes in both the intense love scenes and equally fervent dialogue-driven ones making the audience feel present with Tomas, Martin, and Agathe. The sex in Passages is undeniably hot; Sachs’s naturalistic approach to the trio’s feverish lust is heady and thrilling, with glimpses of the act that aren’t generally seen on screen.

Even beyond the sex, Sachs and Zacharias are genuinely inquisitive about the complexities of desire, relationships, and emotions. They aren’t judging these characters—even Tomas and even when he’s being a total asshole, which is most of the movie. (I am judging Tomas.) While Passages doesn’t belie the seriousness of anyone’s actions or their effects on those around them, the drama is inflected with moments of awkward comedy, especially around Tomas’s behavior.

Those moments in Passages are at once ridiculous and entirely believable, which is why Sachs’s film works so well. These characters feel real and identifiable in their actions and flaws, consistently compelling whether they’re revealing their skin or their emotions.

2023-07-30 21:28:16+00:00,'Dreamin’ Wild' Review: A Melancholy Ode to Second Chances,The elegantly underplayed performances ensure that Bill Pohlad’s 'Dreamin’ Wild' never succumbs to melodrama.,"Writer-director Bill Pohlad’s Dreamin’ Wild movingly dramatizes the real-life story of Donnie (Casey Affleck) and Joe Emerson (Walton Goggins), two unassuming, blue-collar brothers from Fruitland, Washington, and their winding road to success. In 1979, the teenaged Emersons recorded the titular album in a studio built by their supportive father, Don Sr. (Beau Bridges). It was quickly forgotten, but in the early 2010s, after the rediscovery of the LP in an antique store, the brothers become underground cult heroes.

Pohlad is uninterested in turning the film into a checklist of the escalating milestones and setbacks in the Emerson brothers’ history, as evidenced by the fact that we mostly get a sense of these events via offhand comments and off-screen background chatter. And yet, we still get a profound sense of how those events shape the experiences of the Emerson brothers.

That much is clear from a number of wonderfully crafted moments, most notably an early scene in which Matt Sullivan (Chris Messina), owner of a boutique record label, visits the Emerson family and expresses his desire to reissue the brothers’ album. As Sullivan and the Emersons are heard off screen discussing the cult following that the album has attracted, the camera focuses at length on a silent Donnie growing visibly uncomfortable as he takes in the news.

While it’s initially unclear why Donnie feels that way, Pohlad’s screenplay steadily reveals the various causes via its conspicuously non-chronological structure. Throughout this elegiac but easygoing work, events from the present are intercut with those from the past, when Donnie (Noah Jupe) and Joe (Jack Dylan Grazer) first recorded their album.

This approach isn’t new for Pohlad, as his Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy also utilized intertwining storylines from separate eras in the career of the Beach Boy. But where that film’s crosscutting between past and present and use of different actors to portray Wilson appeared like a self-consciously gimmicky attempt to elevate an otherwise generic, straightforward recap of Wilson’s life, the filmmaker has a better feel for narrative structuring in Dreamin’ Wild.

Pohlad isn’t trying to feed audiences the simple logic of cause and effect, as he and his actors truly grapple with the interplay between the past and present throughout the film. The way that Donnie was occasionally demanding and controlling around Joe during their younger years informs and offers context on the mindset of the former as an adult. In this sense, Pohlad ruminatively articulates that the rediscovery of the Emersons’ LP also means that Donnie’s unresolved feelings, like regret over his past actions, resurface along with it.

The elegantly underplayed performances also ensure that Dreamin’ Wild never succumbs to melodrama, especially in a couple of late scenes where the characters give voice to long-repressed feelings. While the film’s dialogue makes clear how characters are moving toward epiphanies and admissions of guilt, the performances by Affleck, Bridges, and Goggins make that journey feel affecting and deeply restrained, adding an extra layer of poignancy to the film.

2023-08-18 03:07:41+00:00,Bad Things Review : Diet ‘Shining’,,"I’m generally wary of movies that get compared to great films. Enter “Bad Things,” which bills itself as a female-version of “The Shining.” The early reviews reference how similar in vein it is to Kubrick’s 1980 film. So, I guess I’ll be the proverbial turd in the punch bowl by saying that, yes, it is similar to “The Shining” in a lot of ways, mainly visuals and hotel specters, but that’s about it since it’s far from being a horror classic, much less a horror film I can even recommend.

Ruthie (Gayle Rankin) has inherited her grandmother’s closed and aging hotel, somewhere in New England (most likely). Ruthie is just looking to sell the mid-century modern hotel because of bad childhood memories involving her mother, but Ruthie’s girlfriend Cal (Hari Nef) doesn’t quite see it like that. Cal sees an exciting business opportunity and organizes a girl’s week, inviting two pals, Maddie (Rad Pereira) and Fran (Annabelle Dexter-Jones). So, for the next 80ish minutes, we’ll be treated to gossip about a potential love rectangle between the four ladies, rumors of the hotel being haunted, and visuals that may or may not be real.

The film’s brief runtime and the hope that there’s a decent payoff kept me engaged throughout most of “Bad Things,” even if I found myself wondering what the purpose of any of it was. Cal seems so focused on reopening the hotel, but never really articulates why, which becomes annoying as Ruthie’s mental health declines as she’s constantly reminded about her mother’s parental shortcomings. If Cal was an actual caring partner to Ruthie, you’d think she’d drop the whole idea, much less convince her to have a gal pal weekend in it. As for Maddie and Fran, it seems like there’s skeletons in their closet when it comes to their prior relationships to Ruthie and Cal. It’s almost as if Cal has intentionally planned a weekend to sabotage her own relationship or is that willfully ignorant of other people’s emotions.

References to “The Shining” are sprinkled throughout, but never really feel like an homage or slice of true terror, coming off more like a cringy wink at the camera. The worst moment is when one of the characters sees ghosts eating breakfast in the hotel’s dining area, much like Wendy Torrance encountering a ghoulish party in the final act of “The Shining.” It doesn’t help that, unlike “The Shining,” the girls can leave at any time and are literally a block away from a strip mall. The isolationism that’s perfectly encompassed in Kubrick’s film is nowhere in sight of “Bad Things.”

Despite my frustrations, I was never bored, which is fascinating in of itself. Despite never being scared, the cinematography really makes the hotel a fascinating character. While you’re most likely to have your suspicions that the ghosts aren’t real, the hotel is filmed in such a way that you never feel like the characters are safe from something paranormal. Even in the bitter, snowy cold, the hotel doesn’t seem welcoming or the last place you’d want to be stuck in. Keeping things moving is the cast, which is constantly gnawing on the stale, peeling scenery of the hotel. Rankin steals the show by the end of the film, but Nef, Pereira and Dexter-Jones each have individual scenes they can add to their highlight reel because of how convincing they are in those moments.

I have to wonder how much better “Bad Things” would have been if the film’s promotional material wasn’t attempting to tell me how Kubrickian it was. There’s a lot going for it, including the cinematography, the acting and several ideas that are placed throughout. Even the ideas that I came to enjoy ultimately failed because they were never fully realized. I can’t help, but wonder how much better the film would have been if it leaned more into psychological horror or even implemented more slasher tropes. There’s definitely a way better film in this tangled mess, but “Bad Things” can’t overcome being a bad thing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWVob2xlLm5ldC9iYWQtdGhpbmdzLXJldmlldy1kaWV0LXNoaW5pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"""We were trying to figure out a joke"" - Jeff Rowe on bringing Post Malone","One of the filmmakers’ favorite comedic developments came when working with Post Malone, who is much better known as a musician.","Get set to witness the magic and nostalgia of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the big screen this August. Paramount Pictures and Viacom18 Studios are all set to release Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutant Mayhem pan India in English and Hindi on Aug 25.



Leading the pack of this motley group of Turtle maniacs are none other than producer and creator Seth Rogen and director Jeff Rowe. The film boasts of a star-studded cast, including Jackie Chan as the voice of Splinter, the vocal talents of John Cena, Post Malone, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Brady Noon, and Maya Rudolph.

Getting in so many great comedians made for plenty of improvisation and character development in the moment, but one of the filmmakers’ favorite comedic developments came when working with Post Malone, who is much better known as a musician.

“We were trying to figure out a joke for all the mutants,” says Rogen's producing partner James Weaver. “With [humanoid manta ray] Ray Fillet we said, ‘What is the joke?’ We wondered, ‘What if he just sings his name?’ Post was one of the last people to record. We had no idea what that was going to sound like. And then in the first screening you just have Post Malone singing ‘Ray Fillet’ and it just can’t help but make you smile.”

Director Jeff Rowe remembers that process with a broad smile. “We were desperate to have Ray Fillet in this movie because he’s one of our favorite characters,” says Rowe. “But we couldn’t figure out what he would do in the film. I had this idea that he’d be like Matt Damon in Team America, where he just had the one line he’d say over and over. At the same time, there were conversations going on that Post Malone might be interested in doing something in our film. So I said, ‘Would he be interested in being Ray Fillet, and just singing that name really beautifully – as his only line – in the film?’ Unbelievably, he said yes!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhZm9ydW1zLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3dlLXdlcmUtdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWZpZ3VyZS1vdXQtYS1qb2tlLWplZmYtcm93ZS1vbi1icmluZ2luZy1wb3N0LW1hbG9uZV8xOTk1NjfSAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYWZvcnVtcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93ZS13ZXJlLXRyeWluZy10by1maWd1cmUtb3V0LWEtam9rZS1qZWZmLXJvd2Utb24tYnJpbmdpbmctcG9zdC1tYWxvbmVfMTk5NTY3P21vZGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 14:12:29+00:00,'Theater Camp' Review: A Musical Farce for Theater Nerds,'Theater Camp' feels like sitting through extended acting exercises where everyone is giving it 110% every take.,"Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman’s Theater Camp suggests Christopher Guest’s Waiting for Guffman as made by, and starring, theater brats. The largely improvised film also lovingly lampoons the more ridiculous and high-strung tendencies of overly serious community theater types, but does so with an earnest gusto that quickly becomes tiresome.

Guest’s 1996 film is populated by a murderer’s row of skilled improvisers whose work, even at its most over the top, feels effortless, with a lived-in quality that grounds the absurdity in a heightened yet recognizable reality. By contrast, Theater Camp’s comedy mostly comes across as forced and laborious, which makes watching the film, at times, feel like sitting through extended acting exercises where everyone is giving it 110% every take.

Adapted from Lieberman’s 2020 short of the same name, Theater Camp grew out of co-writers Gordon, Lieberman, Ben Platt, and Noah Galvin’s desire to, per Gordon, “make something with our friends.” This approach no doubt extended to the feature-length version, but the sense that the performers are striving only to make each other laugh results in an insular feel.

Gordon and Lieberman’s film is set in a musical theater camp for kids in upstate New York called AdirondACTS—a pun that’s a perfect litmus test for anyone wanting to know if the humor here is up their alley. Theater Camp’s thin plot is set in motion when the camp’s founder, Joan Rubinsky (Amy Sedaris), slips into a coma from the strobe effects used during a performance of Bye Bye Birdie. Regrettably, this sidelines the film’s funniest performer after a mere five minutes, shifting the focus to the strained friendship of two longtime, codependent friends, Rebecca-Diane (Gordon) and Amos (Platt), who are now forced to run the camp’s operations.

This critic got some chuckles out of Rebecca-Diane and Amos navigating their changing roles, particularly when they’re forced to deal with Joan’s finance-bro son (Jimmy Tatro), who must fight off the advances of the owner of the swank neighboring camp (Patti Harrison) who’s looking to buy up the AdirondACTS property. But the film’s jokes quickly grow repetitive, as most of the actors lean into doubling down on their one-note characters’ most annoying traits.

An exception to this exhausting mode is Ayo Edebiri, who plays an acting teacher, Janet Walch, who egregiously lied on her resume to get the job. Edebiri, the breakout star of FX’s The Bear, steals scene after scene as Janet bumbles through her sessions and half-heartedly tries to mimic the excitement of everyone else at the camp, most memorably during a lesson on stage combat. If only more of Edebiri’s relaxed spontaneity had worn off on the rest of Theater Camp, which exceeds the boundaries of self-parody as it spins its wheels through so many of its scenes.

,TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM Director Wants To Introduce Krang in Sequel — GeekTyrant,,"I’m pretty stoked about watching the upcoming movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem! I’ve seen quite a bit of footage from the movie already, and it looks like a radical fun flick! It’s just such a unique way to tell the story of these beloved characters and I hope that the movie ends up being a success at the box office because it’s be cool if the franchise continued.

If the film does end up sparking a sequel, director Jeff Rowe wants to introduce the classic villainous alien character Krang! During a recent interview with CB, the filmmaker was asked what character he would like to play with in the next chapter of the story and he said:

""Krang. Krang is so interesting to me. The Arnie suit. I'm like, we gotta do something with Krang.""

He didn’t go into any details on how he would incorporate the character into the story, but it would be awesome to see the character incorporated into this reimagining of the franchise. I can only imagine how wild the character design and style would be!

Krang is a notorious character from the franchise and is an alien warlord from Dimension X and is unique due to his form, which is that of a giant brain. Once a feared conqueror in his home dimension, Krang was stripped of his body and banished to Earth, where he allied himself with Shredder and constructed a powerful humanoid exo-suit to house his brain form. Known for his high intellect and less-than-pleasant personality, Krang is consistently working on plans to conquer Earth, often leading to battles with the Ninja Turtles.

Rowe also previously teased Shredder’s future involvement saying: ""We'll Dark Knight it.” He went on to say that he'd 100% love to develop a sequel and shared: ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""

In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.

When previously talking about the tone of the film, director Jeff Rowe revealed the vibe they were going for:. “We wanted it to be like Stand By Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles.”

The voice cast of the film includes Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Jackie Chan as Splinter, John Cena as Rocksteady, Seth Rogen as Bebop, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut, Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Post Malone as Ray Fillet, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, and Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom.

(A) BARBIE Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) are having the time of their lives in the colorful and seemingly perfect world of Barbie Land. However, when they get a chance to go to the real world, they soon discover the joys and perils of living among humans. Director Greta Gerwig cleaves through culture with gleeful spirit and savage humor in this existential exegesis on what it means to be a woman, and a human, reflecting our world back to us through the lens of Barbie. In doing so, she delivers a barbed statement wrapped in a visually sumptuous and sublimely silly cinematic confection. PG-13 (for suggestive references and brief language). 114 mins.

(A-) ELEMENTAL It’s fairly rare that animation studio Pixar makes a straightforward romantic movie, but that’s what we get in the visually dazzling Elemental, which features the forbidden love between two elements that don’t mix: fire and water. While the film is a truly eye-popping expression of animation technology, it’s the romance between Ember (Leah Lewis) and Wade (Mamoudou Athie) that makes Elemental worth your time, thanks to a romantic male lead who is sweet and adorable, a refreshing update to the proud, barrel-chested Disney princes of yore.

(D+) HAUNTED MANSION With muddy CGI, far too much story and an emotional heart in cardiac arrest, this movie — based on the Disney theme park ride of the same name — simply doesn’t hold together. The film centers on Ben (LaKeith Stanfield), an astrophysicist turned New Orleans tour guide who is particularly skeptical of ghosts. He’s approached by Father Kent (Dallas native Owen Wilson) to help single mom Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) and her son Travis (Chase Dillon) with a problem in their new home: It’s infested with poltergeists. They recruit a medium (Tiffany Haddish) and a ghost historian (Danny DeVito, who provides some much-needed energy to the film). What should have been a light summer romp is rarely funny, never scary and a boring mess. PG-13 (for some thematic elements and scary action). 122 mins.

(B-) INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY Harrison Ford is back one more time — and one last time, he has said — in the franchise’s fifth installment. To start things off, de-aging technology gives us a 45-year-old Indiana Jones doing some of the wildest stunts we’ve ever seen our beloved archaeology professor attempt, allowing us to go on one last adventure with the Indy we grew up with. Then we’re thrust back to reality with a nearly 80-year-old Ford playing a 70-something Indy, but he’s soon back up to his adventuresome self and trying to decide whether he can trust co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character, a brilliant archaeologist who sells stolen antiquities to the world’s wealthiest. Despite a cumbersome plot, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is solid, swashbuckling summer fare and a dignified send-off to one of cinema’s most flawless castings. PG-13 (for sequences of violence and action, language and smoking). 144 mins.

INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut with this fifth installment of the hugely profitable horror series, last visited in 2018′s Insidious: The Last Key. PG-13 (for violence, terror, frightening images, strong language and suggestive references). 107 mins.

(C) THE LITTLE MERMAID Halle Bailey stars as Ariel in the beloved tale about a mermaid who longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and falls in love with a human prince (Jonah Hauer-King). Although Bailey is a lovely presence and possesses a superb voice, this remake doesn’t really sing. Like several other Disney live-action retreads, it prioritizes nostalgia and familiarity over compelling visual storytelling. Also starring Melissa McCarthy as the evil sea witch Ursula and Javier Bardem as King Triton, with songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. PG (for action/peril and some scary images). 135 mins.

The two forge a bond after a disastrous date, and something like a friendship blossoms. What they both really need, and what they find, is someone to just listen and to share vulnerability in return.

Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist behind the atomic bomb. Director Christopher Nolan dominates viewers with a visual and sonic riptide, bringing a jagged, dissonant sensibility to a film that focuses less on facts and more on feeling as it thrusts the audience into the advent and fallout of the nuclear arms race.

(A-) SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE Following the continuing multiverse adventures of Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), this sequel to 2018′s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse contains every element that made the first one, which won an Oscar for best animated feature film, so compelling: the characters, the eye-popping production design, the perfectly calibrated music. It goes a step further and evolves the aesthetic and story into a darker, edgier place as the writers hammer home the pertinent themes — growing up and finding yourself is hard, and so is parenting, especially letting go when your kids need to find their own way.

(A-) THEATER CAMP When a clueless tech bro (Jimmy Tatro) takes over a rundown summer camp in upstate New York, the staffers and students band together to try to stage a masterpiece and keep the camp afloat. This pitch-perfect mockumentary is a comedic gem, with the chops to become a beloved camp classic. Also starring Ben Platt, Molly Gordon and Noah Galvin. PG-13 (for some strong language and suggestive/drug references). 94 mins.

(D+) TRANSFORMERS: RISE OF THE BEASTS The Transformers film franchise, spawned in 2007, was one of the first straight-faced blockbuster franchises based on a toy (and a 1980s cartoon series). It is now, astonishingly, seven films deep with the release of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, which is both a prequel to the first Transformers and a sequel to 2018′s Bumblebee. Set in 1994, Rise of the Beasts is based on the Transformers: Beast Wars media franchise of comic books and anime, which introduced the Maximal characters, alien robots that look like giant animals, not shape-shifting cars. Got all that? It’s OK if you don’t, because the screenplay will repeat the pertinent information ad nauseam. This dull and disposable film is a beast that needs to be put down. PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, and language). 127 mins.

2023-08-05 12:37:00+00:00,Does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Have a Post-Credits Scene?,The animated reboot 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' teases the return of an old villain in a mid-credits sequence. Here's what to know.,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been knocking around pop culture, kicking ass and eating pizza, for four decades—and the new animated movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, reboots the franchise for a new generation.
This time around, the heroes in a half shell Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey and Shamon Brown Jr., while their friend and ally, budding reporter April O'Neill, is played by The Bear's Ayo Edebiri. Martial arts movie star Jackie Chan plays their adoptive father Splinter, and the movie's main antagonist Superfly is voiced by Ice Cube, backed up by a supporting cast of impressive cameo voices which include Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Maya Rudolph, and Seth Rogen, who also co-wrote the script.
While Mutant Mayhem is a self-contained movie and offers up a fresh version of the turtles' origin story, this project was also clearly designed to set up future installments in the franchise. And if there's one thing that we've all learned from over a decade of Marvel movies, it's that there's no way to tease a sequel like including a stinger after the credits.
Paramount
Does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have a post-credits sequence?
The movie does feature an epilogue, but don't worry, you won't have to stay seated and wait for the entire credits to roll before seeing it.
Spoilers ahead:
In a mid-credits sequence which plays almost as soon as the film is over, we catch up with Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo in a video diary as all four brothers adjust to their new life at high school, even attending prom, while April continues her investigation into TCRI.
But then the audience viewpoint pans away from the turtles, and we see that they are being spied on by TCRI executive Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who still harbors a grudge against all mutants created by the ""ooze"" which transformed the turtles. But she is not alone: the final shot of the mid-credits scene reveals the silhouette of the Shredder, arguably the most iconic villain in TMNT history, who will undoubtedly be causing trouble when the sequel comes around.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is only in theatres August 2nd, and our entire family is so excited to see this film that we had a whole day of fun making green ""mutant"" slime, creating a fun TMNT-themed sensory box, and outfitting my kids in DIY Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle outfits.
I grew up watching the original TMNT cartoon, and I wanted to be April, because I wanted to be a reporter. Although I never thought I would be as cool as she was when she met the turtles for the first time.
The author received compensation for this article. All thoughts and opinions expressed are her own.
Now it's time for the next generation to get Turtlemania! My kids got really excited watching the trailer, and they are already counting down the days to August 2nd when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem comes to theatres.
See the trailer:
This newest version looks so great: In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the turtles meet other mutants — Superfly and his goons — each with their own wacky personalities and voices, many of which will sound familiar to us parents! There is serious mayhem, action, and laughter packed in this movie, produced by Seth Rogan. He describes it as ""a comedic action movie with heart"" — now that is something I can get into!
My kids are already Turtle fans — my 4-year-old even has the bedspread and pillowcases, and we have TMNT toys they all love.
The best part is that my kids' action figures are very similar to the ones my husband and his brother played with when they were kids!
I love that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will really bring our family — which includes me and my husband, a teenager, an elementary school kid, a preschooler, and a toddler — together in a way that is special and unique.
In all my ""Summer Momming"" glory, I decided to take this Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie release as an opportunity to have a little fun and create some awesome family memories with three activities — making green ""mutant"" slime, creating a fun TMNT-themed sensory box, and outfitting them in DIY Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle outfits.
Want to have your own at-home fun with TMNT before the movie comes out in theatres August 2?
Here is how we created our fun and how you can too:
Mutant slime
I remember making slime with my teenager years ago, so I asked him if he would teach the little ones how to make ""Mutant Slime."" He loved the idea, and we set out to get the ingredients!
Mutant Mayhem Slime
What you need:
1/4 tsp Borax powder (found in laundry detergent aisle)
1/2 cup clear or white washable school glue
1 cup of warm water divided into 1/2 cups
Optional: Green food coloring, glitter, confetti
Directions:
1. Combine the Borax and the (warm) water until it is mostly dissolved.
2. Slowly add it to a bowl of glue.
3. Stir in your food colorings and other optional add-ins to create your mutant slime!
4. Knead until it's the right consistency.
What I liked about this slime is it really stayed together and didn't get a ton of sticky bits on your fingers (or the floor, or the walls...) as they played with it.
My kids played with the slime for hours. It was a definite win! And I was really happy to watch the boys create something together. It made this mama's heart happy. I also think my teen enjoyed being in charge of the project. He got the recipe, helped me find the ingredients, instructed the littles, and even cleaned up after himself when he was done!
My kids are like the ninja turtles — brothers who joke, play fight, even fight, but ultimately always stand up for each other and have that unbreakable bond. I want my boys to see and feel that when they watch this movie. And my husband and I now can relate in new ways to Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan) and find the humor in raising these boys!
TMNT FUN FACT:
Did YOU Know? Contact with the ooze, also called the ""mutagen,"" r esults in macro-level changes to an individual's genetic structure . Humans who come into contact with the ooze tend to mutate into anthropomorphized animals.
Mutant sensory box
This was so easy, and provided a ton of entertainment: We bought Kinetic sand and some TMNT legos to make sensory boxes for my preschool and toddler to play with (waterbeads would be a good substitute!). Again this was a nice long, entertaining activity for them, and there was very little cleanup thanks to the containers! Mom win!
Cosplay Turtle fun
Now comes the crafty fun. I would like to preface this by first letting you know I have an incredible lack of artistic talent. But I've got Pinterest, a dream, and 4 kids to entertain for the summer, so here goes!
My arts and craft plan was to create:
1) Turtle masks
2) Turtle shells
3) Pool noodle nunchucks
So I gathered the supplies and went to work! We traced, cut, glued, poked, painted, and tied knots. I wish I would've taken more pictures, but the responsible mom was on duty...
Here is how we made our awesome cosplay outfits:
Pool Noodle Nunchucks
What you need:
Pool noodle
Sharp knife (adults only) I used a bread knife
Screwdriver (adults only)
Yarn or e lastic
Scissors
Duct tape
Directions:
1. Use a knife to cut the pool noodle into two 8-inch pieces.
2. Use a screwdriver to puncture a small hold on one side of each pool noodle, an inch from the bottom. String a piece of yarn or elastic through the holes to attach the pool noodles together.
3. Wrap a piece of duct tape around the base of each pool noodle.
Ninja Turtle Shells
What you need:
Large Aluminum Roasting Pan
Green Spray Paint
Elastic band/cording
Scissors or hole puncher
Directions:
1. Spray paint the bottom of the roasting pan green. Let dry
2. Poke holes through the top and bottom corners of the pan
3. Measure the elastic band the length of one side (Top hole to bottom hole) Cut 2 of these.
4. Tie a knot on both ends, connecting the elastic-like backpack straps.
Ninja Turtle Masks
What you need:
Felt
Mask template printable
Marker
Scissors
Hot glue
Velcro
Directions:
1. Trace the template pieces onto the felt pieces
2. Cut the templates out.
3. Arrange the pieces in order and glue them together.
4. Attach the velcro pieces to the proper size for your child.
My kids had a blast making their costumes, and then playing with them. This will definitely keep the hype and excitement going at our house until August 2 when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is released in theatres!

Ahead of its release in theaters next week, it looks like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is already greenlit for not just a film sequel, but a Paramount+ series as well.
As reported by Variety , Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon movies are developing both a sequel film and a two-season, 2D animated series that will serve as a ""bridge"" between the two movies. The series will be entitled ""Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" and will run on, no surprise, Paramount+ at an as-yet-unannounced date. All four turtles - Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon - will return to voice the same roles they held in the film.
We spoke to Rowe recently at San Diego Comic-Con where he lightly teased his involvement in a sequel film, as well as discussed casting the turtles and characters like Splinter and April, and his animation inspirations from films series like Spider-Verse.

Why? He liked turtles.
Attending the Rose Festival in Portland, Oregon in 2007, Know Your Meme explains, Ware had painted his tiny face to look like a zombie for the occasion. When local news reporter Nancy Francis interviewed him about it for KGW, he had one thing to say about his paint job: ""I like turtles."" It was a passing vox pop, but one uploaded to YouTube by 3mediapro, where it went viral. Today, it's sitting at 72 million views.
Does Ware still like turtles? If you'd lost sleep over this, you'll get that sweet REM tonight, because reader, he does.
The marketing team for Seth Rogen's upcoming film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem tracked him down and recreated the whole thing.

2023-08-08 16:06:00+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Is Getting a Sequel and TV Show,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' is getting both a sequel and spinoff TV series. Here's everything we know about both projects so far.,"Every generation has its own slang, its own fashions, and its own take on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The recently released animated action comedy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem offers up a brand new origin story for Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown, Jr.) as they leave the shelter of the sewer home where they have been raised by Splinter (Jackie Chan). Once in the world above, they team up with teen reporter April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri) to defeat the mutant villain Superfly (Ice Cube), kick ass, and eat a whole lot of pizza.
Unlike the majority of previous iterations, Mutant Mayhem puts the emphasis on the ""teenage"" component of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, centering the awkwardness and vulnerability of the four brothers in the movie's narrative. And this creative decision, along with a star-studded voice cast and banger-filled soundtrack, is one of the reasons it's turning out to be one of the best-reviewed Turtles films in years.
""Through its perfectly imperfect animation style and a reimagining of the franchise’s world and characters, Mutant Mayhem is an exciting entry in a long-running series that makes it feel fresher than ever,"" wrote Daniel Chin at The Ringer, while Johnny Oleksinski at the New York Post called Mutant Mayhem the TMNT's ""finest hour (and a half).""
So, with all of this praise, and a mid-credit scene which teases the return of a famous villain, a sequel is all-but guaranteed, right?
Paramount
Will Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem get a sequel?
Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo will return: a sequel to Mutant Mayhem has officially been green-lit by Paramount Studios and will be directed once again by Jeff Rowe.
Not only that, but these new versions of the iconic characters will also appear in an animated TV series, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which has been commissioned for two seasons to ""bridge the gap"" between movies and will air on Paramount+.
Who will be in the cast?
Voice actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon are all expected to reprise their roles as the four brothers in the sequel as well as the spinoff show. It's unclear yet whether Jackie Chan will once again play Splinter, or if Ayo Edebiri (currently gaining acclaim for her role in The Bear) will return as April O'Neil.
When will TMNT 2 be released?
The sequel was in development when the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes began, so as of right now, there is no release date confirmed.

After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O'Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri) helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is directed by animation filmmaker Jeff Rowe (co-director on The Mitchells vs the Machines previously, staff writer on ""Disenchantment"") and co-directed by Kyle Spears (director on ""Amphibia"" series, a writer on ""We Bare Bears"", storyboard artist). The screenplay is written by Brendan O'Brien. It's produced by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver. Animated by Nickelodeon Animation Studios. Based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Characters Created by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. Paramount will debut Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem in theaters nationwide starting August 2nd, 2023 this summer.

,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been a pretty consistent part of the pop culture landscape since Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s scrappy self-published comic became a sensation in the mid-1980s, spawning an iconic animated series and a popular toy line. In the years since, that initial spark of creativity has inspired several distinct animated universes, two live-action film series, a bevy of toys, multiple video games, mountains of comics, and at least one rock music tour.
With all of that in mind, we’re getting a brand new version of the plucky amphibian heroes in the form of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which looks to stoke the fires of 1980s nostalgia and introduce the Turtles to a new generation. If the previews released so far are anything to go by, the film appears to strike the right chords for older TMNT fans while also appealing to their children and – in some cases – grandchildren. Let’s head to the sewers and dredge up everything we know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
The Mutagen Strikes Again

Starting afresh – as opposed to continuing one of the existing film or TV continuities – the film sees the Turtles, after years of seclusion and training, making their way to the surface in the hopes of being embraced by humanity. Befriending April O’Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), the team takes on a reclusive crime syndicate to keep the streets and sewers safe. And, maybe, they’ll find the acceptance they crave along the way.
Some fans may notice the absence of certain details – notably the Foot Clan and the ever-present Turtles nemesis Shredder – but the presence of characters like Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena) suggests those TMNT staples will appear in due course. See also: Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who often appears in Turtles stories as a press-ganged scientist aiding the Foot in the creation of their own mutants. Although, just as often, he willingly helps as it furthers his own aims and research in mutation.
And, as it happens, other mutants will quickly become a cause of concern for the Turtles. Will they be friends or foes? Considering the film is subtitled Mutant Mayhem, expect that question to drive some of the action.
The Sewers and the Streets

Naturally enough, the Turtles inhabit New York. But judging from our first glimpses at the film, it is a stylized New York one might expect Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Miles Morales to visit. Indeed, the art direction was one of the big appeals for long-time fans when a teaser first arrived in March. Distinct from previous iterations of the Turtles, it also feels like a natural path for the comic book-inspired film.
Beyond that, the swift introduction of alien worlds (and aliens) in the original Eastman and Laird comics and the first animated series means there is always room for the Turtles to visit locations less grounded than Manhattan.

Eschewing the typical pattern for the Turtles voice cast – or even long-time voice actors like Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, or Greg Cipes – the film will feature four actual teenagers in the lead roles. The Walking Dead: World Beyond‘s Nicolas Cantu leads as Leonardo, the most dedicated of Master Splinter’s pupils to their training and goals. Micah Abbey lends his voice to generally tech-smart Donatello. Brady Noon of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers brings the attitude as a new Raphael, while Shamon Brown Jr. parties it up as Michelangelo.
Of course, we’re assuming the personalities of the Turtles will remain intact in Mutant Mayhem, but as seen in the teaser trailer, casting a group of young men leads to a noticeably different interpretation of the characters – vocally, at least. Additionally, the group recorded their dialogue together, offering a chance for more improvisation and a greater sense of camaraderie, which we clearly see in the scene of the Turtles goofing off in the teaser.
Beyond the four leads, the film is outfitted with a surprising number of familiar names – many of them playing surprising character pulls from Turtles history. Starting with the most recognizable characters, The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri lends her voice to this version of April O’Neil. The character has had many permutations over the years, from TV anchor to budding reporter to straight-up ninja, so anything is possible with Edebiri and her take on the Turtles’ most constant friend. Jackie Chan takes on the role of Master Splinter, the boys’ sensei and adoptive father.

As mentioned above, the recognizable bad guys include Bebop and Rocksteady, voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena, respectively, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman. Will the latter end up a fly by the end of the film? Time will tell.
Paul Rudd offers his talents as Mondo Gecko, the radical skateboarding lizard who has been part of TMNT lore since 1989. Rose Byrne plays Leatherhead, a mutant alligator who has been both friend and foe to the Turtles over the years. Post Malone voices Ray Fillet, a character who first appeared in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series as “Man-Ray” but soon made his way to the action figure aisles under his subsequent moniker. Hannibal Buress becomes Genghis Frog, one of the original toy line’s attempts at beating imitators to the punch with a group known as the Punk Frogs. Natasia Demetriou takes on Wingnut, a humanoid bat who is sometimes an alien, a mutant, a would-be superhero, or a terrorist, depending on the era and series. Maya Rudolph is Cynthia Utrom – a character who might seem new for the film, but with a last name that fans will certainly recognize and that suggests something very specific about who she might truly be.

And finally, Ice Cube is Superfly, a new addition to the group of mutants to be featured in the film, who is revealed to be the primary villain in the latest trailer. Taking a page out of X-Men nemesis Magneto’s playbook, Superfly asserts that humans will never accept mutants like him and his cohorts, so he’s out to conquer mankind and put mutants in charge. Bebop, Rocksteady, and the others accordingly appear to be on his side.
While all the other mutants certainly pull at the nostalgia strings, the new direction in casting the Turtles voices may be the key thing that opens the characters up to a new generation of fans.

The film is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs The Machines – which he also wrote – and a staff writer on Gravity Falls and Disenchantment. Joining him as co-director is Kyler Spears, who also worked on Mitchells as a storyboard artist; considering their past collaboration, it’s no surprise that Mutant Mayhem feels like the next step in the evolution of the visual style we saw in Mitchells. Rowe also wrote Mutant Mayhem in conjunction with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit.
According to Rogen, part of the intent is to lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the title more heavily than in past iterations, citing movies like Stand By Me as inspiration. Based on the teaser, it definitely appears his intent made it to the finished product.
Rogen and Goldberg serve as producers with Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean as executive producers. Other crew include procution designer Yashar Kassai, character designer James A. Castillo, production supervisor Derek Manzella, and post-production supervisor Ryan Price.

2023-08-16 02:02:00+00:00,‘TMNT: Mutant Mayhem’ retelling movie review,"With intricate designs and a fun vibe to match the compelling story, ‘Mutant Mayhem’ is a mark of pride in the TMNT universe.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series is not for the faint of heart: notoriously long-winded and complicated, reboots that produce complex (but often refreshing) reimaginations of the characters and numerous antagonists that easily go from mutant of the week to villain of the year. Time after time after time, live-action adaptations of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have almost given me nightmares from how ugly they were.
Nightmares aside, I was interested when Seth Rogen (“The Boys”) took the reins of the franchise and promised fans the animated movie of a lifetime. I, as an avid fan of more modern TMNT content like the 2012 and 2018 series, walked into the theater praying not to be disappointed, and my prayers were answered. With a genius cast, wonderful visuals and a great new take on the origin story of the heroes in a half shell, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is one of the best animated movies of this year.
First and foremost, the movie’s animation style is the most captivating part of this entire film, showing dedicated line art and a neon-noir aesthetic often found in urban settings. The unique style of the movie focuses on color and lighting contrast, as the blocky settings and powerful palette make the film stand out from the rest. The character designs are also cartoonish yet intricate, having an elaborate and exaggerated outline of misshapen body parts. This is highlighted by the sheer creativity in the depiction of several classic TMNT mutants, from the interpretation that the mutants all formed at the same time to the ridiculously creative designs of even the most minor villains. From Michelangelo’s (Shamon Brown Jr., “The Chi”) football-shaped head to Superfly’s (Ice Cube, “Straight Outta Compton”) many-legged build to Leatherhead’s (Rose Byrne, “Insidious”) Australian crocodile nature, every individual has their own idiosyncrasies that make up who they are. And don’t even get me started on the adorable yet absolutely goopy turtle tots, which are hilariously grotesque and yet the cutest and most squishable baby turtles one could imagine.
And of course, the new changes to the TMNT’s universe are intriguing and make for a wonderful story. The changes in the origins of the ooze and its effect on humans, Baxter Stockman’s story and how mutants ultimately interact with the Turtles is more than enough to make for another article in and of itself, but the dynamics among the brothers are ultimately about the same as usual. Unlike most recent iterations where Donatello (Micah Abbey, “Cousins for Life”) particularly has a crush on April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri, “Abbott Elementary”), this time Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu, “The Amazing World of Gumball”) is the one trying to romance her. It’s a refreshing take on Leonardo’s traditionally all-work-no-play personality, where as much as he tries to take after their adopted rat mutant father, Splinter (Jackie Chan, “Rush Hour”), even he is not immune to stereotypical teenage wiles. And similarly to the most recent TMNT iteration “Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” April O’Neil is just a Black high schooler interested in journalism who happens to have her world collide with the Turtles. Not only does her closeness in age to the Turtles make her seem like a more relatable character throughout, but it also helps the audience truly feel like this is a teen-oriented movie rather than adult problems with teenage faces slapped over them. Another incredible thing about the film is that it absolves itself from the Smurfette Principle by adding another strong female character, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph, “Bridesmaids”) into the mix, showing both women’s rights and women’s wrongs.
Of course, everything else goes as one would expect: Raph (Brady Noon, “Good Boys”) has anger issues that he “works on,” Donnie has every nerd stereotype known to man associated with him and Mikey is the chillest turtle mutant one could ever meet. Even so, the new energy that the cast brings into this TMNT iteration was electrifying, leading this movie to possibly have one of the best TMNT casts yet. Especially due to Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and Seth Rogen allowing the main four to record together and improvise, leading to major script changes that allowed for much better chemistry between the characters. This, along with the wonderful East Coast hip-hop soundtrack, provide a fun and exhilarating experience throughout the movie.
Even with all of these amazing factors, there have been a few common complaints. For example, some have commented on the cringe that follows when writing teenage slang into a movie. It’s not great to hear the words “rizz” and “sus” used outside the context of one’s friends, but the realistic depiction of how one would expect a teenager around 16 years old to act is something that brings a sense of naivety and lovability to the characters (again, if it’s something a teenager wouldn’t say, then the literal teenagers improvising those lines probably would not have said it). It shows just how much everything they do is with the intention of living their lives to the fullest, trying to bring change however they can conceive it.
Another one of the most significant new additions is the origin story for Splinter and the other mutants, along with how their stories are mirrored as they come together. Splinter and Superfly are explicitly shown to be foils of one another, with both of them caring for nothing but what the ooze gave them when they were mutated. Both had a family, a people to call their own when humanity refused to accept them. But while Superfly sought revenge, Splinter sought safety — he felt less of a need to hurt others in a world that wanted to hurt everything he cared for, deciding to do everything to protect himself instead. The opposing ideals of fight and flight, hurting or being hurt, seemed to be the only two options in such a black-and-white world. However, the Turtles show that there’s a third option of knowing the risks of the human world but choosing to attempt to live their lives as normal teenagers anyways.
“Mutant Mayhem” is an incredibly fun movie with amazing comic-book-like visuals to match. I rarely truly have fun watching a movie, and yet I was actively shaking my friends and laughing my head off as I watched this movie for the first time. They redefine the teenage experience to be something to enjoy and look out for, something to appreciate and strive for, and it was more than refreshing to see. There should be more fun movies back in the theater, and I’m even more excited for the post-credits scene promising another genius movie following this iteration of our four favorite turtles.

The most loveable of characters
We're also blown away by the incredible attention to detail in bringing these radical reptiles back to life. The creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have crafted a visually stunning homage to the classic TMNT comic book look. They've also made sure the turtles' personalities shine through — flaws and all — making them more relatable and lovable than ever before.
And there's no end to the humor in Splinter grappling with the day-to-day stresses of raising four teenage turtles trying to fit in. That certainly hits us differently now that we're parents ourselves.
Mutant battles to remember

As they navigate the challenges of fitting in and being accepted, they become role models for young viewers, encouraging them to embrace their true selves and celebrate their individuality.
A bond like no other
After all, the heart of the TMNT franchise lies in the turtles' unbreakable bond with each other and their wise rat dad, Splinter, as a chosen family. The dynamic, filled with jokes, camaraderie, and unwavering support, serves as a reminder of the true meaning of friendship.

,‘TMNT’ Franchise Nears Billion-Dollar Retail Year with ‘Mutant Mayhem’ Boost,,"Fueled by the hit animated feature Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — which is just shy of a $95 million global box office since its August 2 release, grossing $15.2M domestically this weekend — the classic property is reportedly on track to surpass $1 billion in global retail sales in 2023. The 40-year-old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles brand created by comickers Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird was acquired by Paramount in 2009, and from 2012-2022 amassed $8 billion.
Directed by Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and co-directed by Kyler Spears, with Seth Rogen serving as one of the exec producers, writers and voice stars, the CG-animated pic has spurred Paramount Consumer Products’ most ambitious licensing efforts for the TMNT brand yet, signing up 400 partners for the film alone (1,100 total for the franchise).
Licensees include top toy and collectible companies Hasbro, Mattel, Playmates, Funko and Build-A-Bear, as well as Crayola, General Mills and Crocs. The Turtle Bros. have also teamed up with hit games Minecraft, The Sims FreePlay, Roblox and more, with one of the more creative partnerships delivering the first-ever pizza-scented game controllers for the Xbox X Mutant Mayhem design.
Retail partners for TMNT include Walmart, Target, Amazon, Macy’s Kroger, Toys ‘R’ Us, Primark and more. Products are available from 550-plus retailers — at 40,000 locations in more than 220 markets around the world.

2023-08-01 16:09:01+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Beg BTS’ Jung Kook Not to Watch Them Sing ‘Butter’ in ‘Mutant Mayhem’ Teaser,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sing BTS' 'Butter' in a teaser for the upcoming 'Mutant Mayhem' animated movie reboot.,"It’s right there in the name: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So, given that said bony-shelled reptiles are right in the demo, it’s fitting that in a new promo for the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that is out on Wednesday (Aug. 2), Leo, Raph, Don and Mikey are unabashed members of the ARMY.
“This is it, guys,” Raphael laments in the 20-second clip in which the foursome are lashed to a giant bomb-like device that seems to spell their demise. “Oh, so many regrets,” he groans. “I just wish I could see BTS IRL,” says Donatello.
Leonardo, of course, has a creative idea, offering, “We could do some of the songs for you,” he says, with Michelangelo adding that he’d be down for a few bars. Leo then gets the gang started, singing the first lines of BTS’ global No. 1 smash “Butter,” while encouraging the others to join in. But, given their predicament — they are lashed to a wall by their wrists and ankles — the song comes out as more of a cry than a croon.
It’s all a bit sad, honestly and Don complains that they don’t even really know the words. To be fair, the tweet of the clip had a very stark warning message: “Jung Kook please don’t watch this.”
In addition to the four turtles (voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon), the film also features the voices of Rogen, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph; Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote and co-produced the film directed by Jeff Rowe.

Anticipation for the upcoming CG-animated reboot, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023), couldn’t be higher. The film received a standing ovation at the Annecy Film Festival last month, followed by more positive reactions at an early private screening held by Paramount Pictures. With the film just weeks away, fans are excited to see their half-shell heroes like never before.

Taking inspiration from Sony’s Spider-Verse movies, the film showcases a striking animation style. While the Ninja Turtles are no strangers to the world of animation, with three cartoons, a CG-animated show, a CG movie, and a bunch of video games under their belts, Mutant Mayhem has already set itself apart.
The two trailers for the film have also left fans excited, despite a select few threatening to boycott the film for portraying April O’Neil as African-American. But Mutant Mayhem has faced other criticisms in recent months (of the healthier variety) for not including the Ninja Turtles’ arch nemesis, The Shredder, who has appeared in four of the theatrical films so far, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze (1991), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016), as well as several TV iterations and beyond.

Producer Seth Rogen and director Jeff Rowe decided to take a slightly different direction with their film. Not only are the Ninja Turtles portrayed as young teenagers, which means they likely won’t meet The Shredder for some time yet, the focus, just as the title suggests, is mainly placed on the mutant villains from the wider TMNT franchise.
In an attempt to prove themselves to the citizens of New York City and become accepted as people and not “freaks,” the Ninja Turtles will face off against Superfly (Ice Cube), Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Post Malone (Ray Fillet), Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Seth Rogen (Bebop), and Rocksteady (John Cena).
Related: New ‘TMNT’ Installment Finally Replaces Original Four Heroes
Recently, it was reported that a CG-animated TMNT television series in development for Paramount+ would follow Mutant Mayhem, paving the way for a “shared universe”. While this is currently just a rumor, it seems to align with Paramount Pictures’ confirmed plans for several TMNT villain-focused films heading for their streaming service.
So, The Shredder will probably show up somewhere, right? We finally have an answer, because Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe shared some interesting information during a recent interview with SFX magazine. When discussing whether or not the iconic samurai would show up in a sequel, he jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger).

Rowe said he is “100% committed” to developing the franchise further, before talking about the “teenage aspect” of the Ninja Turtles in the film, saying, “We wanted a teenager to watch the movie and feel seen by it and understood. When you’ve grown and you’ve become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you’ve ever seen before, that’s interesting and dramatic.”
“That was our cornerstone for everything,” he went on, “like making the Turtles not hulking, ripped versions of themselves, but lanky and awkward. That carried through into casting actual teenagers. It’s insane that it had never been done before.”
His “hulking, ripped versions” comment is undoubtedly a reference, perhaps even a dig, at the two Michael Bay-produced films from 2014 and 2016, which garnered a lot of controversy due to the Ninja Turtles’ large, hulking designs, as they were quite the departure from any other version that had come before them.

The 2014 film was also criticized for rehashing the same old story: the Ninja Turtles going up against The Shredder, a villain who has been reused countless times over the decades yet was killed off at the end of the original Mirage Studios comic book in the ’80s.
Now, it seems Mutant Mayhem can’t even escape the wrath of The Shredder. As Rowe suggests, he may very well show up in the sequel.

,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' Interview: Ice Cube,"Moviefone speaks with Ice Cube about 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.' It's like joining a championship franchise, he said of appearing in the fi","Opening in theaters on August 2nd is the new computer-animated superhero film ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,’ which was written and produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (‘Superbad’), and directed by Jeff Rowe (‘The Mitchells vs. the Machines’).
What is the plot of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'?
After years of being sheltered from the human world, the four Turtle brothers (Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon) set out on a quest to be accepted as normal teenagers by the people of New York City through acts of heroism. With the aid of their new friend April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the brothers go on a hunt for a mysterious crime syndicate, but trouble arises when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
Who is in the cast of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'?
Moviefone recently had the pleasure of speaking with actor and musician Ice Cube about his work in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,’ joining the popular franchise, his love for the Turtles, playing the villain Superfly, the recording process and bonding with his co-stars.
You can read the full interview below or click on the video player above to watch our interview with Ice Cube, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and director Jeff Rowe.
Moviefone: To begin with, were you a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles before joining this project and what does it mean to you to be a part of this franchise?
Ice Cube: Oh, yeah, a big fan. I’ve been checking them out since the '80s and I took my kids to the movies and dealt with the lunch pails, the bedspreads, the action figures and all that. Remember when Kevin Durant went to the Warriors and they was already champs? It's kind of like that. It's like joining a championship franchise and getting a chance to make a difference. So, it was a dream come true for any actor.
MF: How would you describe Superfly in your own words and was it challenging finding the character’s voice?
IC: Superfly is the King of New York. Everything that's bad, you've got to run through him. You've got to check in, for sure. But he has a heart. He don't want to be an ugly Superfly. He wants friends. He wants acceptance. He just wants people to like him. He just wants to go to happy hour and eat his bowl of sugar and smoke a cigar, man. You know what I mean? It's one of those things where he's a guy you can understand, and if you don't give him that, he tears up New York.
MF: I understand for this film, the recording process was done differently than on other animated movies as you actually got to work with the other actors you were performing with. Can you talk about that process and what was that like for you?
IC: It seemed like all animation should be done this way. You get a different kind of performance when you're in the room with other actors who can match your timing, and you guys can kind of bounce off each other. It's why the film feels so real and natural, and it doesn't feel like the standard animation where you can tell somebody's in a pristine studio, and they're by themselves, and they're trying to make it sound like they're part of a group. This is the way to do it.
MF: Finally, did that process allow you to bond with the four actors playing the Turtles, and what was it like for you working with them?
IC: Very cool. All of them have great energy. All of them have great voices. When you think of animation, you think of people with amazing voices. How do you have a voice that's perfect for a cartoon, especially when they're young? I'm always amazed at these perfect voices that are chosen in animation, not just ‘Ninja Turtles,’ but most animation, they find the people with the most unique sounding voices that's usually perfect. So, I like listening to them talk.

2023-07-30 06:00:22-07:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: This Turtle-Verse Is Gnarly,"Aaron Neuwirth reviews Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, a very entertaining, irreverent, and stylish new take on the heroes in a half shell.","Well, that was refreshing. No, not representation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles brand, which, between movies and TV shows, has never moved out of the spotlight for kids since 1987. What’s invigorating is the sense of life and energy found in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which wants to emphasize the “teenager” aspect, as well as the stylized animation used to represent this latest iteration of the comic series by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. No, it’s still not aiming for the dark, black & white Daredevil parody this series began as on the page, but the irreverent antics and very modern sense of humor provide the feel of something made for kids by kids at heart (and the adults who can vibe with it, as the kids say).
A brief prologue and a pretty funny retelling by Jackie Chan’s Splinter remind us of what happened. A canister of ooze (a scientific term for goopy experimental gunk) fell into the sewer and managed to spill onto a rat and four young turtles. The rat, Splinter, became their father figure and would go on to teach his adopted children the arts of ninjitsu. Banned from letting their presence be known to humans and only allowed to leave for the surface for supplies, the teenage-aged turtles are restless as they become more curious about the world above them.
This is all standard for TMNT, but even before getting into the major gimmick for this film from a plot standpoint, just watching and listening to Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo banter is a highlight throughout the film. Producer and co-writer Seth Rogen made the wise decision of having the four young actors record together, and the results add real life to these characters. Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, and Shamon Brown Jr. shine throughout, as they are actual teenagers who bicker, talk over each other, make jokes, and laugh in ways that feel like the best sort of version of “here’s the point of the scene, now improvise the dialogue to reach that goal.”
The spirited energy of these performances is matched by the unique animation style, which once again feels like the results of a studio taking the right notes from the Spider-Verse films. Director Jeff Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears (who both worked on The Mitchells vs. The Machines, which has its own connections back to Spider-Verse) have assembled the right crew to deliver a film that looks not only like concept art but the sort of art that comes from a youthful mind. Backgrounds have scribbles on the buildings and other elements, shapes are all irregular, there’s a minor lean into some anime for inspiration, and it all makes for an exciting experiment in 3D animation, to say the least.
Even as an action film, there’s so much going for this take on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as it’s clear Mutant Mayhem is inspired by not only kung-fu flicks but Jackie Chan films, in particular. The way this film manages to get around our heroes using their deadly weapons, for instance, involves a lot of work to have the surrounding environments provide obstacles for the turtles and their foes. This movie has about as much action as it needs, but it’s creative and builds in ways that also speak for the film’s growth in its characters.
Speaking of characters, so here’s the deal, compared to, say, yet another Superman movie where the villain just has to be Lex Luthor or General Zod, Mutant Mayhem is leaning into the expansive rogue’s gallery that’s been developed in the TMNT universe and using it to build a whole cavalcade of characters for our heroes to either bounce dialogue off of or ninja skills. In doing so, why not cast a variety of talent to supply the various comedic beats and one-liners. Ice Cube, Rogen, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Hannibal Buress, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, and most hilariously, Paul Rudd all pop up to voice the likes of Superfly, Bebob, Rocksteady, Leatherhead, Wingnut, Ray Fillet, Mondo Gecko, and other fan favorites. Yet, it never feels like gratuitous fan service.
There’s a method to having all of these characters featured, but the film never feels overcrowded. If anything, the story is pretty thin compared to the character work for the turtles and Splinter. It ultimately amounts to one of the mutants wanting to assemble a weapon that could take on the humans (who most of the mutants dislike). Not that it’s uninteresting, but as with most TMNT plots, it will ultimately come down to the Turtles saving the day from their latest villain.
The way to make that more compelling is to dig in on the key characters. For example, this is the best theatrical TMNT movie for shaping Leonardo as the group leader. He’s honorable and takes things seriously, as usual, sure. However, Mutant Mayhem doesn’t forget that he’s still a teenager and can become self-conscious. Not hurting is the choice to keep Raphael away from the typical sarcastic persona constantly challenging Leo. Instead, he’s brave but impulsive, and gets along with everyone.
In addition to how the turtles function, Splinter and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) get neat arcs to play with. With Splinter, it’s about his role as a father and his justified prejudices regarding how he feels about humans. We’re far from the times when Jackie Chan was just being fed one-liners that he didn’t understand in Rush Hour, as he brings a good amount of heart to scenes requiring him to show care for his children. Meanwhile, this version of April is a high schooler and aspiring reporter who aims to prove herself to the other students following an embarrassing situation. It’s simple but effective, without losing sight of the wonder she has from involving herself with her new friends.
If anything, this whole film gets by largely on how much of a positive message it wants to share about helping people and its attitude in capturing innocence as well as a capacity to grow one’s understanding of the world. While there’s an eventual showdown between the Turtles and a key villain, the path in getting to the finale is aided by the choices rooted in how the characters have been developed and what’s the most logical path to take amid all the silliness, action, and other antics fueling the movie’s momentum.
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention the music and soundtrack for this film. The score comes from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who once again show how adept they are at letting their industrial style seamlessly blend with whatever they are after. Meanwhile, the tracks chosen for the soundtrack heavily emphasize 90s east coast hip-hop tracks that were likely all favorites for Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg when they were growing up. M.O.P., De La Soul, O.D.B., Naughty by Nature, A Tribe Called Quest, and more, are all featured. It really helps create a special atmosphere that belongs to this specific iteration of TMNT.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem delivers a lot of fun. More radical dudes than reptiles with attitude, the joy and spontaneity of teenagers portraying the characters opens up what one can do with this franchise. Adding an assortment of wacky villains and a look for its animation style that is unlike anything else only adds to why it stands out. Focusing on the innocence of adolescence over attempting to subvert superhero movie tropes, enough works in this film’s favor to hope there’s more in the works for these heroes in a half shell.

Instead of a bus, Neeson is trapped in an SUV with his kids, and can’t risk getting out or pressure triggers will cause the vehicle to explode.
Neeson, at a still-robust age 71, has spawned a genre of minding-his-own-business guy that is forced to seek vengeance by circumstances ever since his first such film, 2008’s Taken. This latest offering fits neatly into that pantheon.
More from Deadline
In the film, Neeson is compelled to engage with an anonymous voice on his cell phone, a character that sends him across the city to execute a series of violent demands.
The film includes appearances from Matthew Modine, Noma Dumezweni, Jack Champion, Lilly Aspell and Embeth Davidtz.
Retribution, from Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions, is in theaters Aug. 25. Watch the trailer above.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will be hitting theaters on August 2, and while the trailers for the CG-animated reboot have led us to believe that it’s aimed primarily towards younger audiences, along with diehard fans of the TMNT franchise, it seems that we may be underestimating just how emotional the film’s going to be.
Mutant Mayhem is the seventh theatrical outing for the Ninja Turtles, following Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993), TMNT (2007), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016).

However, as it’s reboot, it isn’t connected to any of the previous two sets of films — neither the original four installments nor the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. This means that Mutant Mayhem is free for a complete do-over, in its visual design, storytelling, characters, and overall tone and feel, all of which it’s certainly taken advantage of.
But while the trailers suggest that the TMNT reboot will live up to its name — there’s a lot of “mutant mayhem” taking place, as the Ninja Turtles take on a new wave of villains in the hope that New York City will come to accept them and welcome them as their own — the filmmakers, from producer Seth Rogen to director Jeff Rowe, are adamant that this is actually a coming-of-age story, having even previously compared it to the likes of Stephen King’s Stand By Me (1986).

There’s room for both, of course, but right now it’s tricky to see how a film that looks so comedic and action-heavy — perfect ingredients for a Ninja Turtles outing, sure — will also be able to satisfy audiences on a deep emotional level. Well, director Jeff Rowe is convinced that it will be “shockingly emotional”, and that audiences will leave theaters in tears!
In the latest issue of Total Film magazine, here’s what he had to say:
“There were a lot of things that were skated past, and we took a lot of time to make it really operate from a place of character and relatability that, I think, will be shockingly emotional. The goal early on in our conversations with [co-writer] Seth [Rogen] were: ‘We want people to leave the theatre, and be like, ‘I can’t believe I just cried at a Ninja Turtles movie.'”

Ever since the TMNT reboot was first announced in 2020, we’ve known that it will lean heavily into the “teenage aspect” of the four Ninja Turtles, which has become increasingly evident in recent months, particularly with the reveal that Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael will, for the first time in TMNT history, be played by actual teenagers.
It hardly sounds like a movie adaptation of the dark and gritty comic book series “The Last Ronin” (2020), but having any Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie that resonates with the audience on an emotional level can only be a good thing.
Recently, an early screening of the film at the Annecy Festival received a six-minute standing ovation, so clearly the filmmakers have done something right.

2023-07-31 15:01:18+00:00,"'TMNT' Co-Creator Confirms Disappointing News for ""Last Ronin"" Fans - Inside the Magic","It might be a great week for 'TMNT' fans, but this is bad news.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will likely take theaters by storm over the next few weeks. This year has seen its fair share of blockbusters take a massive slice out of the box office, including Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023). However, it’s animated films that seem to be the dominant force of cinema in 2023.
Across the Spider-Verse (2023) caught $682.4 million on its web and became Sony Pictures Animation’s highest-grossing film, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.355 billion worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing animated films ever.
Needless to say, the CG-animated Mutant Mayhem stands a solid chance at success. The film is also being heavily marketed in a similar fashion to Barbie (minus all the many shades of pink, of course), which echoes “Turtle-Mania” from the early ’90s.
In fact, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures are so confident Mutant Mayhem will turn in a huge profit that they’ve already announced the film is the first installment in a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set to follow the movie on Paramount+ this year.
So it makes sense that Nickelodeon isn’t letting anything stand in the film’s way — not even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
It turns out Nickelodeon is king when it comes to the TMNT property, so much so that they appear to have already stopped another Ninja Turtles reboot from hitting the big screen, likely because it may interfere with the new Mutant Mayhem universe.
That reboot is “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020)…
What is “The Last Ronin”?
“The Last Ronin” is an ongoing comic book series from IDW Publishing, which has been churning out TMNT comic books since 2011. The series follows lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo as he embarks on a one-way revenge mission to take on the man responsible for the deaths of his three brothers in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City.
The series now also has a follow-up titled “Lost Years,” which details the preceding years in which Michelangelo embarks on a quest to become the Last Ronin while, in the present day, introducing four brand-new Ninja Turtles, Odyn, Yin, Moja, and Uno, who are under the tutelage of newly-appointed sensei, Casey Marie Jones.
At this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that “The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution” (2023) will arrive later this year.

Is “The Last Ronin” in a different universe?
“The Last Ronin” takes place in an alternate timeline now dubbed the “Ronin-verse.” However, it’s reasonable to consider that it follows on from the “present-day” IDW material, which is still ongoing.
The Ronin-verse is already expanding in the form of follow-ups such as “Lost Years,” the one-shot comic “Lost Day,” and the upcoming “Re-Evolution,” and also with many collectible action figures. There’s also a “Triple-A” video game in the works, although most fans would prefer a theatrical adaptation.

Will there be a “Last Ronin” movie?
Since it arrived in 2020, TMNT fans have been clamoring for a big-screen adaptation of “The Last Ronin.” In fact, fans have wanted a dark, gritty theatrical outing for well over three years. After all, this is the style and tone in which the Ninja Turtles first started in Mirage Comics, co-created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984.
Unfortunately, it looks like “The Last Ronin” won’t be getting the big screen treatment, or the small screen treatment for that matter — at least not anytime soon.
In an interview with ComicBook.com, Kevin Eastman discussed the fact fans have been hoping for a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” but explained that Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route instead.
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
While Nickelodeon could easily adopt DC’s “Elseworlds” strategy, which isolates films such as Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) from its shared universe installments, it looks like the universe established in Mutant Mayhem is their number one priority.
This may come as very disappointing news for fans of “The Last Ronin,” but there is a short, CG-animated, fan-made film on YouTube worth checking out. And then, of course, there’s the upcoming video game based on the ongoing comic book series.

When is “The Last Ronin” game out?
There’s currently no release date for “The Last Ronin” video game, though we do know it is inspired by the popular God of War video game series.
Earlier this year, Doug Rosen, Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said the game would focus only on Michelangelo. However, he added that Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, who only appear in the comics through hallucinations and flashbacks, may also appear in a playable format in flashback sequences.
Rosen also said that the mature themes of The Last Ronin (TBA) would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be.”

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) has put TMNT back on the map. While the franchise’s popularity hasn’t waned much since its heyday in the early ’90s, the franchise hasn’t seen this much success on the silver screen since the original 1990 live-action film became the most successful independent film of all time (for nine years).
The latest reboot is impressing audiences and critics, and has taken a big slice out of the box office. For many fans, though, Mutant Mayhem is bittersweet. It’s no mystery that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a darker side, which is how it started in the original Mirage Studios comics in 1984, a trend that has continued through all the various publishers.

IDW Publishing currently holds the rights to TMNT in comics, and it’s been churning out volumes since 2011. But in more recent years, the focus has been on the R-rated TMNT comic book series, “The Last Ronin” (2020), a gritty tale set in a futuristic New York City, in which lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo is on a mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and father, Master Splinter.
The comic book was such a huge success that it shot to the top of The New York Times bestsellers list. This year, we got a follow-up series titled “The Last Ronin — Lost Years” (2023), and a third series was recently announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans have fallen in love with “The Last Ronin” so much they’ve been crying out for a big-screen adaptation since it arrived.

Recently, the Facebook fan page Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.com shared a status calling for Christopher Nolan to direct The Last Ronin movie. There’s even an impressive fan film on YouTube based on “The Last Ronin” from “Speedokaggen.”
Unfortunately, though, The Last Ronin movie is unlikely to happen, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman has confirmed that such a project isn’t on the cards. In a recent interview with ComicBook.com, he explained how Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route for “The Last Ronin” instead.
Here are his full comments from the interview:
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
It comes as no surprise that Nickelodeon is choosing to focus on the more family-friendly side of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the big screen and the small screen, rather than “The Last Ronin”, whose latest issue (“Lost Years” Issue #5) contains R-rated violence. After all, it’s the more universal appeal that has made the franchise incredibly lucrative since the original cartoon series in 1987. Recently, it was confirmed that Mutant Mayhem is being developed into a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set for Paramount+ later this year.

The Last Ronin Synopsis
The Last Ronin video game is an adaptation of the comic book series. While “The Last Ronin” comic books are ongoing, with a third series starting in December, Doug Rosen, the Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said earlier this year that the game would focus only on Michelangelo. There was no mention of the four new Ninja Turtles officially introduced in the “Lost Years” series.
As per IDW Publishing, here’s the official synopsis for “The Last Ronin”:
Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost.

Other than being compared to God of War, a third-person action-adventure video game, unfortunately, we don’t know anything about the gameplay for The Last Ronin. However, when it was first announced earlier this year, Doug Rosen suggested that Ninja Turtles, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, who are dead at the time of the story, could appear in a playable format in flashback sequences, which is how they appear in the comics, as well as in the form of Michelangelo’s hallucinations.
Rosen also added that there are opportunities to make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games for both young and older audiences, emphasizing that The Last Ronin would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be,” referring to the adult-themed nature of the comics.

2023-07-31 15:47:30+00:00,"Seth Rogen Refuses Marvel Role, Afraid of Studio - Inside the Magic","Actor-director-writer Seth Rogen is scared of Marvel Studios, but his reasoning actually sounds pretty sound.","Seth Rogen is one of the biggest names in comedy, but it turns out that he won’t work with Marvel Studios because he’s too afraid of the giant comic book film studio.
That is a bit funny to think about, considering Seth Rogen is an incredibly well-known and influential writer, producer, and director and has been a beloved performer since he was literally a teenager. However, it seems that, at least in part, the Lion King (2019) star is intimidated by the idea of teaming up with the world’s most reliable source of mega-blockbusters (up until recently, at least).
In a recent interview with Polygon, Seth Rogen revealed his reason for not having worked in the Marvel Cinematic Universe up until now: “Honestly, probably fear.”
Related: Seth Rogen Hits Back at Haters Following ‘Ninja Turtles’ Trailer
That is pretty refreshing candor for the producer of the upcoming animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen continued by saying, “We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan [Goldberg] have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.”
Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen have indeed been working together for most of their careers, co-writing Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008), The Green Hornet (2011), and This Is the End (2013) and working together on numerous other projects.
Rogen also went on to reveal that his own need for control over a project probably also has something to do with it, saying, “It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with? And what’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this. So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!”
Related: Seth Rogen Shares Surprising Details on His ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Reboot
It is worth noting that Marvel Studios has been known in the past for exerting strong primary control over projects, with President Kevin Feige long acknowledged as the primary creative voice of the Marvel Cinematic Universe over individual directors and stars.
In that, Seth Rogen probably has some hunches correct about how he would feel working in the MCU. He should probably stick with Amazon Prime Video, which is apparently a little less likely to interfere.

In an interview with Den of Geek at San Diego Comic-Con, Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe talked about where things might go in the next movie, which, looking at the critical reception for the current film and, more importantly, the box office takings, is inevitable.
“I think a lot of people are gonna want more,” Rowe said. “These characters are so wonderful, this casting is so wonderful, you just love spending time with them. The Turtles’ world is a big one. There’s a lot left to explore. Conversations are happening, and it would be really exciting to let these characters keep on living and breathing.”
One of those conversations is undoubtedly centered around the Turtles’ iconic arch nemesis.

Warning: there are major spoilers ahead for Mutant Mayhem!
During a mid-credits scene, the Ninja Turtles, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), are adjusting to life at Eastman High with their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri).
However, it’s revealed that TCRI head Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who earlier in the film failed to extract the Ninja Turtles’ mutagen-blood to create an army of mutant soldiers, has surveillance on our half-shell heroes. Before the scene ends, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder, who we see standing in the dark near Brooklyn Bridge.

In a recent interview with SFX magazine, when discussing whether or not The Shredder will show up in Mutant Mayhem 2, Rowe jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger), who was missing from the first film in the series, Batman Begins (2005).
Fans hungry for another slice of Ninja Turtles won’t need to wait long, though. Paramount has already greenlit a 2D animated series for Paramount+ later this year, titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2023), that will follow on from Mutant Mayhem, as part of a planned TMNT shared universe.

The mid-credits scene confirms that The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2. He may even show up in the 2D animated series, but it’s likely Nickelodeon will want to save the silver samurai for the silver screen.
While The Shredder is a somewhat exhausted villain, we’ve no doubt that the “Mutant Mayhem-verse” will offer a fresh take on the character, just as the first film has done with its roster of mutants. But which other iconic villains from the wider TMNT universe do we need to see in the sequel?
The Shredder
Many fans would argue that you can’t have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (or show) without The Shredder, the franchise’s most iconic villain. But Oroku Saki was actually killed off in the first volume of the original Mirage Studios comic books in the ’80s.
Be that as it may, the 1987 cartoon series immortalized the character, as he went on to appear in numerous iterations on the small screen, in comic books, video games, and four out of seven of the theatrical movies (not counting Mutant Mayhem‘s mid-credits scene).
Now that we know The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2, it’s high time for something very different. While the Michael Bay-produced 2014 live-action film gave us a “Transformer” version of the character, we’re hoping for something a bit more subtle.

The Foot
You can’t have The Shredder without the Foot (known also as the Foot Clan or the Foot Soldiers). His legion of ninja followers are often depicted as wearing black bodysuits to blend in with the dark, and with large, bug-like eyes on their masks (a bit like Spider-Man).
The Foot are hardly the front and center of TMNT‘s extensive rogues gallery, but they’re just as iconic as The Shredder, largely because they’re so heavily associated with him. Assuming Mutant Mayhem‘s version of The Shredder is a ninja, then the Foot are a no-brainer.
In the mid-credits scene, we only see the side of The Shredder’s helmet, and the spikes on his shoulder pad. He certainly looks like a ninja, but whether or not he’s Oroku Saki remains to be seen. But as Splinter (Jackie Chan) isn’t the Hamato Yoshi version, who shares a history with Saki, it’s unlikely.

Krang
For many fans, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) remains a bit of a mystery. This is understandable, because Mutant Mayhem doesn’t reveal much about her, other than the fact she heads up TCRI, and wants the Turtles’ blood to create super-soldiers.
In the mid-credits scene, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder to help her capture the Turtles now that they’re in high school and surrounded by people, as opposed to living in the shadows. But who is Cynthia Utrom?
Well, we know the word “Utrom” is the name given to Krang’s species — yes, the Krang, from the many cartoons and comic books and live-action movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) — and we know that they love to make mutant armies.
Cynthia Utrom’s human form is probably a robot, with a Krang operating from the inside, who is most likely female, especially when you consider that the mutants Leatherhead (Rose Byrne) and Wingnut (Natasha Demetriou) are female versions of past iterations.

Baxter Stockman
While Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) already appears in Mutant Mayhem’s opening sequence, there’s plenty of room for him to appear in the sequel. The tricky part is that Stockman is (apparently) killed before the opening credits, but he could always show up in a flashback sequence, or some kind video diary footage.
The sequel may even reveal that Superfly (Ice Cube) is the same person as Baxter Stockman. In previous iterations of TMNT, Baxter is Superfly, as part of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like mutation storyline, however, in Mutant Mayhem, both characters are entirely separate. As far as we’re told anyway, as Superfly’s hair looks suspiciously similar to Baxter’s.

Casey Jones
We know what you’re thinking: Casey Jones isn’t a villain. But Mutant Mayhem doesn’t appear to be following the TMNT playbook all that much. For starters, most of its mutant characters were born as animals, such as Superfly, Bebop, and Rocksteady, whereas in previous iterations they are humans who are transformed into mutant animals.
And don’t get us started on all the lore the film completely ignores, from Splinter’s backstory with The Shredder, which seems to have been thrown out of the window, to the fact that the Ninja Turtles end up in high school. A bold and admirable direction, for sure, but loyal to the TMNT mythology this film ain’t. This could work in its favors, though.
Casey Jones, the hockey stick-wielding vigilante, could be introduced a villain, which would create an interesting dynamic between Casey and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and in turn, the Ninja Turtles.

2023-08-13 12:09:46+00:00,'Mutant Mayhem' Actor Open to Returning in 'The Last Ronin' Movie - Inside the Magic,The 'Mutant Mayhem' actor is open to reprising his role in 'The Last Ronin' movie.,"This Mutant Mayhem actor wants to return for The Last Ronin movie.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is the latest iteration of TMNT in film. But unlike previous entries, this time all the focus is on the teenage aspects of the Ninja Turtles, while the film is easily the most family-friendly of all seven.
So, fans hoping for a dark and gritty take on the half-shell heroes, particularly those who are familiar with the ongoing comic book series, “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) from IDW Publishing, may walk away understandably disappointed.

While Mutant Mayhem is heavily marketed towards younger audiences, none of the films, or the numerous television shows, are geared towards adults, save for the original film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). But even that is quite cheesy in retrospect.
A genuinely adult-themed Ninja Turtles reboot, whether it’s on the big screen or the small screen, would definitely need to take a page out of the comic books, whether it’s the original run from Mirage Studios in the ’80s, or “The Last Ronin”.

“The Last Ronin” takes place in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City, where an older Michelangelo embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter.
A second series titled “Lost Years” (2023) is currently available, and it was announced at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con that a third series titled “Re-Evolution” is in the works, with the first issue available from December. The Last Ronin game is also now in development.

Recently, in an interview with ComicBook.com, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman commented on the possibility of a movie adaptation of “The Last Ronin”, while also sharing some details about The Last Ronin game.
Here are his full comments:
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take ‘The Last Ronin’ concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While The Last Ronin game sounds really exciting, unsurprisingly, when it comes to the big screen, Nickelodeon is clearly more focused on building a Mutant Mayhem shared universe. Not only has a sequel already been greenlit, a 2D animated follow-up series will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.
This isn’t great news for fans hoping for a live-action adaptation of The Last Ronin. Fortunately, The Last Ronin game will remedy some of that disappointment when it’s eventually released.

Either way, the popular comic book series is on the tip of everyone’s tongue, even when it comes to conversations about Mutant Mayhem. In an interview with YouTube channel Nerd Reactor, the brand-new Ninja Turtles actors were asked for their thoughts on “The Last Ronin.” Leonardo actor, Nicolas Cantu, who is clearly a fan of the comic books, was the first to respond, saying, “That is sick! That is sick!”
Brady Noon, who voices Raphael in the film, said to the interviewer, “You are the first person who has mentioned ‘The Last Ronin’!” before asking his co-stars, “Did you see the YouTube thing for it?”, referring to the popular fan film that imagines what a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” might look like.

The interviewer then put a question to Shamon Brown Jr. who voices Michelangelo, saying, “Let’s say, in the future, people love this [Mutant Mayhem], the reception is well, and people are like, ‘Oh man I want to see older Mikey deal with [the death of his brothers!'”
Here’s what the actor said in response: “I would be open to that, for sure. You know the voice gets deeper a little bit and, you know, has to get a bit more gruesome, but it’s going to be amazing. Hey, we’ll see. It could be five to ten years from now, you never know.”
“Are you going to miss us?” Cantu jokingly asked his co-star. “Cuz we’re gone in that storyline!”
While Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael are indeed dead at the time “The Last Ronin” takes place, they still appear in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, so there would certainly be room for Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey (Donatello) to appear alongside Shamon Brown Jr. They’d just need to be considerably older first.
Check out the interview below:
Even if The Last Ronin movie does eventually happen, it’s unlikely any of the Mutant Mayhem actors will ever end up reprising their roles, as Nickelodeon would likely want to keep the film as far from the Mutant Mayhem universe as possible. But who knows. One day, we could get a CG-animated Last Ronin movie as part of the “Mutant Mayhem-verse.”
Either way, who else could take on the role?
Who could play Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie?
Keanu Reeves
Keanu Reeves is no stranger to the martial arts, or taking down hordes of bad guys in neon-lit city settings as he sets out to exact vengeance upon a powerful enemy. If you’ve seen the John Wick films, you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Reeves’ gruff and somber voice would also be perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie.
Michael Shannon
Michael Shannon plays General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) and The Flash (2023), so he has plenty of experience with movies based on comic books. But it’s his role as Mr. Green in the comedy film The Night Before (2015) that oozes those “chilled out” Michelangelo vibes. More importantly, Shannon would bring a ton of grit to the role in The Last Ronin movie.
Chris Hemsworth
Chris Hemsworth also has experience with comic book movies as the God of Thunder, Thor, but we’re looking at his role as Tyler Rake in the Extraction films. Hemsworth also has the physique perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, and he’s also a great comedy actor, which would allow for the more “traditional” Mikey to surface from time to time.
Andy Serkis
Andy Serkis might not be the first actor you think of when casting a character like Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, or any Turtle for that matter. However, Serkis is the king of motion-capture performance, whether it’s Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, King Kong in Peter Jackson’s 2005 epic, or Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy.
Iko Uwais
Iko Uwais is hardly a household name in these parts of the world, but he might just be the most suited candidate for playing Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie. Uwais is best known for playing Rama in The Raid films, the adrenalin-charged Indonesian actioners. The actor’s mind-blowing fighting skills could prove an absolute game-changer .
Noel Fisher
There’s probably no better actor to play Michelangelo than, well, Michelangelo. It would seem unfair to give the character the motion-capture treatment again without considering Noel Fisher, who portrayed him in the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. The Last Ronin version of Mikey, however, would be very different to what you saw in those films.
These actors could even portray Michelangelo in The Last Ronin game, whether it’s through motion-capture performance or voice work. Unless Mutant Mayhem‘s Shamon Brown Jr. is confident about doing that deeper voice.
While there’s no film based on “The Last Ronin” in development, a trailer for The Last Ronin video game was released on Friday. Check it out below:
There’s no release date for The Last Ronin game. “The Last Ronin” comic books are all on sale now. The third series, “Re-Evolution”, goes on sale in December.

2023-08-06 14:35:00+00:00,"2023 Domestic Box Office Surges Past $6 Billion This Weekend Due To ‘Barbie’, ‘Oppenheimer’, ‘Turtles’ & ‘Meg 2’ As Strikes Continue – Sunday Update","The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.' Barbie jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in day 14. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Eyes Second With $30M 3-day, $45M 5-day.","Sunday AM Writethrough after Saturday AM update: As the Hollywood labor stoppage continues, the 2023 box office rally rages on, as domestic box office soars past $6 billion, +22% over the same January-August period a year ago. This weekend for all movies stands at an estimated $178M. This is the fourth time in box office history to have four movies cross $25M; the last time was Thanksgiving weekend 2018.
We always knew this weekend would beat the first frame of August a year ago ($92M), and that’s happening at +94%. But the current Friday-Sunday is also kicking the first weekend of August 2019’s $148.99M by +20%, and that’s when Hobbs & Shaw ruled the chart.
Barbie remains box office queen bee with $53M in weekend 3, after a $17M Friday and $20M Saturday. By EOD, Barbie is roughly $40M shy from passing the half billion mark at the domestic box office, with her gross set to stand at $459.4M. A $1 billion running global cume happens today!
That fierce battle for second place we saw yesterday between Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Oppenheimer, and The Meg 2: The Trench is settling down.
The second place winner is Meg 2 with $30M, an amazing one-two punch for the weekend by Warner Bros. No one was expecting Meg 2 to rank in second place. Here’s the takeaway with Meg 2 this weekend: For all those studios clutching their pearls and worried about stars not doing press and looking to dynamite the rest of the 2023 calendar. Meg 2‘s opening was achieved off a screening program campaign, with in-theater and online trailers and TV spots. I hear that Jason Statham and the cast didn’t do that much press here in the U.S. Such is the plus of opening a sequel off the gas of its established IP. The first Meg‘s campy comedic marketing campaign five years ago already did the heavy lifting in establishing the brand. The sequel’s trailers just needed to run with it.
Beamed Jeff Goldstein, Domestic Distribution President of Warner Bros, “This is an extraordinary time for Barbie fans, as the blowout parties continue. Meg 2 delivered the one-two punch and scared audiences everywhere.”
Uni’s Oppenheimer is third with $28.7M. Since opening, per EntTelligene, Barbenheimer, has pulled in 55.5M moviegoers. Broken out, that’s 39M for Barbie and another 16.5M for Oppenheimer.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, after a great Saturday of $10.3M, +11% over Friday’s $9.3M, is coming in at $28M over 3-days and $43M, which is still great for this $70M production.
Wow, that was easy. Everyone played nice. Typically, when there’s a tie in an upper ranking, especially No. 1, it’s a game of chicken among the majors on Sunday morning when calling it. More specifically, there’s a delay in reporting, with snarking all around. One of the more notorious fights over first in recent memory was the weekend of Sept. 29-Oct. 1, 2017 when the opening of Tom Cruise’s American Made, the fourth weekend of It, and the second weekend of Kingsman: The Golden Circle were all ranking in the high $16M range. Kingsman won with $16.935M.
Turtles is a huge win for the Brian Robbins Paramount administration, particularly as he builds out and revives franchises.
Said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s domestic distribution boss, “We’re over the moon with this opening. We exceeded pre-release expectations with this movie, which has been a labor of love for a long time.”
The decision to revive Turtles happened back in 2018, when Robbins was at Nickelodeon with Ramsey Naito, current president, Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation, and they sparked to the idea of Seth Rogen’s involvement, as well as filmmaker Jeff Rowe — both lifelong fans — who truly wanted to lean into the ‘teenage’ part of the IP. Paramount, like all their movies this year, has gotten behind promoting the animated pic 200%, having Rogen show off extended footage at CineamCon, and a work-in-progress cut at Annecy back in June. Props to Paramount: They were the only studio who realized that there would be a full-house crowd down at San Diego Comic-Con: fans unfazed by the strikes. So they took Turtles down to Hall H and showed off more footage to fans with Rowe in tow, as well as TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman — the latter who just stoked the crowd. Why skip an opportunity? Very smart on the Melrose lot for being fearless and creative sans stars in their promotion. Rival studios, take note.

The second animated take of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak audience score of 88% positive and a 70% recommend, with kids under 12 giving it 94%, and a 69% must-see. That’s enough ooze to keep chugging into the fall. That’s on top of the pic’s already “A” CinemaScore. Men showing up at 60% to women’s 40%, with 56% of the crowd between 18-34. The biggest demo is 18-24 at 34%. Diversity demos are 33% Caucasian, a great 33% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black, and 16% Asian/other. The South Central and the West are the most robust here for the Nickelodeon/Point Grey production. Oppenheimer still has Imax, but the Turtles have PLFs, which are driving 16% of ticket sales and another 11% from 3D. Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing movie theater in the nation at $103K-plus so far. Cowabunga.
TMNT:MM saw Canada delivering 5% of the gross with major markets that over-indexed being L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin, while the only major markets that under-indexed were Seattle and Toronto. Top theaters came from L.A., N.Y., Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, Pharr, Texas, El Paso, Nashville, San Antonio, and Houston.
Social media analytics corp RelishMix says that Turtles’ social media universe is 309.8M across Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok combined. Ahead of release, RelishMix said those stats were under family animated averages. But clearly there’s an appetite here for the movie, as it’s greatly over-performing.

PostTrak audiences gave Meg 2 72% in the top two boxes, with a 55% recommend, and a B- to the first chapter’s B+. South Central and South are the biggest-grossing regions. Note, there’s a lot of walk-up business here, like there was on the first movie, from the Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who are showing up at 25% to Caucasian 41%, Black 15%, and Asian American at 13%. Warners does have some PLFs for the shark that are shared with the Turtles, accounting for 22.5% of the overall gross with another 18% coming from 3D screens. The Regal Fresno Riverpark is leading the pack with $39K in gross (including early shows) so far.
RelishMix counts a social media universe for the sequel of 350.8M, 14% above genre averages next to action-adventure sci-fi titles, with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on the high end at 611.3M SMU. “Chatter flows positive on The Meg 2, which makes new waves as the audacious, over-the-top shark sequel being hailed as a high-octane escape into ‘stupid-crazy-fun entertainment’ with endless positive snarky threads. The return of Jason Statham draws a splash as fans gush, ‘Looks amazing, especially with Jason Statham in this epic shark movie.'” reports RelishMix.
Jason Statham, who counts 111M fans on social media, got this modest plug in for the film on Instagram before the SAG-AFTRA strikes began:

FRIDAY MIDDAY: The third weekend of Warner Bros’ Barbie at $51M (-45%) is higher than the opening of the Brad Pitt action movie, Bullet Train, which did $30M during the first weekend of August. It just goes to show how far we’ve come along at the box office. The Greta Gerwig directed take on the Mattel doll is eyeing a third Friday of $16M at 4,178 theaters, -45% from a week ago. Running total by Sunday will be $457.4M.
Universal’s Oppenheimer will hold on to third place at 3,612 theaters with a $7.8M third Friday (-42%), and third weekend of $27M, -42%, sending its running total by Sunday to $226.8M. Pic is director Christopher Nolan’s fourth highest domestic besting Batman Begins and Dunkirk. It’s also the highest grossing R-rated film of 2023 domestically ahead of John Wick Chapter 4 ($187.1M). Oppenheimer also reps the fastest Universal R-rated release to cross $200M in U.S./Canada, taking 15 days. Previous R-rated $200M Uni champ was 2012’s Ted, which took 37 days to that benchmark.
Third at 3,858 theaters is Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with a first Friday of $8.5M, 3-day of $27M, and 5-day of $42M, well ahead of its $30M-$40M expectations. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is 94% to go along with that A CinemaScore.
Warner Bros‘ The Meg 2: The Trench at 3,503 theaters is a seeing an $11M Friday, including previews, and a $25M opening — robust for the marketplace. Audiences are so-so on it so far at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s better than the 43% the first movie notched with RT crowds.
Disney’s second weekend of The Haunted Mansion at 3,740 is seeing a second estimated Friday of $2.8M,-72%, second weekend of $9.5M, -60%, for a running total of $42.5M.
FRIDAY AM: Barbie Crosses $400M, Oppenheimer Nears $200M, Turtles 2-day $15M, Meg 2 Previews $3M+ The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.’ Barbie, after a $11.8M Thursday, jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in her 14th day –faster than Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie– with a running total of $406.4M at 4,337 locations.
She’s poised to make around $55M in her third weekend, with Oppenheimer ringing in at least another $23M+; all of this spelling for a 3-day box office marketplace that will be exceedingly well north of last year’s $92M for the first weekend of August. The Christopher Nolan-directed movie earned $5.58M yesterday at 3,647 theaters taking its two-week total to $199.86M.
Warner Bros. also has some lagniappe at the weekend box office with The Meg 2: The Trench which is expected to do between $20M-$30M. Last night from previews that began at 3PM, the shark sequel did $3.2M at 3,400 locations. That’s a pretty good result for a sequel that stars a shark: The first Jason Statham movie brought in $4M in previews before churning out a $16.6M Friday, and $45.4M opening off what was a very campy, satirical marketing campaign. The $129M costing Meg 2 has a 50% stake from China’s CMC. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes loathe the sequel at 28% worse than the first movie back in 2018 at 45%. It’s a popcorn film for the masses, not for the tweeds.
Meanwhile, Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem saw its 2-day box office rise to $15M. Thursday was $4.87M at 3,513, -52% from Wednesday, with the Jeff Rowe-directed animated movie ranking third for the day.

Disney’s Haunted Mansion ranked fourth on Thursday with an estimated $1.6M at 3,740, -10% from Wednesday for a first week take of $33M. The previous Eddie Murphy 2003 movie opened on a Wednesday over Thanksgiving and its first seven days grossed $35.4M (unadjusted for inflation).
Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom booked at 3,411, did $1.47M yesterday, -6%, for a running four week total of $156.4M.
A24’s horror movie Talk to Me at 2,340 theaters did an estimated $1.2M yesterday for a first week of $15.8M. Granted, this title went wide versus A24’s Bodies Bodies Bodies last summer, which platformed, but it’s great to note that this Sundance acquisition has outstripped that Pete Davidson horror comedy’s total stateside cume of $11.4M. Talk to Me‘s first seven days are also 22% ahead of Midsommar‘s which stood at $13M and finaled at $27.4M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Ramsey Naito: Paramount/Nickelodeon “Absolutely Committed to Making Original Animated Films”,,"In a brief interview in Variety discussing animation strategy, the new pic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and her own career arc, Nickelodeon Animation & Paramount Animation President Ramsey Naito clarified a statement made by Brian Robbins about the future of original animation at the studio which caused some uproar in the toon community.
In a cover story for the trade, Robbins was quoted saying, “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come.” Filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro and Christopher Miller — evangelists of the ‘animation is cinema’ message — took to social media to decry the implied abandonment of non-IP films.
Noting that Robbins was “one of the creators who really helped define the [Nickelodeon] brand” and his instatement as CEO of Paramount was a major factor in her decision to join the studio, Naito clarified that Paramount/Nickelodeon is not cutting original concepts out of its animated feature slate.
Acknowledging that “we [at Paramount] have to be careful about the concepts we decide to embrace for theatrical and make sure they are big and juicy and that there’s hooks in them,” Naito explained:
“We are absolutely committed to making original animated films and are in development on a handful of projects. Brian and I believe we are nothing without fresh voices, faces and narratives and it’s our responsibility to add new perspectives, modern characters, and vernacular to our culture of storytelling. Originals speak authentically to today’s audience, must be handled with care, and make their own mark in our legacy library… and hopefully stand the test of time. That said, we’re not a one-size-fits-all kind of studio and our budgets are designed to support the scope of our storytelling.”
For those curious about Nick’s mega-IP, SpongeBob SquarePants, Naito also shared that the SpongeBob Universe will continue to expand with more spinoff series and a raft of movies in the works for both Paramount+ streaming and theatrical release. Paramount/Nickelodeon has Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie directed by animation newcomer Liza Johnson (Elvis & Nixon, The Last of Us, A Series of Unfortunate Events [2019]) slated for 2024, and The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants helmed by veteran animator/SpongeBob comics story writer Derek Drymon (Hotel Transylvania: Transformania).
“The next one is going to be set in the deep sea, somewhere the series has never gone before. And the plan is that, like Avatar 2 or Wakanda Forever, we’re going to be immersed in this extraordinary underwater world,” Naito revealed.

2023-08-01 19:59:00+00:00,How a call from Seth Rogen convinced Ice Cube to join Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,All it took was one sentence to get the actor/singer on board with the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles project.,"Editor’s note: All interviews for this story were conducted prior to the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
How much convincing did it take for Ice Cube to sign on to the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem project?
“One sentence,” Ice Cube said with a smile. “It was like Seth [Rogen] calling me, ‘Hey, Cube! I’m doing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, man. I’ve got a character for you.'”
That character is the movie’s big bad guy, Superfly. As you’d expect, Superfly is just that: a fly. He leads an army of mutants — featuring the voice talents of Paul Rudd, Post Malone, Hannibal Burress, John Cena and Rogen — that go head-to-head with everyone’s favorite heroes in a half shell.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: #MutantMayhem “crushes for every age”! Watch the FINAL Trailer and get #TMNTMovie tickets now! See it in theatres everywhere Wednesday, August 2, Sneak Previews start early in select theatres this Saturday, July 29. https://t.co/ysUtySWkv1 pic.twitter.com/Lnl6PCJWk0 — TMNT (@TMNTMovie) July 27, 2023
Early returns from sneak previews over the weekend indicate that the movie is headed for success. As of August 1, Mutant Mayhem sits at 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with 74 reviews.
“It was a no brainer,” Ice Cube said. “I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It’s like being drafted on a winning championship team dynasty. You would be a fool to turn this down.”
From the jump, Ice Cube connected with Superfly, even if the drawing didn’t quite match up with what he had in mind. “I thought when [Seth Rogen] said Superfly, I thought it was pimp hat. I thought it was Cadillac, and then he sent me to picture, and I’m like, ‘Oh, damn, he is a super ugly fly.’ I knew I could make him cool and make him the kingpin that he is running New York and causing mayhem.”
Ice Cube is not new to acting, having starred in roles from Friday (1995) to Anaconda (1997) to 21 Jump Street (2014) and many in between. He’s also an old pro in the recording studio, including his work on N.W.A.’s Straight Outta Compton (1988), It Was a Good Day (1992) and You Can Do It (2007).
But acting in the studio? That’s a bit of a different beast. One that Ice Cube enjoyed immensely. “I just went in the booth, put on my cape like I usually do like. In hip hop you’re in there by yourself most of the time anyway,” Cube explained. “What was cool is he had us working together. So, I was working directly with the turtles. And you know, it made for better voiceovers and better interaction.”
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hits theaters nationwide on Wednesday, August 2.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZnR3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtaWNlLWN1YmUtc3VwZXJmbHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-03 12:00:51+00:00,New 'TMNT' Installment Finally Replaces Original Four Heroes - Inside the Magic,The new 'TMNT' installment isn't all that interested in the original half-shell heroes...,"The latest TMNT installment has just been released, and it’s finally broken new ground for the franchise.
“TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) made waves when it first arrived back in 2020, becoming a critical and financial hit, storming to the top of The New York Times best-sellers list, and transforming the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise forever.
The story finds the lone surviving Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo, embarking on a one-way mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter, in a futuristic and dystopian New York City.
Related: “Footage” Surfaces For R-Rated ‘TMNT’ Reboot, Marvel Star Was Set For Lead Role
Now, fans are poring over the second, five-part series “The Lost Years” (2023), the prequel/sequel to “The Last Ronin”, which expands upon “the lost years” that precede Michelangelo’s long-awaited return to New York, while also introducing the Turtles’ “replacements.”
The end of the first series sees Michelangelo successfully avenge the deaths of his three brothers after a bloody battle against New York City dictator Oroku Hiroto (The Shredder’s grandson). However, he is also fatally wounded in the fight.

But the final scene reveals that April O’Neil’s daughter, Casey Marie, a pivotal figure in the rebellion against Oroku Hiroto, has started to raise four baby mutant turtles in the original Ninja Turtles’ sewer lair, and this is where “The Lost Years” picks up.
It would be a lie to say that the current series is split halfway down the middle where its prequel/sequel commitments are concerned. Any focus on the four new turtles, Odyn, Moja, Yi, and Uno, is limited to only a handful of panels in each issue.
Related: Will the Live-Action ‘Ninja Turtles’ Reboot Be All-Female?!
But this isn’t a criticism — undoubtedly, the creators are drip-feeding these new characters into our lives without shifting the focus from Michelangelo entirely. The last original Ninja Turtle will most likely be gone forever once this series ends.
Each issue leaps forward three years, so by the time we arrive at Issue #4, the new turtles are, as the story describes, “pre-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But unlike the previous three issues, they’re now finally being trained on how to fight by their sensei, Casey Marie.

While their scene in the latest TMNT installment is just as fleeting as those in previous issues, it’s great to finally see them in action, even if the fight does turn out to be nothing more than a simulation, with Casey preparing them for the real world above.
It’s also likely that the final issue, which releases in late July, will feature more from them, which makes sense given that “The Lost Day,” a one-shot comic that hits shelves in late August, will follow these them in their entirety, as they officially replace the original Ninja Turtles.

IDW Publishing’s main “TMNT” comic book series is still ongoing. At the same time “The Last Ronin,” which takes place in an alternate timeline, is also set to continue, as co-creator Kevin Eastman previously confirmed that a third series is already in development.
But while the primary canon will continue, it seems fans are far more interested in “The Last Ronin.” Not only are waves of new toys based on the dark and gritty comic book series hitting shelves, but a brand-new “AAA game” is in the works, which is said to be heavily inspired by the Gods of War game series.
As per IDW, here’s the synopsis for “The Last Ronin — Lost Years”:
RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In the smash-hit miniseries TMNT: The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time — past, present, future — to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half Shell. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heart-breaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artist Ben Bishop (TMNT: The Last Ronin) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of… Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

As per Wikipedia, here’s the official synopsis for Mutant Mayhem:
After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a notorious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.

Universal Orlando Resort debuts the first-of-its-kind blaster game attraction, Illumination’s Villain-Con Minion Blast, as well as the expansive new Minion Land on Illumination Ave. at Universal Studios Florida. Created in partnership between the visionary teams at Universal Creative and Illumination, the new experiences will invite guests of all ages to step into the beloved world of the Minions franchise like never before as they blast their way to supervillain stardom, savor flavorful fare courtesy of the Minions, meet some of their favorite characters and so much more.
Located at the entrance to Minion Land, Illumination’s Villain-Con Minion Blast blends immersive sets, interactive game-based technology, custom animation and an original storyline to create a one-of-a-kind blaster attraction where guests can put their villainous skills to the ultimate test.
Upon entering the attraction, guests will immediately be transported to Villain-Con — the largest convention for villains around the globe — where the headlining event is a challenge to see who has what it takes to become the newest member of the notorious supervillain group, the Vicious 6, featured in the hit film, Minions: The Rise of Gru. As guests make their way through the convention, they’ll venture through the trade show floor, stocked with the latest gadgets, vehicles and fashion to pull off the most heinous schemes, before picking up an “E-Liminator X” blaster to compete against their friends, loved ones and fellow guests to prove how bad they really are.
Throughout the competition, guests will use their blaster — equipped with Freeze Rays, Banana Bombs, Explosive Nunchucks and more — to cause as much mayhem and destruction as possible to earn points. As they wind and glide through the experience aboard a moving pathway, they’ll encounter each member of the Vicious 6, voiced by the original cast from the film, in a setting inspired by their character, including:

The more guests play and the higher they score, the more perks and bragging rights they’ll earn. Plus, this digital experience connects to the visitor’s Universal Guest Account within the Universal Orlando app — unlocking a deeper connection that enhances their in-park experience and sets the stage for even more digital-to-physical world benefits.
In addition to enjoying Minion Land’s Despicable Me Minion Mayhem attraction and new Villain-Con Minion Blast, guests can fuel up with a unique dining experience at Illumination’s Minion Cafe, a new eatery run by the Minions featuring inventive, family-friendly fare; Bake My Day, a retail location and bakery featuring a unique selection of Minion-themed sweet treats; Pop-A-Nana, a kiosk featuring banana-flavored popcorn; and Freeze Ray Pops, a walk-up window serving colorful frozen treats.

Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake
Warner Bros. shared a trailer and announced an August 31 release date for Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake, a more adult spinoff of the classic Cartoon Network series. The show follows Fionna the human and Cake the cat, who first appeared in the third season of the original Adventure Time.
Synopsis: “Fionna and Cake – with the help of the former Ice King, Simon Petrikov – embark on a multiverse-hopping adventure and journey of self-discovery. All the while a powerful new antagonist determined to track them down and erase them from existence lurks in the shadows.”
Rick and Morty: The Anime

,Here’s how the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would do in a real-life fight,"Could real-life adolescent reptiles learn martial arts, like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? A scientist explains.","Here’s how the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would do in a real-life fight
You could be forgiven for thinking that the idea of teenage turtles who mutate into humanoid ninjas is a tad far-fetched. But you may be shell-shocked to learn that actually, in reality… it is.
“First of all,” says Jeanette Wyneken, professor of biological sciences at Florida Atlantic University, “the chromosomes of a turtle and of a human don’t match up. Turtles have more chromosomes than we do. And if your chromosomes don’t match up, you often end up with genetic abnormalities called a ‘teratology’, a term that literally means monsters.”
But let’s ignore all of that. Let’s suppose, somehow, there are mutant turtles that stand on two legs and say things like, “cowabunga, dude”. Would their turtle physiology be able to adapt to humanoid anatomy?
“One big change,” says Wyneken, “is that their centre of gravity would shift from their shoulders (while on four feet) to their hips when they stand on two.” For a conventional four-legged turtle, this would mean toppling over from the weight of their shell, but “for humanoid turtles it’s not much of an issue,” says Wyneken, “because it would be more like a human wearing a big backpack.”
The major difference, however, is that when a human wears a big backpack, that backpack doesn’t also contain their ribs and spine. Whereas with turtles, the vertebral column is part of the shell; they can’t take it off. According to Ivana Lezcano Serra, Wyneken’s graduate student researcher, who specialises in turtle shells, this fact makes the new animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem difficult to take seriously.
“In the trailer, they’re jumping around and doing all of these acrobatic stunts. But that fusion between spine and shell would make that very difficult,” she says. “They simply wouldn’t have the kind
of flexible spine that would allow them to do backflips.”
So they can’t be mutants and they can’t be ninjas. Can these turtles even be teenagers?!
“The new movie really focuses on the fact that they’re young teenagers,” says Lezcano Serra, “and that poses a problem for their abilities. The older turtles get, the more developed and ossified their shell becomes. They have more mineral in the bone. Younger turtles – their shells aren’t going to be as hard. It’s not going to protect them as much as they would probably want.”
Even as adults, their shells wouldn’t be bulletproof, says Lezcano Serra. “They’re not like Captain America’s shield. Shells protect turtles against things like shark attacks, but what a lot of people don’t appreciate is that it isn’t through strength, but flexibility. Steel can resist forces 1,000 times better than a shell can. A shell is more like a squeezy ketchup bottle: it deforms and then gets back into shape.”
This flexibility not only applies to their shells, but also to their diet and environment. Red-eared slider turtles – the subspecies that the TMNT were originally based on – “can live just about anywhere there’s water and food,” says Wyneken, including the sewers of New York. But what of the teenage turtles’ favourite food, pizza?
“Red-eared slider turtles eat a variety of things,” says Wyneken. “The cheese may not be great for their digestive system. The carbs in the crust? Maybe in limited quantities. The vegetables would probably be fine. Turtles will eat tomato; just don’t give it to them in the form of pizza. Could they eat pizza and survive? I think so. Could they eat it and be healthy? Not in the long run.”

,I Tried To Get My Kid Into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles And Learned That Nostalgia Is A Two-Way Street,Do kids care about our '90s nostalgia? One writer entered a 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' pop-up experience to see if kids today love the turtles as much kids of the '90s did.,"My five-year-old son knows worrisomely little about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. His knowledge of the heroes in a half-shell is a mixture of conjecture and second-hand information and I fret about the cultural touchstones of his childhood. He has seen a commercial or two and has friends who are into the Turtles, so he tells me he knows that they’re “turtles who are teenage and very good at fighting.” And eat pizza? “Oh yeah … They’re in love with pizza? I think.” He’s bluffing. The kid didn’t know about the pizza.
This information gap is understandable. To a rising first grader in 2023, there’s a glut of franchises to glom onto. There are Marvel kids, Minecraft kids, Pokemon kids, Rainbow Ranger kids, Ninjago kids, (still) Star Wars kids, and even the occasional TMNT kid; whose dads are apparently better hype-men. But also, for kids these days, brand loyalties are fickle. You can appreciate a bunch of worlds — and that’s ok. You don’t need to be all in. Identities aren’t all that wrapped up in TV heroes or comic book brands.
To this rising first grader in the 80s (not going to let you do that math), this is jarring. After 1988, to me, there were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans — and everyone else. And what’s not to love? Martial arts! Check. Mutants! Check. Old school weapons Mom will let me fawn over! Yup. Bad guys with throwing stars and the ability to ooze into city-crushing giants! Check. Pizza! Pizza!
So obviously I want to get my kid into TMNT — to introduce him to a franchise with at least one movie coming out soon (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, out August 2) and maybe get into the OG animated series that aired from 1987 to 1996 that Nickelodeon confirmed at Comic-Con it has secured the rights to. But I’m not entirely sure how to even start.
He’s not a huge TV watcher, but he gets enough screen time that just showing him a show isn’t going to guarantee he’ll be into it — or even want to watch more than one. The glut of options has led to a discerning viewer. He may decide the Turtles are too weird — or, worse, not weird enough. That they’re too violent and scary — or just the opposite, silly and unseriousness. It’s hard to tell where he’ll go with it. He could reject it so quickly and casually because he is a kid in a candy store, entertainment-wise. This is the paradox of all the choices our kids have now with streaming: It’s tough to be a dad today looking for a cartoon bonding opportunity. When we were kids, we got into shows and movies, and books because those things were simply there.
But, out of the ooze, an opportunity arose. In Los Angeles and New York City, the city I call home, a TMNT pop-up came to town, marketing the coming Mutant Mayhem movie and giving kids and adults an experience that is custom-built to get their butts in seats. Or so I hoped. Honestly, movie marketing pop-ups like this can be a hit-and-miss kind of thing. You might expect Hollywood Studios, but usually, you get Chuck E. Cheese. Knowing this, I tempered expectations a bit, took him out of summer camp early, and we headed on a northbound train.
Is this the making of a fan? At the least, it’s paving the way for some good bonding.
We talked Turtles on the way and I found he was skittish about the coming movie. Perhaps he was feeling around to see if there were other options. Maybe he knew enough to know that the bad guys can be pretty bad when there are mutant animals involved. “Well, it’s one of the better movies for the two of us to see together in the theaters next month,” I truthfully told. He seemed open to the idea.
So I escorted him to the “sewers” located in the Meatpacking Districts of Manhattan and guided him into the smoke machine-filled hallways that were supposed to represent the home of the four heroes in half shells. He got all wide-eyed and quiet — in that way a 5-year-old does when testing their bravery. He walked past the pipes and through hanging wires, tons of ‘90s detritus he didn’t notice — unspooled cassette tapes, old TVs playing the 1989 side-scrolling TMNT NES game; catnip for this grown kid — when Donatello’s cartoon aperture dove down, projected on a wall. I could see my son jump, then relax. Ah, good guys, his body language said and he moved through these sewers more confidently. I felt he had turned a corner on the whole franchise. He was in.
Remember when Pizza Hut was the most dominant marketing force in our lives? Long live physical media. INFO 1/2 { PREV NEXT }
All things told, there was some fun. Punching bags, a throwing star area, and more cartoon baddies but always in fast relief with the turtles. Like a ride at a theme park, it all went remarkably fast and before we knew it, we were at the end, or adventure over.
Did my kid think the Turtles were cool now? He was a little unconvinced, I could tell. It was fun, but confusing to someone who just doesn’t know why this nostalgia is well nostalgic. And as we’re looking to leave, I see the thing that had cemented it all for me: Turtle action figures. That’s it! That will hook him!
My mind dives back to my Donatello — my favorite, always — whose perfect plastic figurine would punch (or chop?) with a squeeze. This guy took a licking and was always a solid protagonist in my basement rec room. The toy that was my real memory, I’m now realizing as I stare at a cornucopia of colorful figures on skateboards, in the plush, riding in the pizza van. More than the show, the movies, the entirely weird world, and limited character arcs of these pizza-loving mutants, the toys were it to this once and future kid. My son looked upon them fondly. Skateboards, pizza mobile, cool outfits, movement, and soft weapons. The toys were solid. Finally, there was a whole fun thing here we both understood.
We left and silently walked up the street to, of course, a pizza joint I had picked out ahead of time. Over a ginger ale and a slice, I asked, “So what do you think?” He took a bite, pondering (or half listening) to my question. “When’s the movie again?” he asked. “Next weekend we can go,” I say. “Cool. Do they have the toys there?” “We’ll see.”

In support of the property's newest movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the group has even convinced one of the country's largest pizza companies to test out a new method of pizza dlivery. Wednesday, Pizza Hut announced it has tested the method of underground deliveries.
Given the Turtles are based in an abandoned subway station, the pizza chain used the subway lines of Manhattan to deliver pizza to select New Yorkers in the test. A video of the test can be seen below.
""Pizza Hut and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a longstanding history that goes back to the '90s. Bringing the two together again for a new generation was a no brainer, "" Pizza Hut chief marketer Lindsay Morgan offered in a press release. ""With this new collaboration, we wanted to pay homage to the Turtles' origins and their love of pizza, while also infusing modern touchpoints and a fun, creative take on pizza deliveries – in real life and through augmented reality gaming.""
The subway test isn't the only promotion with movie either. Beginning immediately, a new AR-based mobile game called TMNT: Pizza Power has launched, allowing people to deliver pizza to the turtles in hopes of scoring real-world pizza and prizes. You can play that game here.
The pizza place will also be featured in some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem television spots as the marketing for the film begins to ramp in the weeks ahead of its theatrical release. Last but not least, the chain announced it will also be appearing in the movie itself with a ""several scene"" integration.
The synopsis for the animated blockbuster is below.
In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts.

2023-07-27 03:16:43+00:00,Trailers : Bleeped and Non-Bleeped Version of Strays trailer,,"Universal have released a second trailer for Strays, out August 17.
There’s both a safe for work and NSFW version here.
They say a dog is a man’s best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style.
When Reggie (Will Ferrell), a naïve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose.
But once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Oscar® winner Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is.
Determined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug’s pals—Maggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner’s new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who’s stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal—together hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home … and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It’s not his foot).
A subversion of the dog movies we know and love, Strays, directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal), is a hilarious, R-rated, live-action comedy about the complications of love, the importance of great friendships, and the unexpected virtues of couch humping.
The film features a powerhouse comedic supporting cast, including Grammy winner Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast), Harvey Guillén (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish), Emmy nominee Rob Riggle (The Hangover), Brett Gelman (Stranger Things), Jamie Demetriou (The Afterparty) and Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara (Modern Family).
Strays is produced by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord p.g.a and Christopher Miller p.g.a, (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part), by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig p.g.a. (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Lord Miller’s Aditya Sood p.g.a. (The Martian, Cocaine Bear), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans) and by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal).
The film is executive produced by Nikki Baida, Doug Merrifield, Jessica Switch and Julia Hammer. Universal Pictures presents a Lord Miller/Picturestart production.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWVob2xlLm5ldC90cmFpbGVycy1ibGVlcGVkLWFuZC1ub24tYmxlZXBlZC12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXN0cmF5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 16:14:41-04:00,‘We don’t want to be Kenemies’: Movie theatre releases trailer appealing for return of stolen Barbie poster,A movie theatre in Oakville decided to get creative after their security cameras captured the theft of a promotional poster for the Barbie movie over the weekend.,"A movie theatre in Oakville decided to get creative after their security cameras captured the theft of a promotional poster for the Barbie movie over the weekend.
Film.ca Cinemas, located on Speers Road, posted a satirical movie trailer titled “Barbie Heist” to their Facebook page, which appears to show a male suspect stealing three posters from their display cases at the front of the theatre.
The cinema says the theft occurred just after 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, and the thief made away with a poster for the Barbie movie, ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ and ‘Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part one.’
Film.ca CEO Jeff Knoll told CP24 on Tuesday that they released the trailer in the hopes that the thief would bring the posters back, but so far, they’ve had no luck.
“The video just went up yesterday and we're hopeful that somebody will step forward and return the posters,” he said. “More importantly, the message we're trying to deliver is; please stop victimizing our theater.”
Knoll says that the theatre has dealt with a number of vandalism incidents over the past few years, including the theft of two ATM boxes which were dragged out with chains, damaging the theatre’s front doors, as well as the slashing of multiple cinema screens.
“We've had graffiti, we've had property theft, catalytic converter theft, we’ve just had a string of things happen to us since the pandemic and we just really want to say enough is enough,” he added.
“If you're going to come after us, we're going to make you famous, effectively.”
Knoll says he deliberately hasn’t gone to the police with a theft complaint because he doesn’t want to tie up their resources with what he says is a relatively minor crime.
“We've gone to the police with most of the previous ones, but this is a fairly petty theft and I happen to also serve on the Halton Police Board and I know how expensive our police resources are,” Knoll said.
“So I've made the decision not to pursue it through a police investigation that would cost thousands of dollars. I think that the punishment in this particular case is this person, his friends and family are going to know who he is from the video, I don't think there's any question about that.”
Knoll says the posters were initially provided to the theatre free of charge from the film’s production studio, but cost about $25 each to replace.
“But the poster like the Barbie poster would sell on eBay or Kijiji or one of those auction sites for quite a bit more because that's a popular movie,” he added.
“Maybe not so much the Haunted Mansion poster, which is why that one was left behind.”
The thief was also apparently not interested in the poster for Christopher Nolan’s latest blockbuster, ‘Oppenheimer,’ as it was also left behind.
Knoll delivered an on-air message to the alleged poster thief on Tuesday afternoon, saying the cinema simply wants its posters back.
“You made a bonehead move, we're tired of these things happening to our business. Bring the posters back, and, you know, we'll let bygones be bygones,” he said.
“But make no mistake about it, if you're going to victimize our business, you're going to be called out on it.”
Based on the security footage provided by the theatre, the alleged thief appears to be an adult male, wearing a white hooded sweatshirt, with a baseball cap, grey shorts and crocs. The suspect was also seen driving away in a black hatchback.
“To the Barbie thief,” said Knoll in the Barbie Heist trailer, “if you’re watching, we don’t want to be Kenemies, if you would kindly return the posters, that would be more than Kenough.”
“But we do want an answer to the question; did you really not see the cameras?”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcDI0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlLWRvbi10LXdhbnQtdG8tYmUta2VuZW1pZXMtbW92aWUtdGhlYXRyZS1yZWxlYXNlcy10cmFpbGVyLWFwcGVhbGluZy1mb3ItcmV0dXJuLW9mLXN0b2xlbi1iYXJiaWUtcG9zdGVyLTEuNjUxMDg2MtIBMmh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YS5jcDI0LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvOC84LzFfNjUxMDg2Mi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

It’s no stretch to say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has always been a diverse franchise. 1997 saw the first female Turtle, Venus de Milo, in the live-action television series Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (1997).
Since then, there have been even more female Turtles in the long-running IDW Publishing comic book series, from human-turned-Turtle Jennika to the more recent Moja and Yi, who form part of the new line-up in the ongoing “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) series.

Now, the CG-animated reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is set to be just as diverse. Not only is April O’Neil portrayed as African-American (voiced by African-American actress Ayo Edebiri), two TMNT villains are portrayed by female actors.
Those villains are mutant alligator Leatherhead and alien-in-human-form Cynthia Utrom, voiced by Bridesmaids (2011) duo Rose Byrne and Maya Rudolph, respectively. The long-standing character of Leatherhead has previously been portrayed as male in the many TMNT iterations, while Cynthia Utrom appears to be a version of the male villain Krang.

Now, we finally have our first look at both of these characters in a new promotional video titled “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — The New Turtles,” in which producer Seth Rogen name-drops all the film’s characters and the actors who play them.

While we only see a still image of Cynthia Utrom (which is part of a series of newly revealed character posters for the film), we see Leatherhead in action, with Rose Byrne’s native Aussie accent, as she says, “G’day, fellas!”
These villains might not be anywhere near as iconic as the likes of Bebop and Rocksteady (who are voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena in the upcoming film), but between this new change-up and the two new female Turtles in “The Last Ronin,” we could end up with an all-female TMNT movie one day.

2023-07-10 16:06:37+00:00,Napoleon trailer gives glimpse of Joaquin Phoenix as infamous emperor,"The American actor will star as Napoleon Bonaparte in the Ridley Scott film, set during the French Revolution.","To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video
Movie fans have been treated to the first full trailer for Joaquin Phoenix’s upcoming movie Napoleon, which will track the conqueror’s rise to power.
The American actor, 48, will star as emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in the Ridley Scott film, which is set in the 18th and 19th centuries.
While Joaquin has featured in two A24 films in recent years, C’mon C’mon and Beau is Afraid, Napoleon will be his first major role since 2019’s Joker – which landed him the best actor Oscar in 2020.
For Napoleon, he will reunite with director Ridley for the first time since Gladiator, which took home the Academy Awards for best picture and best actor.
The footage displays the film’s impressive battle set-pieces and shows scenes of France’s capital Paris during the French Revolution between 1788 and 1799.
The brand new trailer also gives fans their first glimpse at Vanessa Kirby as Empress Josephine, the first wife of Napoleon between 1804 and 1810.
Joaquin Phoenix stars in his first major role since 2019’s Oscar-winning Joker (Picture: Columbia/Apple)
The film will track Napoleon’s military victories in Egypt (Picture: Columbia/Apple)
Several battle scenes are depicted, including Napoleon’s decisive victories in Austria and Egypt, which gained him a reputation as a fierce military commander.
It is set to a cover of Radiohead’s The National Anthem, which was recorded for their number one album Kid A, released in October, 2000.
Characters describe Napoleon’s actions as ‘holding the world hostage’ while Joaquin’s fierce leader says of himself that he ‘simply never’ makes mistakes.
Battle set pieces promise a big screen experience from Ridley Scott (Picture: Columbia/Apple)
Other key cast members include Tahar Rahim as politician Paul Barras, and Ben Miles as Caulaincourt, an adviser to Napoleon.
The film is slated for release on November 24, 2023.
Last month, several members of the crew on Ridley Scott’s planned sequel to Gladiator were rushed to hospital after a ‘fireball’ exploded on set.
According to sources quoted by The Sun, production on the Paul Mescal-starring film was affected when six staff had to be given immediate medical attention.
‘It was terrifying — a huge ball of fire flew up and caught several crew members in its path,’ the source said of the incident.

While the TMNT comics were awesome, it’s this cartoon series that launched the franchise into its popularity. Over the years, Ninja Turtles Michaelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael have gotten several animated incarnations, but that original one was the best!
The series ran for ten seasons and there are nearly two hundred episodes, all of which you can watch on Pluto TV's live channel focusing on the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. While the episodes aren't available to stream ""on demand"", you can jump on in and re-live the earliest animated adventures for the Ninja Turtles! The series will eventually land on Paramount+.
In the series, after being exposed to a mysterious alien substance known as the ""Ooze"", they transform into humanoid creatures and learn impressive martial arts skills. Guided by their rat sensei, Splinter, who was also affected by the Ooze and transformed from a human into a rat, the turtles spend their days training in ninjitsu, eating pizza, and protecting the city from various threats, notably the evil Shredder and his Foot Clan.
The series was a hit among kids and adults alike and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became a major part of 1980s and 1990s pop culture.

The first reviews for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem are in, and they’re pretty gnarly… in the most awesome way possible. The film, directed by Jeff Rowe (Oscar-nominated The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and written by a team that includes Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, currently has a 97% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
It features a star-studded voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Rose Byrne, Hannibal Buress, John Cena, Ice Cube, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph. The titular teenage mutant ninja turtles are voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon.
Watch the final trailer: https://youtu.be/qqc4jJr28w8
The Hollywood Reporter couldn’t sing enough praises of the film as it complimented the visuals, the dialogue and the voice acting. The film “features vibrantly distinctive visuals that perfectly suit the rambunctious and frequently violent proceedings,” they said. “The dialogue proves consistently amusing (not surprising considering Rogen’s participation), and the fact that the young actors voicing the TMNTs were actually teenagers when they recorded their performances infuses a welcome youthful energy to the goings-on. The celebrity performers seem to be having a blast as well.”
“Fans will not be disappointed with any of the decisions here, notably the scattershot animation that feels rough around the edges, stylish, visually surprising and satisfying and anti-CGI blandness,” said Deadline Hollywood, who also praised the story for being “heavy on pop culture humor in all the best ways.”
Indiewire raved that Mutant Mayhem “is another fresh, funny animated outing that breathes serious new life into a classic franchise, proving that even old IP has its legs (claws?)” and called it “a genuinely entertaining film for the whole family.”
“This lively reboot is a raucous collage of influences,” said Mashable. “But whether you’re an expert on the canon or not, the movie sets up all you need to follow its flow. Deep-cut fans will surely pull out references and implications, but newbies won’t be lost amid the flood of characters, in part because their main purpose is to be a tornado of energy, action, and comedy.”

2023-08-19 14:00:48+00:00,'TMNT: Mutant Mayhem' Has Already Made $1 Billion - Inside the Magic,"TMNT: Mutant Mayhem is critically acclaimed and a whole lot of goofy fun, which is probably why it's making all the money in the world.","TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, the latest reboot of the world’s most notable amphibian martial arts crimefighters, is making hand over fist right now and is projected to have already made over a billion dollars. However, not all of that is due to the box office receipts.
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (or TMNT, for time-saving reasons) were created as basically a joke comic book by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984 and seized the world’s imagination almost instantly. At this point, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo have thoroughly transcended their origins as a goofy satire of Frank Miller’s Marvel Comics run on Daredevil and become their own pop culture behemoth.
A big part of the success of TMNT has always been its merchandising. Eastman and Laird sold toy rights to the turtles to Playmates Toys in 1987, which quickly put out a line of action figures inspired by the series. In four years, over a billion dollars worth of TMNT action figures had been sold.
Now, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem has been able to match that gargantuan numbers in a single year.

While the Jeff Rowe-directed movie (who also co-wrote with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit) has crossed the very respectable $100 million line at the box office, Deadline reports that it is estimated to be responsible for at least $1 billion in global retail sales in 2023.
For comparison, the TMNT franchise (which is currently owned by Paramount Global) was able to gross $8 billion in a decade of sales since 2012; the boost of the critically acclaimed movie is apparently moving retail sales into overdrive.
Currently, TMTN: Mutant Mayhem merchandise is available at retailers as widespread as Amazon, Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Kroger, Kohl’s, Mercado Libre, Primark, Smyths, The Entertainer, Soriana, Big W, Iden, and Toys R Us, while Paramount has teamed up with huge brands like Hasbro, Playmates, Crayola, Funko, Crocs, General Mills, and Mattel (which is also having a banner year) to produce movie-specific tie-ins.
It all appears to be paying off because in a year dominated by the twin blockbusters of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem seems to be a canny bit of counter-programming.
It also helps that the movie has a ridiculously impressive cast that includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Post Malone, Hannibal Buress, and Paul Rudd (who is listed in the cast as “Introducing Paul Rudd”). The turtles themselves were voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon.

2023-07-06 21:04:24+00:00,Long Range Box Office Forecast: NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM and MEG 2 Early Prospects; BARBIE Tracking Soars,"With summer movies currently in full swing, this week's update welcomes the addition of August's first major releases in a peak at the final month of the season: The Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","Images courtesy Paramount; Warner Bros.
With the summer movie season currently in full swing, this week’s update brings us through to August with the releases of Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
In addition, this week’s long range forecast offers a significant update on Warner Bros.’ Barbie, listed in the table below. Pre-sales for the highly anticipated adaptation continue to impress, leading The Little Mermaid by a significant margin and comparing favorably to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 at the same point prior to release. Barbie’s head-to-head box office opening with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer continues to drive intense social media engagement for both films.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount Pictures
August 2, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $27M-$36M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $37M-$49M
Domestic Total Range: $101M-$145M
PROS:
The Turtles brand has been successfully reinvented and reintroduced to modern youngsters a few times since its inception in the 1980s, most recently with the 2014 and 2016 live action box office hits. Nostalgia is also a factor here, as older fans are a key driver of interest in this new entry.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, with their production studio Point Grey Pictures, have a solid track record of box office success in recent years, with Good Boys, Sausage Party, and other films. The expectation here is that the creative team will execute a blend of modern and classic sensibilities with an eye towards ensuring the franchise’s endurance.
The absence of any other late summer animated options—or, for that matter, films catering to young males—puts this film in a strong position during the dog days of the season before school starts again. The use of an edgier animation style that embraces 2D and 3D to produce a comic book aesthetic, comparable to Sony’s Spider-Verse films, could further help Mutant Mayhem stand out with fans and young audiences.
CONS:
As seen with last summer’s DC League of Super-Pets, not all animated wide releases based on IP succeed at the box office. Turtles will need to stand out beyond its fan base and generate positive word of mouth to live up to its potential, especially in the wake of several aging franchises underperforming so far this summer.
Premium screen space could still be hard to come by, with other summer releases—like Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning—hoping to regain some of those auditoriums in their chase weeks.
If Disney’s Haunted Mansion breaks out, Turtles could have more competition than it hoped for.
Meg 2: The Trench
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 4, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $26M-$35M
Domestic Total Range: $70M-$105M
PROS:
The first Meg was a sleeper box office hit, opening to $45.4 million and legging out to $145.5 million domestically five summers ago.
The return of Jason Statham should assure the return of both his own fans and those who enjoyed the original.
Meg 2, like its predecessor, is well-positioned in the final weeks of summer movie season. An expected premium screen presence should also give it a boost.
CONS:
Competition could be notable this time around with the aforementioned appeal of Turtles to male audiences of varying ages, plus the potential staying power of other July releases. Titles such as Gran Turismo, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, Blue Beetle, and Strays will aim to get some of Meg 2‘s male moviegoers throughout August.
Historically, and particularly in recent memory, action sequels such as Meg 2 have not always lived up to their predecessors’ box office performances.

Barbie
Warner Bros.’ comedy declines -43% in its third frame with $53.0M, three-peating in first place.
All time, It’s now earned the:
With $459.3M total through 17 days, it now stands as the #24 biggest movie of all time.
On the all time list, it ranks between 1977’s Star Wars with $460.9M (including subsequent theatrical re-releases) and 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron with $459.0M.
It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $574.1M.
However, Barbie is running +17% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 17-day point in release: $390.3M.
Overseas / global
When Margot Robbie originally pitched her vision of a subversive Barbie adaptation, she jokingly told studio executives that it would “make a billion dollars.” Well, it was no joke.
This weekend, Barbie surpassed the 10-digit mark with $572.1M overseas and $1.03B globally.
Globally, that’s already the #45 film of all time.
On the all time list, it ranks between 2017’s Despicable Me 3 with $1.03B and 2016’s Finding Dory with $1.02B.
It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $1.45B.
Barbie’s top overseas markets totals are:
U.K.: $87.9M Mexico: $48.9M Australia: $41.1M Brazil: $39.5M China: $31.7M Germany: $33.7M France: $29.1M Italy: $27.9M Spain: $26.0M Argentina: $13.0M
This weekend, Barbie declined -41% overseas to $74.0M, slightly milder than its -43% domestic drop.
Meg 2: The Trench

Warner Bros.’ shark-themed thriller took a $30.0M bite out of the box office, opening in second place.

That’s -34% below the debut of 2018’s original The Meg: $45.4M, opening in first place.

Audience demographics

Also compared to the The Meg, the sequel’s audience was:

19% under 18, slightly younger than the original at 15%

Rated the film a “B-” CinemaScore, lower than the original at “B+”

Premium formats made up 40% of the film’s receipts, including 22% from 3D; equivalent stats for The Meg weren’t immediately available

The top five locations nationwide include several unusual ones which are basically never in these types of lists:

Regal Fresno Riverpark AMC Empire NY Regal Dania Pointe Ft. Lauderdale Wellfleet Drive‐In Boston/Cape Cod Regal Warren Moore Oklahoma City

Overseas / global

These kinds of films always earn the vast majority of their money from outside the U.S. and Trench was no exception, opening with $112.0M overseas and $142.0M globally.

That’s a hair (less than +1%) larger than the global opening for 2018’s The Meg: $141.3M. That film also opened in only 42 markets, versus 76 for Trench.

In particular, Trench’s $53.3M China opening is +6% above the original’s $50.3M.

Overseas comprised 79% of the film’s global opening. The original ultimately earned 73% from overseas.

Top overseas market totals are:

China: $53.3M Mexico: $7.6M U.K.: $5.1M France: $4.5M Spain: $3.4M Germany: $3.4M Italy: $2.6M Indonesia: $2.3M Malaysia: $2.2M Australia: $2.1M

Oppenheimer

Universal’s historical war drama declines only -38% to $28.7M, slipping from second to third place in its third frame.

All time, It’s now consistently improved by earning the:

Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M



With $228.5M total through 17 days, it now stands as the #172 biggest movie of all time domestically.

On the all time list, it ranks between 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness with $228.7M and 2015’s The Martian with $228.4M.

It also stands as the #12 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 1973’s The Exorcist with $233.0M (including subsequent theatrical re-releases) and 2017’s Logan with $226.2M.

Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.

Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 17-day point in wide release:

-4% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $240.3M -19% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $285.2M -7% behind 2014’s American Sniper : $247.7M -7% behind 2019’s Joker : $247.2M -14% behind 2017’s It : $266.0M

Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film.

It’s already exceeded the final totals for both 2014’s Interstellar with $188.0M and 2017’s Dunkirk $190.0M, and potentially closing in on 2010’s Inception with $292.5M.

Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest films, through the equivalent 17-day point in wide release:

+18% above 2010’s Inception : $193.3M

+89% above 2014’s Interstellar : $120.9M / +21% ahead of its final total: $188.0M

+71% above 2017’s Dunkirk : $133.0M / +20% ahead of its final total: $190.0M

Oppenheimer is also potentially closing in on another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never reach #1 at a weekend box office.

It already ranks #3 on that metric, behind only:

2016’s Sing : $270.3M, peaking at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 2002’s My Big Fat Greek Wedding : $241.4M, peaking at #2 below Signs , Barbershop , and Swimfan

Overseas / global

This weekend, Oppenheimer declined only -31% overseas, milder than its -38% domestic drop.

Oppenheimer has earned $324.3M overseas and $552.9M globally.

That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M, plus it may soon beat Interstellar with $648M, though matching Inception with $728M will prove harder.

IMAX comprises $144.2M, or 22% of the film’s global total.

Top overseas markets totals are:

U.K.: $50.3M Germany: $28.2M France: $24.1M Australia: $18.1M India: $16.1M Mexico: $14.4M Spain: $13.6M Netherlands: $11.2M Saudi Arabia: $10.1M Brazil: $9.6M

Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China, South Korea, and Italy.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot opened in fourth place with $28.0M.

After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $43.1M after five days. Here’s how that compares to other comparable titles, through the equivalent five-day point in release:

+3% above 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $41.7M

+1% above 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $42.4M

-46% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $79.8M

All three of the most recent Turtles films opened in first place.

Audience demographics

Here are a few of the Mayhem audience stats, compared to those for the last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles release, 2016’s Shadows:

60% male, more than Shadows with 54%

34% under 18, skewing older than Shadows with 40%

Rated the film an “A” CinemaScore, higher than Shadows at “A-”

Premium screens comprised 16% of the box office, including 13% from 3D.

Over-indexing markets included L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin. Seattle and Toronto under-indexed.

Overseas / global

In 24 markets, representing only 30% of the overseas rollout, Mutant debuted with $8.5M overseas and $36.5M globally.

Top markets are U.K. with $5.0M and Germany with $1.0M.

Haunted Mansion

Last weekend, Disney’s family horror-comedy failed to spook with a $24.0M third place debut.

That was even lower than 2003’s original The Haunted Mansion with $24.2M, despite two decades of ticket price inflation.

Now in its sophomore frame, the new version drops a steep -63% to $9.0M and fifth place.

Compared to some other family horror-comedies of recent years, that drop is notably steeper than:

2015’s Goosebumps : -34%

2018’s Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween = -38%

2016’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children : -48%

2018’s The House with a Clock in its Walls : -53%

Haunted Mansion has earned $42.0M total, through 10 days.

That’s +8% above 2003’s original The Haunted Mansion through the equivalent point in release: $38.9M. (Although keep in mind that’s after two decades of ticket price inflation.)

Through the equivalent 10-day point in release, it’s also running:

-18% below 2016’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children : $51.1M

-6% below 2018’s The House with a Clock in its Walls : $44.8M

-4% below 2015’s Goosebumps : $43.7M

Overseas / global

Mansion’s holdover markets fell -56% this weekend, a steep drop though still milder than its -63% domestic drop.

Mansion has earned $17.6M overseas and $59.6M globally.

It may fail to reach its 2003 predecessor’s $155.7M global total, although the reboot’s staggered overseas debut hasn’t yet begun in several key markets including U.K., Italy, Australia, and Japan.

Top overseas market totals are:

France: $3.8M Mexico: $2.3M Germany: $1.4M Spain: $1.1M

Outside the top five

Angel Studios’ faith-based action drama Sound of Freedom takes sixth place with $7.0M in its fifth frame.

With $163.4M after 34 days, Sound is certainly the biggest box office surprise of 2023 so far, beating such expected summer blockbusters as The Flash and the new Mission: Impossible.

Indeed, it’s one of the biggest box office surprises of this entire era.

Paramount’s action-adventure sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One takes seventh place with $6.4M in its fifth frame. It’s earned $151.0M through 26 days.

Here’s how that compares through the equivalent point in release, including trailing both of its two Mission: Impossible predecessors:

-17% below 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout : $183.7M

-5% below 2015’s Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation : $160.0M

+11% above 2021’s No Time to Die : $135.1M

-15% below 2015’s Spectre : $177.7M

-68% behind 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick : $480.7M

A24’s horror Talk to Me fell -40% to $6.2M and eighth place in its sophomore frame.

Among horror films, that’s one of the milder sophomore drops of the post-pandemic era. For A24’s horror films specifically, it’s milder than X (-49%) and Men (-64%), and just slightly steeper than Pearl (-39%).

Disney’s adventure sequel Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes ninth place with $1.5M in its sixth frame. It’s earned $170.6M after 38 days.

Through the same point in release, it’s running -42% below 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: $298.4M.

Disney/Pixar’s animated Elemental takes 10th place with $1.2M in its eighth frame. It’s earned $148.2M through 52 days.

Though poised to finish among Pixar’s lowest-grossing theatrical releases ever, it’s exceeded the final totals of 2022’s Lightyear with $118.3M and 2015’s The Good Dinosaur with $123.0M, despite opening below both titles.

Weekend comparisons

Total box office this weekend came in around $174.0M.

Here’s how this weekend compares to last weekend, the same weekend last year, and the same weekend in the last pre-pandemic year of 2019:

Weekend Total This weekend is: Leader Last weekend $213.5M -18% Barbie, second frame ($93.0M) Same weekend in 2022 $92.0M +89% Bullet Train ($30.0M) Same weekend in 2019 $148.9M +16% Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw ($60.0M)

""He wants to rip down a skyscraper.""","The cast of voice actors in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is absolutely stacked. Still, a major standout among the A-list crowd is West Coast rap legend Ice Cube. Playing Superfly—a mutant fly who wants mutants to rule the world over humans—his mutant animal gang also features voice work from Paul Rudd, Post Malone, Hannibal Buress, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and more.

Of course, though, Ice Cube's Superfly is in charge—and he even quotes Ice-T's ""6 in the Mornin'"" in the film, while he's (what else?) pummeling down on our beloved turtles. ""You get to be evil and nasty,"" he tels Esquire in the latest episode of ""Explain This."" Who would like to play the villain? ""But what's cool about Superfly is that he has a heart,"" Cube continues. ""He just wants to be liked, and when you don't like him then he wants to rip down a skyscraper.""

The former N.W.A. member also reminisced about his time filming 21 Jump Street, receiving boos booed when he performed on the East Coast for the time, and a young John Singleton hounding him for two years before agreeing to do Boyz n the Hood. ""I would run into him and he would be like, Yo, I'm a senior at USC, I'm gonna do this movie with you, Cube,"" Cube recalled. ""And I'd be like, Yeah, man whatever.

,TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM Director Wants To Introduce Krang in Sequel — GeekTyrant,,"I’m pretty stoked about watching the upcoming movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem! I’ve seen quite a bit of footage from the movie already, and it looks like a radical fun flick! It’s just such a unique way to tell the story of these beloved characters and I hope that the movie ends up being a success at the box office because it’s be cool if the franchise continued.

If the film does end up sparking a sequel, director Jeff Rowe wants to introduce the classic villainous alien character Krang! During a recent interview with CB, the filmmaker was asked what character he would like to play with in the next chapter of the story and he said:

""Krang. Krang is so interesting to me. The Arnie suit. I'm like, we gotta do something with Krang.""

He didn’t go into any details on how he would incorporate the character into the story, but it would be awesome to see the character incorporated into this reimagining of the franchise. I can only imagine how wild the character design and style would be!

Krang is a notorious character from the franchise and is an alien warlord from Dimension X and is unique due to his form, which is that of a giant brain. Once a feared conqueror in his home dimension, Krang was stripped of his body and banished to Earth, where he allied himself with Shredder and constructed a powerful humanoid exo-suit to house his brain form. Known for his high intellect and less-than-pleasant personality, Krang is consistently working on plans to conquer Earth, often leading to battles with the Ninja Turtles.

Rowe also previously teased Shredder’s future involvement saying: ""We'll Dark Knight it.” He went on to say that he'd 100% love to develop a sequel and shared: ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""

In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.

When previously talking about the tone of the film, director Jeff Rowe revealed the vibe they were going for:. “We wanted it to be like Stand By Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles.”

The voice cast of the film includes Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Jackie Chan as Splinter, John Cena as Rocksteady, Seth Rogen as Bebop, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut, Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Post Malone as Ray Fillet, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, and Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom.

2023-07-31 14:00:15+00:00,August 2023 box office preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ kicks off last month of summer,"August is often referred to as the ""Dog Days of Summer,"" because at a certain point, the box office just dies.","August is often referred to as the “Dog Days of Summer,” and it’s not just because of the intense heat that is permeating the country, but also because at a certain point, the box office just dies, as people go on vacation and others prepare to return to school in September.

This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.

Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.

SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)

The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.

“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)

A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.

“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)

Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.

“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)

Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.

“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)

A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”

“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)

Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.

“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)

Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.

“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)

Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.

“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)

Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?

“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)

Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.

“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)

Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.

Time to get into some limited releases …

“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)

The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.

“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)

Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.

“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)

Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.

“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)

Another popular horror film from this year’s Sundance is Laura Moss’ twist on Frankenstein with the underrated Marin Ireland playing a morgue technician trying to reanimate her little girl using materials from a pregnant woman (Judy Reyes).

“The Adults” (Variance – Aug. 18)

Michael Cera, Sophia Lillis (“Stranger Things,” “Enola Holmes”) and Hannah Gross star in the latest indie dramedy from Dustin Guy Defa (“Person to Person”), playing siblings dealing with the death of their mother. It premiered at Berlin earlier this year, then played Tribeca Festival.

“Bottoms” (United Artists – Aug. 25)

At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.

“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)

This stop-motion animated film written and directed by Jim Capobianco follows the life of Leonardo da Vinci with a voice cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Daisy Ridley, Stephen Fry and Matt Berry. (This is also getting a moderate release in a very busy late August weekend.)

“Scrapper” (Kino Lorber – Aug. 25)

Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) plays the absent father of a child (Lola Campbell) who decides to live on her own after her mother dies in this feature directorial debut from Charlotte Regan.

That’s it for this month. September will be all about the festivals and the official start of Oscar season as the box office tends to slow down even more.

2023-07-20 14:38:07+00:00,THE QUEEN MARY Gets A Haunting New Trailer,,"In May, Vertical announced that it had secured North American rights to the supernatural horror-mystery THE QUEEN MARY from DRACULA UNTOLD director Gary Shore. The film is a psychological horror which explores the mysterious and violent events surrounding one family’s voyage on Halloween night (1938) and their interwoven destiny with another family onboard the infamous ocean liner present day.

Shooting took place aboard the actual Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. A luxury ocean-liner graced by generations of the rich and famous, HMS Queen Mary is now celebrated – and feared – as “One of the World’s Most Haunted Places” (Time Magazine).

Vertical has slated the film for release in Summer 2023.

THE QUEEN MARY stars Alice Eve (Star Trek Into Darkness, Belgravia), Joel Fry (Game of Thrones), Nell Hudson (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), William Shockley (Death in Texas), BAFTA award-winner Lenny Rush (Am I Being Unreasonable?), and more.

In the early twentieth century, shipping lines competed to be the fastest to complete a transatlantic crossing. But among the most famous record-holders was the RMS Queen Mary, which held the record for fourteen years, but now stands encased in concrete at Long Beach, California, where it has been used for many years as a luxury hotel and tourist attraction. The ship has a lengthy history of visitors reporting seeing ghosts and visions in its rooms and on its decks, making it the perfect setting for paranormal goings-on on the big screen. In The Queen Mary, a haunting story is unraveled between the ship’s heyday in the late 1930s and the present and tells the story of two families whose lives become violently entangled.

Stephen Oliver and Tom Vaughan penned the script with revisions by Shore. The film is produced by Brett Matthew Tomberlin (Winchester) of Imagination Design Works, Thorsten Schumacher of Rocket Science, Lars Sylvest, Nigel Sinclair and Nicholas Ferrall of White Horse Pictures (The Woman in Black), and Mali Elfman.

Vertical Partner Peter Jarowey commented, “We were immediately intrigued by the chilling, grisly tale that the filmmakers have woven together in The Queen Mary. We’re sure audiences and horror fanatics will flock to experience it this summer.”

“We were impressed by Vertical’s passion for Gary Shore’s intelligent and twisted take on a great English and American legend. We know this team will be the perfect US distribution partner in logging the next chapter of this vessel’s historic and haunted history,” added the producers.

Vertical’s Partner Peter Jarowey and SVP of Acquisitions Tony Piantedosi negotiated the deal on behalf of Vertical, while CAA Media Finance negotiated on behalf of the production.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJlbW92aWVnZWVrcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy90aGUtcXVlZW4tbWFyeS1nZXRzLWEtaGF1bnRpbmctbmV3LXRyYWlsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES Co-Creator Kevin Eastman Has a Cameo in MUTANT MAYHEM — GeekTyrant,,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman got the Stan Lee cameo treatment in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. His cameo was confirmed by director Jeff Rowe during an interview with /Film.

I’ve seen the movie twice already, but I didn’t catch the cameo until it was pointed out. During an interview, Rowe was asked where Eastman appears given that his name features in the movie’s credits. He revealed the cameo and explains that Eastman wanted it to be meaningful:

“He’s the human who helps Splinter up at the end. He helps him out. And we wanted that to be someone meaningful to the franchise, and we were so happy Kevin was willing to do that. I’m appreciative of the Stan Lee cameos in Marvel films, and it felt like a great way to honor him and the beautiful gift he has given the world.”

Heck yeah! It’s awesome that Eastman got a cameo in the film! He and Peter Laird are the guys that brought these awesome Heroes in a Half-Shell into the world and our lives are better because of it. It’s hard to imagine a world without Ninja Turtles! It’s great that they were able to pay tribute to that in Mutant Mayhem.

2023-07-27 18:46:46+00:00,"Long Range Box Office Forecast: Can NINJA TURTLES, MEG 2, GRAN TURISMO, BLUE BEETLE, and STRAYS Carry August?",This week's report takes a quick look at how August's key releases are shaping up so far as there is no wide release addition to the forecast for the weekend of August 25.,"With no new wide releases coming to theaters for the weekend of August 25, this week’s report takes a look at how the month’s key releases are shaping up.

PROS:

With the sustained holdover success of July releases Barbie and Oppenheimer, August looks poised to be a healthy month overall.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (August 2, Paramount) continues to track well as a late summer animated offering that will appeal to young and older fans alike. Pre-sale trends are well ahead of Elemental and not far behind those of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.

Meg 2: The Trench (August 4, Warner Bros.) provides a late summer, PG-13 action-horror-comedy hybrid for audiences looking to end the summer on a lighter note after the longer, more dramatic genre films that have come earlier. Blue Beetle (August 18, Warner Bros.) hopes to ride the same wave among DC comic fans and Latin American families, while Strays (August 18, Universal) aims for the older audiences on the comedy spectrum.

CONS:

As Barbie and Oppenheimer settle in for leggy runs that could see both films rank highly on the box office chart moving into early fall, their success is likely to overshadow some upcoming releases—especially if the ongoing WGA and SAG/AFTRA prevents studios from marketing those newer films as much as they otherwise would have.

Meg 2‘s marketing campaign has left something to be desired, and early pre-sales reflect a lower initial burst of enthusiasm than seen for its 2018 predecessor. It’s likely to be the most impacted by the current Barbenheimer craze.

Gran Turismo (August 11, Sony) remains a wild card as it hopes to build beyond its core video game fan base. Pre-sales are relatively slow out of the gate.

Blue Beetle and The Last Voyage of the Demeter (August 11, Universal) continue to trend very modestly as marketing begins to ramp up. Strays remains a volatile film to forecast due to reasons mentioned in prior reports.

The final weekend of August is currently without a major studio title, meaning holdovers will have to carry the market before The Equalizer 3 (September 1, Sony) opens for Labor Day weekend.

,"Tortoise rescue asks parents to buy toys, not turtles, ahead of ‘Ninja Turtles’ movie","“After seeing the film and thinking real turtles jump through the air or fly like Ninja turtles, kids ask parents to buy live turtles,” the American Tortoise Rescue said.","article

The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) is urging parents to buy toys, not real turtles ahead of the release of the movie ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.""

According to the rescue, kids often ask their parents to buy live turtles after seeing the film.

""History shows that after the release of a series of these successful Ninja movies, turtles lose their lives through the pet trade,"" ATR wrote on Monday. ""Most of the turtles have been scooped out of the wild to be sold in pet stores or over the internet.""

ATR, which is the first national turtle and tortoise rescue, said the best thing parents can do is to purchase action figure toys that actually mimic the ninja movements from the film.

""After seeing the film and thinking real turtles jump through the air or fly like Ninja turtles, kids ask parents to buy live turtles,"" the rescue continued, adding, ""Sadly, after bringing the turtle home, sticking it in a small tank and waiting for it to perform, kids abandon interest when nothing happens – the turtle just sits there.""

The red-eared slider and box turtle were the most common turtle species purchased by thousands of children who wanted their own ""Ninja"" turtle, after the successful release of previous ""Ninja Turtle"" films, according to Susan Tellem, co-founder and executive director of ATR.

""I like to say putting a turtle in a tank is how we would feel if we had to live in a bathtub all our lives,"" Tellem explained. ""The purchase is often an impulse buy without regard to the fact that turtles can live 25 years or more. Sadly, most of these turtles were abandoned in shelters and rescues or dumped into lakes and waterways (or worse toilets) after the movie’s young fans found out that the real turtles did not fight crime or perform incredible stunts.""

The rescue suggests people only adopt these turtles if they have a private pond where they can mimic their natural habitat.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" which is produced by Seth Rogan, is an animated superhero film featuring the beloved, iconic characters.

After years of being sheltered from the human world, the turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers. The movie is scheduled to be released nationwide by Paramount Pictures on Aug. 2.

2023-08-05 15:28:37+00:00,"Movie review: ‘Mutant Mayhem’ a fresh, authentic take on the ninja turtles","The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.","Radioactive ooze generated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” has helped birth “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the new animated feature about everyone’s favorite rambunctious, pizza-loving reptiles. Directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears showcase the turtles in a way we’ve never seen them before, utilizing a blend of 3D and 2D animation to create a unique, rough-hewn (on purpose) style that suggests children’s book illustrations blended with teenage sketchbooks.

That edgy look is paired with a script that’s funny and fresh, a soundtrack filled with classic New York hip-hop, and a stunning industrial score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.

It’s clear that Rowe, Spears and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (who also produced the film), Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit and Brendan O’Brien, have a deep love and nostalgia for these lovable ‘80s relics, who were ubiquitous in the childhoods of older millennials. These sewer-dwelling rapscallions, raised and trained by a rat named Splinter, were born on the pages of a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. There were toys, a memorable Saturday morning cartoon, and three live-action movies back in the 1990s (who could forget the refrain sung by Vanilla Ice: “go ninja, go ninja, go!”). But the less said about the film adaptations in the 2010s, the better.

‘Mutant Mayhem’ is both a new direction for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a return to the past, symbolically, locating the material in the land of teenage imagination, memory, nostalgia and emotion. The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.

The color palette is dark with pops of neon, giving it an early ‘90s look. Sprinkled throughout are video clips that nod to the cultural touchstones of the creators: snippets of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” a salute to John Hughes, to whose vision of American high school the teen turtles cling, and instructional karate training videos, which is how Splinter (Jackie Chan) teaches his young turtle sons to defend themselves against the terrifying outside world.

The creators get back to basics with the story, focusing on the question of fathers and sons, mutants existing within humanity and the universal desire for acceptance. Splinter, a New York City street rat, is already inured to human rejection when he adopts the four adorable turtles covered in radioactive ooze. He raises them in a loving environment, away from the hustle and bustle (and malice) of the city, and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), grow up in a tight-knit quartet, though they long to be part of the world.

On the other hand is supervillain Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who doesn’t hide from humanity, but harbors genocidal impulses toward the people who have deemed his and his mutant brethren unacceptable. He wants to make every creature on earth a mutant, tipping the balance of power away from the humans and toward the mutants, believing it the only way they’ll find their place in the world.

With the help of intrepid reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the turtles decide to stop Superfly in the hopes that if they’re seen as heroes, they’ll be celebrated and integrated into society in order to fulfill their dream of going to high school (they’re teenagers, they’ve got teenage dreams).

The themes are broad and universal but the writing is remarkable — the dialogue feels natural and authentic to the age group, and it’s filled with modern slang and references to pop culture, rap songs, anime, comedy and more. Their desire for community is a resonant message, but it’s expressed in layered dialogue that feels like the way real teens talk to each other, and it’s beautifully performed by the four actors voicing the turtles.

The filmmakers manage to balance the contemporary feel of the writing and innovative visual style with their own nostalgia for childhood cultural touchstones, which makes “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a fascinating and highly entertaining blend of old and new.

2023-07-02 13:00:52+00:00,First Look for Upcoming 'Stranger Things' Spin-off Revealed - Inside the Magic,The upcoming 'Stranger Things' spin-off has already started to emerge from the Upside Down...,"The first of many upcoming Stranger Things spin-offs will be arriving this Summer, and now, we finally have our first look…

A lot is going on in the world of Hawkins and the Upside Down lately. Stranger Things Season 5 might be facing some significant delays due to the ongoing WGA (Writer’s Guild of America) strike, but that doesn’t mean the franchise isn’t continuing to expand.

There are many upcoming Stranger Things spin-offs in the works: there’s an anime series, a Saturday morning cartoon-inspired series, a live-action series, and a West End stage production arriving later this year called Stranger Things: The First Shadow (2023).

The literary side of the franchise is just as busy. As well as a prequel novel that sees the return of Eddie Munson (played by Joseph Quinn in Season 4), there’s a Stranger Things spin-off comic book crossover event from IDW Publishing and Dark Horse Comics around the corner.

“TMNT x Stranger Things” (2023) will see our young Hawkins heroes team up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in New York City as they battle a new threat that has emerged from the Upside Down. Check out the official synopsis below:

Eleven, Max, Dustin, Mike, Will, and Lucas are looking forward to a nonthreatening, fun-filled trip to New York City. With the gang hundreds of miles from Hawkins, they’re sure to catch a break this time! That is, until they encounter a threat both bizarre and familiar and some allies that are just bizarre! This summer, the kids from Hawkins meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

ComicBook.com has now shared an exclusive first look at the first issue in the upcoming Stranger Things spin-off series, with a series of panels lifted from the first issue showing the Ninja Turtles in action, alongside the Stranger Things ensemble. One key takeaway is that the Turtles resemble their 1980s Mirage Studios counterparts created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.

Artist Fero Pe, who has worked on IDW’s long-running and ongoing “TMNT” comic book series, returns to lend his talents, with Cameron Chittock serving as a writer. You can check out the panels and the incredible cover art here.

During the comic book’s press release (as per ComicBook.com), Chittock said, “I’ve loved the Ninja Turtles for quite literally as long as I can remember, and part of the brilliant alchemy of Stranger Things is that, ever since that first binge, it’s felt like it’s always been there. That’s a testament to [Kevin] Eastman, [Peter] Laird, and the [Matt and Ross] Duffer brothers, who tell stories that grab hold of you and don’t let go. Bringing their creations together is a surreal thrill, and we’re striving to fill every issue with moments worthy of their lofty standards. I can’t wait for fans to join us in 1985 to find out what’s lurking underneath New York.”

Pe added, “It feels incredible to be the artist of ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Stranger Things’. For the art on this project, I wanted to do something unique, inspired by the era when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created and the setting of the Stranger Things series. It’s a style close to the first ‘Turtles’ comics from Mirage. I hope that the fans of both worlds enjoy it very much!”

It’s shaping up to be a busy year for TMNT and Stranger Things. “TMNT x Stranger Things” issue #1 releases on July 12, and Stranger Things: The First Shadow is set to premiere in London’s West End on December 14, 2023.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) releases in theaters on July 31, while the ongoing comic book series “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) will conclude in August with “The Lost Day.”

2023-08-17 09:59:39-04:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate’ #1 is more or less a well-drawn ad for a mobile game,"It's a good time to be a TMNT fan, but is this mobile game adaptation worth a look?","It’s a good time to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan. The Heroes in a Half-Shell have crossed over with nearly every comic property in the universe, in addition to headlining a critically-acclaimed animated movie. Even the world of video games is getting hit with Turtlemania: first, the critically-acclaimed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin announced a game adaptation in development, and now there’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate #1. The one-shot from Henry Barajas, Pablo Verdugo, Gigi Dutriex, and Shawn Lee attempts to be a standalone tale while also leading into the events of the game. How does it succeed on those fronts?

I can’t mince words here: A good chunk of Splintered Fate #1 feels more like a checklist at times than an actual story. A LOT is crammed into 32 pages; the Turtles fight the Foot and Baxter Stockman’s Mousers. Then they have to battle Leatherhead. Then the Foot again. Not to mention the sheer weight of characters: in addition to the Turtles, there’s also Metalhead, April O’Neil, Splinter, Shredder, Karai…that’s enough to fuel at least five issues. Barajas’ script tries to be breezy, but it still feels like there are pieces missing. It also tends to fall back on stock TMNT characterizations: Splinter dispenses wise wisdom, Leonardo and Raphael butt heads, the Shredder is up to no good. Considering that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and the ongoing IDW Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series have taken the franchise in different yet familiar directions, I can’t help but feel a little let down.

Credit: IDW

However, for whatever bumps the script might have, they’re more than smoothed over by the artwork. Verdugo’s artwork is simply gorgeous; there’s more than a touch of anime influence in his designs, which fits the Turtles to a T. The designs also feel unique to each character, particularly our heroes in a half shell. Raphael is the biggest, Donatello has goggles, and Michelangelo is usually shown munching on noodles or pizza. The Shredder looks outright menacing and is covered in blades. Dutriex drenches it all in stunning colors, making sure each Turtle is a different shade of green – which contrasts with the Shredder’s silver armor and flowing red cape. There’s also some great lighting, especially in the opening sequences that feature a high-pitched battle between the Turtles and the Foot Clan against the full moon.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate #1 more or less serves as a giant ad for a mobile game, with stellar art making up for a stock story. Granted the one-shot did its job, as I’m curious enough to check out Splintered Fate. But given how other video games have translated to comics or utilized comics (Especially Fortnite), I feel like more could have been done with this concept.

‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate’ #1 is more or less a well-drawn ad for a mobile game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate #1 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate #1 more or less serves as a giant ad for a mobile game, with stellar art making up for a stock story. Granted the one shot did its job, as I'm curious enough to check out Splintered Fate. Reader Rating 1 Vote 7.3 Kinetic, engaging art with an anime-esque influence. Rich with color. Is enough to pique interest in the Spintered Fate game. Story feels loaded with stock TMNT tropes. Feels more like a fancy ad at times than a full story. 7.5 Good Buy Now Amazon

2023-08-19 10:02:35+01:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,,"What do we talk about, when we talk about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem? What seemed like a dormant big-screen franchise has been successfully rebooted to the tune of $100+ million in a couple of weeks at the global box-office, with a sequel and follow-up series already coming down the sewer pipe in short order. This animated feature rolls back multiple cinematic wrong-turns to double down on the first thing we ever knew about the Ninja Turtles; they’re meant to be teenagers, duh. And being a teenager is about more than shouting ‘Cowabunga dude’ and liking pizza; there’s a world of growing-up angst to be explored, and fortunately the team behind Jeff Rowe’s Mutant Mayhem deliver on that promise of authentic teen voices.

Lines like ‘I know it’s objectively prejudiced but that’s what they taught us,’ flag up early that these ain’t the bland characters we’ve previously known; this is an origin story for the loquacious ‘little Shreks’. It’s also a self-proclaimed ‘tragic backstory’ of sorts; we see the turtles in a lab, getting doused with the mysterious, power-sharing ooze, meeting up with their adoptive rat father Splinter (Jackie Chan) and introduced to tv reporter April O’Neill (Ado Edeberi). Yes, every generation gets the April O’Neill they deserve, and while others made do with Sarah Michelle Gellar or Megan Fox, this April is known as ‘puke girl’ due to her tendency to vomit when nervous. Once assembled, the team are up against extremist antagonist Superfly (Ice Cube), who shares the turtles’ dream of acceptance by the outside world, but seeks it in a rather more direct way…

Mutant Mayhem also resolves multiple issues about the size and scope of a turtle adventure by focusing on the traditionally ignored business of fighting crime; the meat and potatoes of any kind of super-hero, so no time-travel, multiverses, vortexes, portals or any of that nonsense; we’re firmly in scuzzy New York City and foiling robberies is how the turtles aim to win our hearts. ‘You sound like such a leader…that was so heartfelt bro,’ is the kind of cheery dialogue that lays bare the crushing need to be liked that the turtles share as a common cause. It’s not easy to miss the influence of Superbad’s Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg on the funky new direction here, but they generally rein in their cruder impulses in this family friendly feature; they keep it clean AND keep it green. It’s also, in the vein of the Spiderverse animations, impressive to look at, with a knowing super-stoner sound track including Take it To The Limit, Eye Know by De La Soul, Can I Kick it? by A Tribe Called Quest and of course, Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s Shimmy Shimmy Ya.

‘I like your vibe’ says one of their allies Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), and Mutant Mayhem is a movie that surprisingly manages to cause far more of the warm and fuzzy feels we’d hope for in a TMNT movie. As with Barbie, the secret of reviving old IP is having a fresh and relevant vision that expands on the original promise of the material; TMNT: MM has all that in plentiful quality. Even if they don’t have nipples, or last names, these guys are easily the best big-screen version of the Turtles we’ve seen to date; with Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne and other talent properly engaged, it’s one of 2023’s most surprising successes. It’s also a kids/family film that’s smarter than most films for adults, and should cross-over to audiences of all ages; in the immortal words of Y Kid K, get ready to spin that wheel, because these heroic turtles just got real. Awesome!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmlsbS1hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTkvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-02 14:37:43+00:00,“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” – 15 Horror Icons Who Appeared in Nickelodeon’s 2012 Animated Series,"Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series is loaded with love for the horror genre, and it's packed with horror icons.","While much of the initial fanbase that helped turn Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into a pop culture phenomenon aged out following the original cartoon (1987-1996) and live action movies (1990-1993), the property has continued to flourish with reboots in TV, film, and comics every few years.

If the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has you interested in exploring various versions of TMNT, there’s no better place for a horror fan to start than Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series that aired for five seasons between 2012 and 2017.

While there’s an inherent connection to horror in the various mutants and monsters that pop up throughout the franchise, no rendition embraces the genre nearly as much as this one. In addition to references to classics like Alien, Friday the 13th, and The Evil Dead, the series employed several notable horror actors throughout its 124-episode run.

Here are 15 horror icons who lent their voices to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2012.

1. Corey Feldman – Slash

Corey Feldman may not be synonymous with horror, but the pedigree of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, The Lost Boys, and Gremlins is more than enough to make him an icon of the genre. His TMNT legacy is even stronger, having voiced Donatello in the first and third live action films.

In animated form, Feldman play Slash, who was a villain in the original series but an ally in this version. He starts out as Raphael’s pet tortoise, Spike, before being accidentally mutated. He’s introduced in Season 2’s “Slash and Destroy” and appears in total of 12 episodes, culminating with the series finale, “The Big Blow Out.”

2. Kelly Hu – Karai

Feldman’s not the only Friday the 13th franchise alumnus on the show. Kelly Hu’s resume includes The Scorpion King, X2: X-Men United, and Arrow, but horror fans will recall her film debut as Eva in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan.

Hu plays the integral TMNT role of Karai, a character that debuted in the comics in 1992 and previously appeared in the 2003 animated series. She’s in 31 episodes of TMNT 2012, from season 1’s “New Girl in Town” to season 5’s “The Foot Walks Again.”

In this incarnation, Karai starts out as a fierce, teenage Foot Clan member that was raised by the evil Shredder. She later aligns herself with the Turtles upon the revelation that she’s actually Master Splinter’s biological daughter from before he was mutated. In season 3, she’s exposed to a mutagen that gives her serpent-like abilities.

3. Cassandra Peterson – Ms. Campbell

Cassandra Peterson — beloved by all as horror host Elvira — is usually vivacious, but her part on TMNT required a more monotonous performance. She voices Ms. Campbell/Utrom Queen in six episodes, from season 1’s “The Alien Agenda” to season 5’s “When Worlds Collide.”

Ms. Campbell is introduced as a woman who takes an interest in April O’Neil before it’s revealed that she’s an evil robot sent by the evil Krang, armed with laser eyes and missile arms. When her human disguise is damaged in season 4’s “The War for Dimension X,” the Utom Queen’s true form is revealed.

4. Keith David – Sal Commander

Keith David achieved cult status for his roles in The Thing (which, incidentally, inspired TMNT’s season 3 episode “Burned Secrets”) and They Live, but his rich pipes have also earned him Emmy awards. His extensive voice work includes Gargoyles, Coraline, The Princess and the Frog, Spawn, and Rick and Morty.

On TMNT, he voices Sal Commander (also known as G’Throkka) for five episodes, from season 4’s “The Moons of Thalos 3” to season 5’s “When Worlds Collide Part 2.” An ally to the Turtles, Sal is the commander of the Salamandrians, an extraterrestrial species that resembles large, humanoid salamanders.

5. Jeffrey Combs – Rat King

Rat King is a villain that originated in the comics and appeared in both the 1987 and 2003 animated series. Re-Animator star Jeffrey Combs lends his voice to the character for four episodes of the 2012 rendition.

He debuts as Dr. Victor Falcon in season 1’s “Monkey Brains” and returns in “I, Monster,” in which his experiments yield him the ability to control rats, hence the Rat King moniker. Splinter defeats him and his army of giant rats in season 2’s “Of Rats and Men.” His final appearance is in season 4’s “Darkest Plight” as a hallucination to Splinter.

6. Ron Perlman – Armaggon

Ron Perlman has played and/or appeared alongside various creatures in the likes of Hellboy, Blade II, Alien: Resurrection, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and Sleepwalkers. For three episodes in TMNT’s fourth season, he voiced the villainous Armaggon, an alien cyborg shark.

Armaggon debuts in “The Outlaw Armaggon” as a bounty hunter hired by crime lord Vringath Dregg (voiced by Peter Stormare) to capture the Turtles. He makes his final appearance in “The Evil of Dregg,” in which he’s defeated for good.

7. Chris Sarandon – Dracula

Over three decades after starring as Jerry Dandrige in Fright Night, Chris Sarandon returned to his vampiric roots to portray the ultimate blood sucker: Count Dracula. He plays an integral role in season 5’s four-part Monster & Mutants arc, first appearing (albeit without dialogue) in “The Curse of Savanti Romero.”

Dracula is one of the creatures recruited by time-traveling sorcerer Savanti Romero to take over the world, along with Frankenstein’s Monster, Vulko the werewolf, and The Pharaoh mummy. Dracula plans to betray Savanti, but Michelangelo destroys him before he has the chance.

8. Dana DeLorenzo – Esmeralda

No stranger to being surrounded by monsters after three seasons of Ash vs Evil Dead, Dana DeLorenzo can be heard alongside Sarandon in “The Crypt of Dracula.” She plays Esmeralda, the daughter of Vulko the werewolf. The Romanian traveler shares her knowledge of monsters with the Turtles.

DeLorenzo’s Ash vs Evil Dead co-star Lucy Lawless voices Daagon supreme ruler Hiidrala in season 4’s “The Cosmic Ocean.”

9. Danny Trejo – Newtralizer

Machete don’t text, but he does voices. Genre favorite Danny Trejo plays Newtralizer (also known as K’Vathrak), a Salamandrian bounty hunter who will stop at nothing to eradicate the Kraang — even if that means taking out innocent humans and the Turtles.

The character first appears in Season 1’s “Operation: Break Out,” in which he breaks out of his cell and Donnie gives him his nickname. Trejo came in to play him in season 2’s “Newtralized,” briefly teaming up with Feldman’s Slash in an episode loaded with Star Wars references, and later returning in season 5’s two-part “When Worlds Collide,” where he has the newfound ability to wield electricity.

10. James Hong – Ho Chan

James Hong has over 600 credits — from Blade Runner to Seinfeld to Kung Fu Panda to Everything Everywhere All at Once — but horror fans will always associate him with Lo Pan from Big Trouble in Little China. He plays a similar role in TMNT’s Big Trouble homage, “A Chinatown Ghost Story,” in Season 2.

Hong voices the villainous Ho Chan, an ancient ghost sorcerer who even borrows a line from ol’ Jack Burton, “It’s all in the reflexes.” While the Turtles ultimately defeat him, he vows to return at the end of the episode. He does so in season 5’s “End Times,” but this time around Splinter ensures it’s the last of him.

11. Robert Englund – Dire Beaver / Dread Beaver

Robert Englund is, of course, best known for his work in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. When TMNT drew inspiration from the horror classic for season 5’s “In Dreams,” they called on Freddy Krueger himself to provide a voice.

Englund voices Dire Beaver and Dread Beaver, two of the four interdimensional Dream Beavers that trap the Turtles in their dreams. The episode features several nods to Freddy, including the beavers’ long claws, a musical cue reminiscent of the Elm Street theme, and a nightmare involving a furnace.

12. John Kassir – Dark Beaver / Dave Beaver

Along with Englund in “In Dreams,” the other two Dream Beavers — Dark Beaver and Dave Beaver — are played by John Kassir. He has over 250 credits to his name, the majority of which are voice roles, but his unmistakable pipes are best known for Tales from the Crypt‘s ghoulish host, the Crypt Keeper.

13. Bill Moseley – Bernie

Would you believe there’s a third horror icon in “In Dreams?” Bill Moseley — known for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2, House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil’s Rejects, and Night of the Living Dead — plays Bernie in the same episode.

A physicist-turned-grocer, Bernie has stayed awake for decades to prevent the Dream Beavers from attacking our world. His weapon of choice is a chainsaw with “The Saw is Family” engraved on the blade, in reference to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III.

The character later makes a photo cameo later in season 3 in “Dinosaur Seen in Sewers,” where he’s featured on a tabloid with the headline “Man did not sleep for 40 years.”

14. Lance Henriksen – Zog



With credits including The Terminator, Aliens, Near Dark, Scream 3, and Pumpkinhead, Lance Henriksen is an undisputed genre legend. He lends his talents to TMNT as Zog, a character that was originally created for the comics and previously appeared in the 2003 animated series.

Zog appears in season 3’s “Dinosaur Seen in Sewers” as a scout who plans to signal his fellow Triceratons to attack the Earth in order to destroy the Kraang – until the Turtles get involved, that is. He refuses Raphael’s attempt to save his life, instead opting to plummet to his death.

15. Michael Ironside – Emperor Zanmoran

Michael Ironside brings a signature gravitas to all of his projects, from Total Recall, Starship Troopers, and Scanners to Terminator Salvation, Turbo Kid, and TMNT, in which he plays Emperor Zanmoran.

Although he only appears in one episode – Season 4’s “The Arena of Carnage” – Zanmoran is a pivotal foe whose presence can be felt throughout the season’s space arc. Zanmoran serves as the sadistic leader of the Triceraton Empire and commander of their armada.

Some of the many other recognizable voices that pop up throughout the series include Sean Astin as Raphael, Seth Green as Leonardo, Clancy Brown as Rahzar, David Tennant as The Fugitoid, Mark Hamill as Kavaxas, Jesse Ventura as The Finger, Paul Reubens as Sir Malachi, and TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman as Ice Cream Kitty.

Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Series is available on DVD. Select seasons are streaming Netflix and Paramount+.

,What To Know Before Taking Your Kids To See The New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie,"The new Seth Rogan take on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is perfect for your tween, but maybe not for your toddler.","The ‘90s are back, and so are the Ninja Turtles. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opened Aug. 2, and if you’re a turtle-loving child of the ‘90s like me, once you’ve recovered from your Barbie-mania, you might ride that theater-going wave right back into TMNT. With gorgeous animation, a star-studded cast (Ice Cube and Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolf?!) and a fantastic soundtrack, it’s a can’t-miss summer movie. But can you bring the kids? You’re eager to share your love for Donatello, Raphael, Michaelangelo, and Leonardo, but we all know what a buzzkill it is when family movie night turns into an accidental nightmare factory. Here’s what parents need to know before buying tickets to the new Ninja Turtles movie.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is rated PG.

And it earns that rating. There is really no language to speak of — I think the ‘worst’ phrase is maybe “shut up” — but there is a lot of fighting (they are Ninja Turtles, after all) and a few fairly scary villains. Our kids are 5 and 2, so my husband and I snuck away to catch this movie ourselves mid-day. There were some small kids in the theater, and I heard a lot of whispered questions and a few whimpers during some more intense scenes. It felt like confirmation that this movie probably isn’t going to be enjoyed by kids younger than 7 or 8, and we were glad our 5-year-old was at home. Jokes will go over little kids’ heads — but you’ll be laughing pretty hard (thanks Seth!) — and some of the more violent moments might raise questions that you don’t really feel like answering (like is that guy really dead?) during what’s supposed to be a fun time at the movies. Common Sense Media also agrees that this movie is best suited for kids 8 and up.

If your kids are under 7 or 8, maybe get a sitter and make it a date night.

Between a scene where the turtles are “milked” by a villain — it’s laced with humor, but a little kid might be freaked out and their parents would hear about it at bedtime — and more than one epic fight that involve seeing the Ninja Turtles kill their antagonists, this movie really isn’t for the littlest kids.

However, the jokes are rock solid enough to be date-night worthy if you have little kids and can get a sitter. Or, if your kids are older — at least 7+ — the movie would be so much fun for a parent to see with their big kid, tween or early teen either in theaters now, or when it becomes available to stream on Paramount+.

Writers Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg really lean into the “teenage” element of the Ninja Turtles’ story in this film in a way that feels really fresh and sweet. With warmth, plenty of humor, and a killer Trent Reznor-meets-‘90s-hop-hop soundtrack, they explore themes that will resonate with kids and families who are working through the growing pains that can come with the tween and teen years.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbXBlci5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWFwcHJvcHJpYXRlLWFnZS1yYXRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

From creators Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi, Reservation Dogs follows the exploits of Elora Danan (Devery Jacobs), Bear Smallhill (D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), Willie Jack (Paulina Alexis) and Cheese (Lane Factor), four Indigenous teenagers in rural Oklahoma.

In season 2, after the death of Daniel, the fifth member of the Reservation Dogs, the crew took to stealing, scheming and saving in order to fulfill his dream of getting to California. The plan took a detour when the gang disbanded, leaving everyone to forge their own paths. Elora took off with the Rez Dogs’ mortal enemy, Jackie (Elva Guerra), Bear received ancient wisdom from Spirit (Dallas Goldtooth) in the most sacred of porta potties, Willie Jack discovered her ancestry in a prison visiting room and Cheese spent time in a boys’ home, while never forgetting his pronouns. Realizing they were stronger together, the Rez Dogs reunited and made it to Cali, where, with feet in the sand and waves crashing in front of them, they said goodbye to Daniel.

This season, the Rez Dogs find themselves stranded in Cali and have to figure out their way back home. After making it back to Okern, Elora considers the idea of college, Bear comes across a conspiracy theorist named Maximus (Graham Greene), Willie Jack grows more invested in healing her community and Cheese, well, he still lives with his grandmother who’s not his grandmother. Meanwhile, the aunties, uncles and elders explore their pasts and try to heal old wounds.

Cast also includes tribal cop Big (Zahn McClarnon); cannabis-loving Brownie (Gary Farmer); physics-obsessed Bucky (Wes Studi); the enigmatic Deer Lady (Kaniehtiio Horn); Bear’s mom Rita (Sarah Podemski) and her cousin Teenie (Tamara Podemski); Willie Jack’s dad Leon (Jon Proudstar); Daniel’s mom Hokti (Lily Gladstone); medicine man Old Man Fixico (Richard Ray Whitman); junkyard prophet Kenny Boy (Kirk Fox); gum-smacking Bev (Jana Schmieding); and ride-less rap duo Mose (Lil Mike) and Mekko (FunnyBone).

Praised as a breakthrough in Indigenous representation on television, in its first two seasons Reservation Dogs landed on 180+ critics’ year-end best lists, was honored as an AFI Television Program of the Year for two consecutive years and won two Independent Spirit Awards, a Gotham Award and Peabody Award. The show was among seven programs recognized in 2022 by the Television Academy as part of its Television Academy Honors, showcasing exceptional programs and their producers who have leveraged the power of television to fuel social change.

Executive producers include Harjo, Waititi, and Garrett Basch. Reservation Dogs is produced by FX Productions.

Season 3 of Reservation Dogs premieres August 2 at FX on Hulu.

2023-07-27 09:46:05+00:00,"Movies to watch in August, from 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' to 'Blue Beetle'","A new month will bring a new crop of movies, from a video game adaptation to a pair of raunchy comedies.","To those who finally returned to theaters for the first time in forever thanks to ""Barbenheimer,"" welcome back! Movies are pretty cool, huh? Unfortunately, the summer movie season has likely peaked with the dual release of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" But there are still plenty of intriguing new releases in August, from a reboot of a beloved '80s property to a pair of raunchy comedies that could make for your next great double feature.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (Aug. 2)

Cowabunga! The ninja turtles are back for their first animated movie in more than 15 years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" following two live-action Michael Bay films. ""After years of being sheltered from the human world,"" the turtles set out to ""win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,"" per Paramount. Seth Rogen worked on the screenplay and voices Bebop, and the rest of the voice cast includes John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The turtles also have a new look, as the film's art style is reminiscent of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" With great turtle power comes great turtle responsibility.

""Meg 2: The Trench"" (Aug. 4)

What better way to close out the summer than with a big, dumb shark movie? Jason Statham returns in this sequel to ""The Meg,"" the 2018 surprise hit that saw him gloriously face off against a megalodon shark. This time, he and Wu Jing ""lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean,"" which ""spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival,"" per Warner Bros. It's based on the follow-up to the original novel, and the screenwriters from the first movie are back, though there's a new director: Ben Wheatley, the filmmaker known for disturbing horror movies like ""Kill List."" Hopefully, the sequel hasn't bitten off more than it can chew.

""Shortcomings"" (Aug. 4)

Randall Park has long been a delightful on-screen presence, but he's now ready to get behind the camera. Variety described Park's new dramedy ""Shortcomings"" as a ""fresh-faced, funny directorial debut"" for the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" star. From Sony Pictures Classics, the movie follows a struggling filmmaker, Ben (Justin H. Min), and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), who works for an Asian American film festival. ""When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want,"" the synopsis says. Sherry Cola stars as Ben's best friend Alice. Sony also described Ben as a man who ""spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women"" and ""watching Criterion Collection DVDs."" Wait, is this play about us?

""Heart of Stone"" (Aug. 11)

Gal Gadot's future as Wonder Woman may be in doubt, but if that gig falls through, at least she's got a home in the Netflix ecosystem. After starring in the streamer's ""Red Notice,"" Gadot returns for another Netflix original film that she also produced, the spy thriller ""Heart of Stone,"" in which she plays secret agent Rachel Stone. She's the ""only intelligence operative who stands between her global, peace-keeping organization and the loss of its most valuable — and dangerous — asset, codenamed: The Heart,"" per Netflix. Jamie Dornan also stars. Director Tom Harper told Entertainment Weekly the aim is for the film to spawn a new female-led action series like James Bond. In its attempt to craft more original franchises, Netflix is leaving no stone unturned.

""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" (Aug. 11)

If ""Renfield"" got you in the mood for more Dracula on the big screen, Universal has another movie for you. From ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" director André Øvredal, ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is based on a chapter from the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" novel, ""The Captain's Log,"" in which Dracula travels on board a merchant ship and things don't end well for those aboard. ""Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship,"" per Universal. Think of it as ""Alien,"" but on a boat and with Dracula instead of a Xenomorph. Corey Hawkins and Liam Cunningham star, and Javier Botet plays Dracula. With their help, for now, the Universal monsters franchise is alive.

""Gran Turismo"" (Aug. 11)

The race to find the next great video game movie is shifting gears with ""Gran Turismo."" David Harbour and Orlando Bloom star in this film based on the popular racing video games, though it's not a direct adaptation of them. Instead, it's inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, who became an actual race car driver after playing the video game competitively. The stakes are high for director Neill Blomkamp, who has struggled to follow up his critically-acclaimed debut film, 2009's ""District 9;"" his last two movies, ""Chappie"" and ""Demonic,"" were both widely panned. Can bringing a racing game to the big screen get his career back on track?

""Blue Beetle"" (Aug. 18)

The end of the DC universe as we know it is in sight, but it's not quite over yet. The DC Extended Universe still has two more films left before new boss James Gunn reboots the franchise. First up is ""Blue Beetle,"" in which a young college graduate, played by Xolo Maridueña, ""unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,"" which ""chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host,"" leading him to become the superhero Blue Beetle, per Warner Bros. Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first character of the new DC universe, suggesting he could stick around even after the upcoming reboot. But that likely depends on how well this film performs, as if it's another DC bomb, expect the character to be tossed aside as quickly as Ezra Miller's Flash.

""Strays"" (Aug. 18)

In June, Jennifer Lawrence did her part to keep comedies alive in theaters with ""No Hard Feelings,"" and ""Strays"" is now picking up the torch. This new comedy produced by ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller has a unique hook: it's a filthy, R-rated film starring a bunch of talking dogs. The pups ""hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie,"" a Border Terrier voiced by Will Ferrell, ""find his way home"" and make his ""lowlife owner"" pay for abandoning him. Jamie Foxx and Will Forte also flesh out the voice cast, and Dennis Quaid appears in the movie as himself. Will this barking dog comedy have bite?

""Bottoms"" (Aug. 25)

Two of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood today are Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri, but fans introduced to them though ""Shiva Baby"" and ""The Bear"" may not realize the two collaborated in 2020 on the digital shorts ""Ayo and Rachel Are Single."" Three years later, they're teaming back up for the raunchy sex comedy ""Bottoms,"" in which two girls ""start a fight club as a way to lose their virginities to cheerleaders,"" per MGM. Emma Seligman directed the film in her follow-up to ""Shiva Baby,"" and Sennott co-wrote it with Seligman. Marshawn Lynch also stars. The movie earned near universal acclaim at South by Southwest, with Mashable's Kristy Puchko calling it a ""ruthless and hysterical parody of the teen sex comedy."" This is one fight club everyone will be talking about.

""Retribution"" (Aug. 25)

We've got five words for you: ""Speed,"" but with Liam Neeson. If you're not already on board, you should be. The actor leads this new action-thriller in which a man receives a call from a mysterious person who tells him there's a bomb under his car seat. The caller demands he ""complete a specific series of tasks,"" and with ""his kids trapped in the back seat and a bomb that will explode if they get out of the car, a normal commute becomes a twisted game of life or death,"" per Lionsgate. Nimród Antal, the filmmaker behind 2010's ""Predators,"" directs, and Jack Champion and Matthew Modine also star. Following new blockbusters starring Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, it's the perfect conclusion to the summer of aging action stars proving they've still got it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzEwMjUyNDcvbmV3LW1vdmllcy1yZWxlYXNpbmctYXVndXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-03 18:44:08.091000+00:00,5 Ways Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Changes the Franchise,TMNT: Mutant Mayhem pushes this 40-year-old franchise in some unexpected directions. Here are the five biggest changes in the new movie.,"Warning: this article contains spoilers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Be sure to check out IGN's review of Mutant Mayhem.
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise has taken a number of forms over the decades, transforming first from a gritty indie comic to a family-friendly animated series to a relatively darker live-action movie. Many new takes on the franchise have followed over the years, and each makes some changes to the established formula. But rarely has a new TMNT project shaken things up as much as Mutant Mayhem.
From reimagined villains to a very different version of April O’Neil, let’s break down the biggest changes introduced in Mutant Mayhem.
TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Character Posters 16 Images
Splinter’s Origin Story
Splinter’s origin story tends to vary from one incarnation of the TMNT franchise to the next. In some cases, like the original Mirage comics and the 1990 movie, Splinter is depicted as the pet rat of Japanese martial artist Hamato Yoshi. In other versions, like the 1987 animated series and the contemporary IDW comics, Splinter is Hamato Yoshi himself. But either way, Splinter is a character inextricably linked to the mortal enemy of Shredder.
Mutant Mayhem doesn’t stick to that formula. As far as the movie would have us believe, this version of Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan) has no connection to Yoshi. He was never human, and he appears to have spent his life living as a common rat in the streets of New York before being exposed to the TCRI mutagen.
We learn Splinter became a master of the martial arts specifically because of his agoraphobia and mistrust of his fellow New Yorkers. He learned the skills necessary to defend himself and passed them on to his four sons. It’s always possible that Mutant Mayhem’s follow-ups will restore some of Splinter’s missing backstory, but as things stand right now, he’s a very different character in both background and temperament.
Shredder’s Absence
Not only is Splinter a very different character in Mutant Mayhem, but the movie also deviates from the usual path when it comes to Splinter’s arch-enemy Shredder. In this case, it diverges by barely mentioning Shredder at all. In most incarnations of the franchise, Shredder is the first major villain the Turtles go up against. His early crime sprees usually draw the Turtles out of the sewers and into conflict with the Foot Clan.
“ Even Shredder and Splinter’s respective origin stories are often closely intertwined.
Even Shredder and Splinter’s respective origin stories are often closely intertwined. For example, the 1990 movie established Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi as rivals and Splinter as the one who scarred Saki’s face. IDW’s comics have taken things several steps further, revealing Splinter and the Turtles to be reincarnated versions of humans killed by the Foot Clan many years before.
None of that appears to be influencing Mutant Mayhem’s take on Shredder, however. We only catch a brief glimpse of the villain during the film’s mid-credits scene, which sets him up to be the warrior Cynthia Utrom hires to track down and capture the Turtles. Does he have any connection to Splinter? Does the Foot Clan exist in this universe? We’ll have to wait for the spinoff series or sequel movie to find out.

April O’Neil: Teen Reporter
Another way Mutant Mayhem sets itself apart from previous animated incarnations of the TMNT is that it’s project which really leans into the idea of the Turtles being young, with all the angst and awkwardness that comes with that territory.
The same goes for Ayo Edebiri’s April O’Neil. who’s still a high schooler in the movie. That’s a big change from most versions of the franchise, where April is normally depicted as a young adult who works either as a news reporter or a lab technician.
April being a teenager winds up playing a major part in the film’s conflict. We learn the character is an aspiring journalist who struggles with being camera-shy. She’s dealt a major blow to her reputation when she vomits all over the set while trying to read the morning announcements. This version of April is young, hungry and looking to boost her credibility, which she accomplishes with a little help from her mutant friends.
The Other Mutants
Mutant Mayhem features a surprisingly large cast of TMNT mutants considering its relatively lean runtime. Everyone from Bebop and Rocksteady to Leatherhead to Mondo Gecko are featured in the film. Mutant Mayhem juggles this large cast by giving them all a shared origin. They’re all offshoots of Baxter Stockman’s (Giancarlo Esposito) research, created by Superfly (Ice Cube) to fill out the ranks of his mutant gang.
Not only does this serve to streamline their respective origin stories, this approach also alters the motivations of many of these characters. Bebop and Rocksteady are normally portrayed as villains in the TMNT franchise - musclebound brutes who serve as hired muscle to Shredder or Krang. But in Mutant Mayhem, they aren’t really villains, just misguided mutants going along with Superfly’s plan until they finally see the light. By the end of the film, all of these mutant characters are seen fighting alongside the Turtles against Superfly.
As for Superfly himself, he’s essentially a new character created for the film. Normally, Baxter Stockman transforms into a mutant human/fly hybrid, but here it’s instead his pet fly who’s exposed to the mutagen. Stockman himself only plays a small role in the film before being killed by Cynthia Utrom’s (Maya Rudolph) strike team.
In an interview with Collider, director Jeff Rowe revealed that Stockman was meant to become Superfly in an earlier version of the film, but plans shifted over time.

Coming Out of Their Shells
As we mentioned before, Mutant Mayhem is unique in that it really leans into the idea of the Turtles being actual teenagers. Even the voice actors for the four Turtles are teens themselves. That plays into one of the more interesting subplots in the movie - their desire to venture out into the world and attend high school.
Normally, the Turtles tend to stick to the shadows and do their best not to be seen by the human world. It makes sense. Ordinary people aren’t equipped to handle the prospect of mutant, humanoid turtles walking among them. In the live-action movies, Splinter would mete out punishment whenever the Turtles screwed up and got themselves noticed by innocent bystanders.
“ The Turtles wind up winning the hearts and minds of their city, proving that Splinter’s fear of the surface world was slightly overblown.
But by the climax of the film, the Turtles have abandoned all pretense of trying to stay hidden. When you’re chasing a gigantic killer fly monster through the streets of New York, why bother maintaining stealth? The Turtles wind up winning the hearts and minds of their city, proving that Splinter’s fear of the surface world was slightly overblown.
This all leads to what is easily the biggest change in the entire film. The mid-credits scene shows the Turtles achieving their dream and attending high school alongside April. They even go to prom. They’re now public figures in a city that has seemingly accepted the idea of walking, taking mutants. It should be interesting to see how this plot twist plays out in the upcoming streaming series.

2023-08-02 21:29:08+00:00,"Latest Mutant Ninja Turtle movie, ""Mutant Mayhem,"" falls short","Review: A confused ""Mutant Mayhem"" tries to give ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" the big-screen turn it deserves","The latest reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, fittingly known as “Mutant Mayhem,” leaps past the franchise’s otherwise dismal screen turns by bringing an animated flair and relative innocence to the sewers and rooftops of New York City.
But simply being better than past failures does not make something good. While “Mutant Mayhem” does several things right, from its likeable voice cast to its refreshed version of the Turtles’ origin story, it also gets stuck in the same gunk as its forebears. Directed by Jeff Rowe, “Mutant Mayhem” boasts a wild, eclectic animation style that draws heavily from the groundbreaking “Spider-Verse” films, with overlapping scribbles, thick outlines and expressive character design. That includes the lumpy, mostly grotesque human characters, who are almost universally presented as monsters.
That’s because our turtles — leader Leonardo, techie Donatello, bruiser Raphael and cut-up Michelangelo — are the true, sympathetic heroes of a story that draws subtle threads from “Phantom of the Opera” and “The Elephant Man.” The turtles were found crawling in green ooze by a similarly radioactive rat, who would mutate into their father and caretaker, the ninja master Splinter (voiced with gusto by Jackie Chan). They hide in the sewers, yearning to integrate into a society that Splinter says is afraid of them and will kill them at the first chance they get.
That’s more or less true, minus the scooter-riding April O’Neill, an aspiring documentarian. She’s particularly young and brash here — a pivot from the adult broadcast-news journalist or scientist she’s usually depicted as in TMNT films, TV series and the comics. She’s voiced by the ascendant and immensely likable Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear,” “Abbot Elementary”), who adds humanity to an already heartfelt film about trying to fit into a society that doesn’t want you because you’re different — and therefore a threat.
Cultural commentary aside, “Mutant Mayhem” goes kitchen-sink on familiar TMNT characters, most of them unwitting science-experiment victims of the mad baddie Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito). But instead of focusing on Shredder and Krang (the series’ alpha villains), our main foil is Superfly, a mutated housefly voiced by Ice Cube that wants to turn all insects into giant, powerful mutants. That’s obviously a bad idea and as our turtles learn of it, they also meet Superfly’s gallery of rogues, including the iconic Rocksteady and Bebop.
Those talking animals, most of which are uneasy with their sudden, human-like qualities, are all voiced by ringers: Paul Rudd (Mondo Gecko), Post Malone (Ray Fillet), Rose Byrne (Leatherhead), John Cena (Rocksteady) and producer/co-writer Seth Rogen (Bebop), to name just a few. New York City, naturally, is another character and plot device that provides different literal and figurative perspectives on Brooklyn, where much of it takes place.
And yet, for all its committed performances and charm, “Mutant Mayhem” is also tonally confused and eventually falls into the too-easy rhythms of action-oriented superhero fare. As noted, it’s better than the awkward (and regrettably live-action) ’90s film adaptations, and certainly comes off as “Citizen Kane” compared to Michael Bay’s unwatchable takes on the characters. Like Bay’s also-soulless “Transformers” adaptations and Zach Snyder’s murderous, nihilistic take on Superman and Batman, his TMNT movies were bad-faith revisionism less focused on reinterpreting the characters and more about projecting a toxic, hollow machismo.
“Mutant Mayhem” has a similarly militaristic, gun-fetishism opening that feels jarring for a PG movie, but that improves slightly as the movie unfurls. The humor, too feels uneven, ranging from adolescent quips to mean-spirited and overlong putdowns that confuse the message of tolerance. The plot is incidental and, at times, too meta for its own good.
But there are earnest intentions here, however mutated by convention, the not-so-fun demands of mass-market storytelling, and instantly dated pop-culture references. It’s the best TMNT movie so far — but sadly, that’s not saying much.

2023-07-27 18:38:41.776000+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Review,"The animated film oozes confidence, energy, and heart, and the animated adventure represents a new high for the Turtles on the big screen.","The Spider-Verse movies cast a long web of shadows over Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Those vibrant Spidey adventures and the Turtles’ latest cinematic outing all represent modern reinventions of beloved superheroes that use the freedom of animation to express their stories in ways their live-action counterparts can't. Mutant Mayhem may be surfing onto the scene in Miles’ and Gwen’s wake, but the broad similarities fall out of focus quickly and, thanks to a punkier, more ground-level approach, Mutant Mayhem – from The Mitchells vs. The Machines co-director Jeff Rowe – is a vibrant, hilarious adventure from which the Heroes in a Half Shell can ( and will ) build a Turtleverse all their own.
Mutant Mayhem takes the broad strokes of Turtle lore largely for granted, opting for a streamlined introduction to Splinter (Jackie Chan) and his adopted sons: Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), and Donatello (Micah Abbey). From the start, the movie is far more interested in their relationship with Splinter as a father than as a master, with Splinter’s strong prejudice against humans forcing the Turtles to disobey him so they can be a part of the surface world like they’ve always dreamed. Mutant Mayhem makes the simple, yet seismic choice to do what comparatively few adaptations of Eastman and Laird’s comics have done before and lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the Mutant Ninja Turtles. There’s no going back: the infectious, talky banter the 15-year-old brothers generate amongst themselves and others is effortless and quotable, with an unpredictable dark streak that ensures laughs from all age groups.

Seemingly anticipating comparisons to other superhero stories, Mutant Mayhem opts to go with the flow and use that masks-and-capes landscape as the very context in which the Turtles hope to be seen. These are Turtles who know what’s going on in the MCU, and have learned (or been taught) that their abilities are the quickest way to win public approval. It’s that tension between what the Turtles want from the world, and what the world expects from them in return, that sees Mutant Mayhem’s storytelling at its most mature.
But most of the heavy lifting on that score goes to the world-weary Splinter. Jackie Chan’s portrayal of the rodent sensei is a constant source of warmth, with off-the-charts single-dad energy. A flashback covers the necessities of the family’s ooze-fuelled origin, but any of the mutation details therein are completely outshined by the effervescent moments of connection and growth among this sewer-dwelling family. That scene sets up Splinter’s reasonably justified distrust of humans, and the conflict it creates once the Turtles yearn to be where the people are a little more regularly.

The Turtles themselves all end up rallying around a desire to be accepted and loved by humans that doesn’t give them much room to disagree with each other, leaving them more interesting as a group than as individuals. Leonardo, predictably, gets a little more focus on his struggle to find confidence as team leader, but how and why he comes to identify with that responsibility isn’t tracked very closely through the story. That’s not to say that each Turtle doesn’t have a crystal-clear personality, largely in line with what you’d expect of each: Raph’s a rage-filled bruiser, Donnie’s super-smart, Mikey’s a goofball, Leo’s… the leader… but critically, Mutant Mayhem significantly tones down the cartoonish heights of their personalities. None of the Turtles ever feels like he’s trying to copy a version that’s come before – again, huge win there in casting actual teenagers in these roles.
Mutant Mayhem’s art style is perfectly suited to the crackling energy that drives the story forward. The bespoke characters interact with a comparatively realistic New York, and the relationship between the elasticity of the character animation and the more logic-based digital cinematography is a constant reminder of the ways the Turtles stick out in society. There’s a scribbled, rough quality that reveals finer and finer detail the closer you look, which evokes the movie's themes of prejudice and tolerance quite subtly. That inventiveness carries across to the action, where Rowe is not going for subtlety, and the Turtles move and strike with every use of their sai, katana, nunchaku, and bo staff accounted for. Mutant Mayhem’s killer visuals are pushed along by an absolute vibefest of a musical score, which I was totally enamored by and then later deeply unsurprised to learn came from the Oscar-winning Nine Inch Nails team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It’s a synth-dripping, flame-throwing grungescape that elevates the action and emotion at every turn.

The boundless energy and wonderfully drawn characters make up for a predictable plot, which itself feels like a bit of a mutated amalgamation of other superhero movies. It’s hard to begrudge Mutant Mayhem too much for that – it’s got as much right to celebrate its comics roots as any other superhero movie – but the notion that Everyday, Normal New Yorkers are the real heroes of these movies is losing its impact. And with how grounded the Turtles’ emotional throughline actually is, the world-ending stakes that mutant villain Superfly (Ice Cube) represents isn't as interesting as whether or not Splinter’s gonna let the kids go to the arcade more regularly by the end of the movie.
Superfly’s mutant henchanimals are the best character designs in the movie, with proportions and rough edges that make them feel like notebook sketches that have burst to life. The mutants are largely voiced by actors in co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s orbit: John Cena plays the Rocksteady to Rogen’s Bebop, while the earnest enthusiasm for life expressed by Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, and Hannibal Burress makes the genetic monstrosities they’re playing as endearing as the heroes. Special mention here goes to Byrne as Leatherhead – someone told her “sound more Australian than anyone has ever let you sound” and her performance is so Aussie, it'd make a toilet drain clockwise.
As is custom, the Turtles find an ally in intrepid reporter April O’Neil, and Ayo Edebiri’s self-effacing performance is another bright spot among Mutant Mayhem’s strong voice cast. After stumbling out of the gate with her budding school journalism career, April finds camaraderie with the outcast turtles and Edebiri’s deadpan reality checks keep the Turtles on track as their flights of heroic fancy start to take hold.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie review (2023),There are undeniably strong visuals here and enough creative voice work to make it tolerable on a hot August day when families are looking for an air-conditioned theater for a few hours.,"Yes, it’s another origin story. Despite being the seventh film to feature these characters, Rowe and co-writers Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg go back to the beginning of the TMNT saga, opening with a scientist named Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) creating the infamous ooze that turns ordinary creatures into mutants. When the authorities break into Baxter’s basement lair, the ooze is spilled into the sewers, and the rest is comic book history as a quartet of turtles becomes fast-talking humanoid creatures named Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Raphael (Brady Noon).
Fans of the franchise know that the turtles are nothing without their leader, Splinter (Jackie Chan), a rat who was also transformed by the ooze and became the father to the teenage mutants after teaching them the ninja skills to protect themselves. Splinter is extremely overprotective, ordering the boys to stay away from human beings at all costs or risk being milked by them (don't ask). A flashback reveals that Splinter tried to introduce himself and the turtles to the humans, but they were somewhat understandably terrified. Now they all live underground, as the turtles sneak out to get supplies and wish they could have a normal teenage life beyond the sewers.
Meanwhile, one of Baxter’s experiments responds very differently to the chasm between the human race and the mutants now living underground. Whereas Splinter wants to hide, Superfly (Ice Cube) wants something closer to vengeance. He’s assembled a group of mutants that include Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Rocksteady (John Cena), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Ray Fillet (Post Malone), Bebop (Seth Rogen), and Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd). Throw in Maya Rudolph as a mysterious figure trying to find the turtles and Ayo Edebiri as April, the human being who befriends the turtles and tries to introduce them to the above-ground world, and you have a stellar voice cast. Once Superfly and his cadre of creatures join the action, “Mutant Mayhem” gets exponentially more fun as each great actor is allowed fun voice beats to shine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 16:06:00+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Is Getting a Sequel and TV Show,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' is getting both a sequel and spinoff TV series. Here's everything we know about both projects so far.,"Every generation has its own slang, its own fashions, and its own take on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The recently released animated action comedy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem offers up a brand new origin story for Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown, Jr.) as they leave the shelter of the sewer home where they have been raised by Splinter (Jackie Chan). Once in the world above, they team up with teen reporter April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri) to defeat the mutant villain Superfly (Ice Cube), kick ass, and eat a whole lot of pizza.
Unlike the majority of previous iterations, Mutant Mayhem puts the emphasis on the ""teenage"" component of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, centering the awkwardness and vulnerability of the four brothers in the movie's narrative. And this creative decision, along with a star-studded voice cast and banger-filled soundtrack, is one of the reasons it's turning out to be one of the best-reviewed Turtles films in years.
""Through its perfectly imperfect animation style and a reimagining of the franchise’s world and characters, Mutant Mayhem is an exciting entry in a long-running series that makes it feel fresher than ever,"" wrote Daniel Chin at The Ringer, while Johnny Oleksinski at the New York Post called Mutant Mayhem the TMNT's ""finest hour (and a half).""
So, with all of this praise, and a mid-credit scene which teases the return of a famous villain, a sequel is all-but guaranteed, right?
Paramount
Will Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem get a sequel?
Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo will return: a sequel to Mutant Mayhem has officially been green-lit by Paramount Studios and will be directed once again by Jeff Rowe.
Not only that, but these new versions of the iconic characters will also appear in an animated TV series, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which has been commissioned for two seasons to ""bridge the gap"" between movies and will air on Paramount+.
Who will be in the cast?
Voice actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon are all expected to reprise their roles as the four brothers in the sequel as well as the spinoff show. It's unclear yet whether Jackie Chan will once again play Splinter, or if Ayo Edebiri (currently gaining acclaim for her role in The Bear) will return as April O'Neil.
When will TMNT 2 be released?
The sequel was in development when the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes began, so as of right now, there is no release date confirmed.

But, as you might expect for the band of half-shelled martial artists, there’s always another bad guy to fight and another crime to stop, and that means a sequel.
Mutant Mayhem gives us the origin story of the Turtles and has them face off against quite a few adversaries, but it’s also got a sequel tease that sets up the biggest bad guy the Turtles have ever had. Here’s everything we know so far about the follow ups to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, including the sequel and the animated show.
Is there going to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2?
Yes! The sequel to the new Turtles film, produced by Seth Rogen, was already greenlit before the first movie was even released.

The show is set to stream on Paramount Plus, and will run for two seasons.
When will Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2 come out?
This is a good question, and one that we don’t have an exact answer for. Given that the show is supposed to bridge the gap between the first movie and its sequel, we can probably say that that the second film is at least two years away. But who knows? It could be even more than that. It takes a long time to make animated films that look good!

Director Jeff Rowe said that while his crew initially thought about making Shredder the big bad of Mutant Mayhem, they felt like that wouldn’t give either the Turtles or their archrival the origin story they deserved — and the Turtles were obviously priority one. But that means that Shredder is coming up fast on the Turtles’ list of adversaries.
So is Shredder the villain of the TV show or the movie?
This is a tougher question. It could be that Shredder’s the villain of both — he’s certainly cool enough to be. Wherever he actually shows up, the good news (or bad news) is that we know Shredder is on the way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODExMzU4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS0yLXJlbGVhc2UtbmV3cy1jYXN0LXR2LXNob3ctc2hyZWRkZXLSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjM4MTEzNTgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLTItcmVsZWFzZS1uZXdzLWNhc3QtdHYtc2hvdy1zaHJlZGRlcg?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been a pretty consistent part of the pop culture landscape since Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s scrappy self-published comic became a sensation in the mid-1980s, spawning an iconic animated series and a popular toy line. In the years since, that initial spark of creativity has inspired several distinct animated universes, two live-action film series, a bevy of toys, multiple video games, mountains of comics, and at least one rock music tour.
With all of that in mind, we’re getting a brand new version of the plucky amphibian heroes in the form of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which looks to stoke the fires of 1980s nostalgia and introduce the Turtles to a new generation. If the previews released so far are anything to go by, the film appears to strike the right chords for older TMNT fans while also appealing to their children and – in some cases – grandchildren. Let’s head to the sewers and dredge up everything we know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

Starting afresh – as opposed to continuing one of the existing film or TV continuities – the film sees the Turtles, after years of seclusion and training, making their way to the surface in the hopes of being embraced by humanity. Befriending April O’Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), the team takes on a reclusive crime syndicate to keep the streets and sewers safe. And, maybe, they’ll find the acceptance they crave along the way.
Some fans may notice the absence of certain details – notably the Foot Clan and the ever-present Turtles nemesis Shredder – but the presence of characters like Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena) suggests those TMNT staples will appear in due course. See also: Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who often appears in Turtles stories as a press-ganged scientist aiding the Foot in the creation of their own mutants. Although, just as often, he willingly helps as it furthers his own aims and research in mutation.
And, as it happens, other mutants will quickly become a cause of concern for the Turtles. Will they be friends or foes? Considering the film is subtitled Mutant Mayhem, expect that question to drive some of the action.

Naturally enough, the Turtles inhabit New York. But judging from our first glimpses at the film, it is a stylized New York one might expect Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Miles Morales to visit. Indeed, the art direction was one of the big appeals for long-time fans when a teaser first arrived in March. Distinct from previous iterations of the Turtles, it also feels like a natural path for the comic book-inspired film.
Beyond that, the swift introduction of alien worlds (and aliens) in the original Eastman and Laird comics and the first animated series means there is always room for the Turtles to visit locations less grounded than Manhattan.

Eschewing the typical pattern for the Turtles voice cast – or even long-time voice actors like Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, or Greg Cipes – the film will feature four actual teenagers in the lead roles. The Walking Dead: World Beyond‘s Nicolas Cantu leads as Leonardo, the most dedicated of Master Splinter’s pupils to their training and goals. Micah Abbey lends his voice to generally tech-smart Donatello. Brady Noon of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers brings the attitude as a new Raphael, while Shamon Brown Jr. parties it up as Michelangelo.
Of course, we’re assuming the personalities of the Turtles will remain intact in Mutant Mayhem, but as seen in the teaser trailer, casting a group of young men leads to a noticeably different interpretation of the characters – vocally, at least. Additionally, the group recorded their dialogue together, offering a chance for more improvisation and a greater sense of camaraderie, which we clearly see in the scene of the Turtles goofing off in the teaser.
Beyond the four leads, the film is outfitted with a surprising number of familiar names – many of them playing surprising character pulls from Turtles history. Starting with the most recognizable characters, The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri lends her voice to this version of April O’Neil. The character has had many permutations over the years, from TV anchor to budding reporter to straight-up ninja, so anything is possible with Edebiri and her take on the Turtles’ most constant friend. Jackie Chan takes on the role of Master Splinter, the boys’ sensei and adoptive father.

As mentioned above, the recognizable bad guys include Bebop and Rocksteady, voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena, respectively, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman. Will the latter end up a fly by the end of the film? Time will tell.
Paul Rudd offers his talents as Mondo Gecko, the radical skateboarding lizard who has been part of TMNT lore since 1989. Rose Byrne plays Leatherhead, a mutant alligator who has been both friend and foe to the Turtles over the years. Post Malone voices Ray Fillet, a character who first appeared in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series as “Man-Ray” but soon made his way to the action figure aisles under his subsequent moniker. Hannibal Buress becomes Genghis Frog, one of the original toy line’s attempts at beating imitators to the punch with a group known as the Punk Frogs. Natasia Demetriou takes on Wingnut, a humanoid bat who is sometimes an alien, a mutant, a would-be superhero, or a terrorist, depending on the era and series. Maya Rudolph is Cynthia Utrom – a character who might seem new for the film, but with a last name that fans will certainly recognize and that suggests something very specific about who she might truly be.

And finally, Ice Cube is Superfly, a new addition to the group of mutants to be featured in the film, who is revealed to be the primary villain in the latest trailer. Taking a page out of X-Men nemesis Magneto’s playbook, Superfly asserts that humans will never accept mutants like him and his cohorts, so he’s out to conquer mankind and put mutants in charge. Bebop, Rocksteady, and the others accordingly appear to be on his side.
While all the other mutants certainly pull at the nostalgia strings, the new direction in casting the Turtles voices may be the key thing that opens the characters up to a new generation of fans.

The film is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs The Machines – which he also wrote – and a staff writer on Gravity Falls and Disenchantment. Joining him as co-director is Kyler Spears, who also worked on Mitchells as a storyboard artist; considering their past collaboration, it’s no surprise that Mutant Mayhem feels like the next step in the evolution of the visual style we saw in Mitchells. Rowe also wrote Mutant Mayhem in conjunction with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit.
According to Rogen, part of the intent is to lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the title more heavily than in past iterations, citing movies like Stand By Me as inspiration. Based on the teaser, it definitely appears his intent made it to the finished product.
Rogen and Goldberg serve as producers with Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean as executive producers. Other crew include procution designer Yashar Kassai, character designer James A. Castillo, production supervisor Derek Manzella, and post-production supervisor Ryan Price.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opens on August 2, 2023. It’s unclear if the intent is to launch a new wave of TMNT movies, but if the film is a success, it’s likely that fans will have plenty more to be excited for in the future of the franchise.

2023-07-24 16:30:00+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Director on What Jackie Chan Adds to Splinter,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe breaks down what Jackie Chan brings to Splinter and how this take is really leaning into him as a father figure.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has a pretty stacked cast: John Cena as Rocksteady, Ice Cube as Superfly, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote) as Bebop, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Rose Bryne as Leatherhead, Post Malone as Ray Fillet and, well, the list goes on.
But the biggest star of all? That probably has to go to Jackie Chan as Splinter, the Turtles’ mentor and father figure. And director Jeff Rowe was just as surprised as anyone that they were able to get him, he told IGN in an interview during our San Diego Comic-Con live show.
“We wanted him to do this and we had no idea,” he said. “We were like, ‘he’ll never say yes to this but let’s try it.’ But he was in. He was familiar with the franchise.”
When asked what Chan adds to Splinter, Rowe said he adds “humanity” and “a lot of warmth” to everyone’s favorite mutant rat.
“ ""Splinter’s got some crazy notions about humans, and he’s also pretty strict with the kids.
“We needed Splinter to be this loving dad character and Splinter’s got some crazy notions about humans, and he’s also pretty strict with the kids,” he went on. “And you need someone who’s just so likable and loveable that even when Splinter’s being hard, the audience doesn’t turn on him. You still like him and love him.”
And while Splinter has always acted as a paternal figure to the teenagers, Mutant Mayhem has really leaned into this. As IGN’s Brian Altano points out during the interview, the turtles even say “sorry, Dad” in one of the early trailers.
“It felt important to really make them a family and explore that style of family, where it’s single dad, four kids,” Rowe said. “He’s trying his best and it’s really hard because he did not expect to become a father.”

2023-07-16 16:10:00+00:00,Why ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Got a Makeover With Brand New CG Animation Style,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ offers a new look at the iconic turtle heroes thanks to CG animation.,"We’ve never been really far away from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Since they first arrived as comic book characters in the early 1980s, there has been a steady supply of comics, TV shows, games and films that celebrate the canon of Cowabunga. And TMNT fandom, once experienced, can almost never be forgotten. Is it the masks? The pizza? The ooze that made them who they are? It’s nearly impossible to single one thing out.
When lifelong Turtle enthusiasts Seth Rogen, Jeff Rowe and Evan Goldberg started working on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which arrives in theaters this August, they knew they wanted to update the characters for a new generation while also telling a relevant story. They were also interested in using a CG animation style that looked less than perfect and would remind audiences of their own doodles they might have done in a notebook while listening to a boring class lecture in high school.
“I think for us, artistically, it was a reaction to a 30-year trend in 3D CG animation to push towards photorealism and hyper-realistic lighting and texturing,” says writer-director Rowe, who also co-directed “The Mitchells vs. the Machines.” “Then, a few years ago, ‘(Spider-Man:) Into the Spider-Verse’ happened, and that showed that a movie can look like the concept artwork and can be critically and financially successful. That opened a lot of doors and I think we tried to take that football and run with it on ‘Mitchells,’ and then on ‘Turtles,’ I tried to be even less compromising. We decided we wanted this movie to look exactly like a concept artwork, and we want the concept artwork to feel distinctly human and not computer-generated. And that means sketchy and imperfect and misshapen and reminiscent of the way you draw when you’re a child or a teenager, and your passion and enthusiasm for making art hasn’t been dimmed by formal art training. It’s the kind of drawing you do before you have that voice in your head that says, ‘Don’t do that. That’s not how you draw.’ We wanted to design a film that had that level of unfettered expression. And then it was just a lot of designing it and convincing a lot of really talented artists that it was OK to make mistakes, and that those were actually features not bugs.”
Production designer Yashar Kassai found working out the sketchy, unfinished style one of the most difficult parts of the production as well.
“The thing that felt so wrong in the beginning was telling my very highly trained, skillful artists who are also ultra-talented that, because we’re drawing like teenagers, I need you to draw that again but I need you to peel away all those years you spent in art school learning your craft and draw like your 15-year-old self,” says Kassai. “But once everyone relinquished the conventional design wisdom of animation, we had a lot of fun.”
This emotionally authentic style of animation fell in line with the story they wanted to tell with TMNT — a coming-of-age origin story about teenagers who experience feelings of isolation, loneliness and awkwardness as they try to find themselves. Plus, they’re mutants and turtles.
During Rowe’s first meetings Rogen and Goldberg, they talked about bringing tears to the eyes of viewers “when they leave this movie. “Being a teenager is inherently an emotional, confusing, lonely time in your life. There’s so much feeling in making these characters real teenagers and we committed to having them voiced by teenagers.”
The voice cast includes Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Micah Abbey as Donatello and Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo. In the non-teenager roles, an equally notable group of actors appear: Rogen voices a mutant animal named Bebop, Jackie Chan is Master Splinter, John Cena is Rocksteady, Ice Cube plays the villainous Superfly and Maya Rudolph is the mysterious Cynthia Utrom.
The over-21 cast also voices mutants. And those mutants are some of the most unusual and bizarre you might see in a mainstream animation feature.
“Our Holy Grail of the entire franchise has always been the late ’80s cartoon, the original series, and that really wacky toy line that came out during the early ’90s,” says Kassai. “We were looking back to the time when sophomoric gross-out humor was the comedic style of the day. So we started there, but then we added the teenage drawing aspect on top of it as a very strong top layer. We were also heavily inspired by films like ‘Chungking Express.’ The Turtles are hiding from humans so it all takes place at night, and these kids have to hide in the shadows because they want to be a part of human society but they feel kind of unsafe when they’re around humans because of what their dad has told them about humans. So they cannot be like on a sunlit beach or on a sunny day in, like, Central Park. We spent a lot of time diversifying what New York at nighttime looks like and giving it a variety of different color schemes.”
For Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation and Paramount Animation, it was important to find the right creative team to take on TMNT. This team would be working with one of the most beloved animation franchises and reaching out to a new generation of potential fans who may have not even been born when the first TV shows and films were created.
“I think it’s an animation masterpiece and just hilarious and Seth and his team are such a big part of that,” says Naito. “It’s a good example of creators coming in to reimagine something that they love. I remember coming back to Nickelodeon and talking about TMNT and we knew the team who worked on it had to be creators who loved TMNT.”
Brian Robbins, president and CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, “and I both thought about Seth Rogen, and when we called him about it he loved it, he grew up with the characters. From there, we brought in Jeff Rowe, who also grew up with the Turtles and it was his dream for him to come and work on Turtles and to work with Seth. I think that love is really seen on the screen.”
For Goldberg, the appeal started early and never waned. He hopes their take on the characters will be relatable through their real, universal struggles.
“They are mutants, they are ninjas, and they are awesome-looking,” says Goldberg. “Overall, though, it is a story about a father and his four brothers who are very different, argue and disagree, but they are a family who are always there for each other. They are doing what they can to make the world a better place and that is what we should be doing. No matter your race, religion, or what type of mutated human-animal hybrid you are, you should be there for your family and do what you can to make the world rad. In a way, we are all Turtles, metaphorically speaking.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZvY3VzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1hbmltYXRpb24tMTIzNTY2NjU0MS_SAWhodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9mb2N1cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tYW5pbWF0aW9uLTEyMzU2NjY1NDEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 19:59:00+00:00,How a call from Seth Rogen convinced Ice Cube to join Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,All it took was one sentence to get the actor/singer on board with the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles project.,"Editor’s note: All interviews for this story were conducted prior to the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
How much convincing did it take for Ice Cube to sign on to the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem project?
“One sentence,” Ice Cube said with a smile. “It was like Seth [Rogen] calling me, ‘Hey, Cube! I’m doing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, man. I’ve got a character for you.'”
That character is the movie’s big bad guy, Superfly. As you’d expect, Superfly is just that: a fly. He leads an army of mutants — featuring the voice talents of Paul Rudd, Post Malone, Hannibal Burress, John Cena and Rogen — that go head-to-head with everyone’s favorite heroes in a half shell.

Early returns from sneak previews over the weekend indicate that the movie is headed for success. As of August 1, Mutant Mayhem sits at 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with 74 reviews.
“It was a no brainer,” Ice Cube said. “I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It’s like being drafted on a winning championship team dynasty. You would be a fool to turn this down.”
From the jump, Ice Cube connected with Superfly, even if the drawing didn’t quite match up with what he had in mind. “I thought when [Seth Rogen] said Superfly, I thought it was pimp hat. I thought it was Cadillac, and then he sent me to picture, and I’m like, ‘Oh, damn, he is a super ugly fly.’ I knew I could make him cool and make him the kingpin that he is running New York and causing mayhem.”
Ice Cube is not new to acting, having starred in roles from Friday (1995) to Anaconda (1997) to 21 Jump Street (2014) and many in between. He’s also an old pro in the recording studio, including his work on N.W.A.’s Straight Outta Compton (1988), It Was a Good Day (1992) and You Can Do It (2007).
But acting in the studio? That’s a bit of a different beast. One that Ice Cube enjoyed immensely. “I just went in the booth, put on my cape like I usually do like. In hip hop you’re in there by yourself most of the time anyway,” Cube explained. “What was cool is he had us working together. So, I was working directly with the turtles. And you know, it made for better voiceovers and better interaction.”

2023-07-28 10:00:00-04:00,Seth Rogen did Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Marvel scares him,"Seth Rogen, producer behind The Boys, Invincible, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, plans to stay far away from the Marvel and DC universes.","What does this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie have in common with 2011’s oddball superhero flick The Green Hornet? A name: Seth Rogen.
And while that might not seem like a feather in Mutant Mayhem’s cap, all the other Seth Rogen-produced comic book adaptations between the two do: There’s Preacher, The Boys, and Invincible, with more seasons and spinoffs of the latter two on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem looks to follow that streak.
The four wisecracking, pizza-scarfing turtles have featured in cartoon shows, movies, and toys for so long that it’s easy for their comic book origins to be eclipsed. In 1983, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird assembled their lightly parodic comics series from bits of every blockbuster superhero comic of the time: the teenagers of New Mutants and New Teen Titans; the mutants of the X-Men; and above all, Frank Miller’s Daredevil, from which they borrowed ninjas and martial arts, an origin story involving weird chemicals, a mentor named after a piece of wood, and a faceless horde of bad guys named after a bodily extremity.
Their self-published comic was the kind of sales and licensing success that rocked an industry still stretching its muscles from decades of publishing consolidation. So it’s not merely that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are an evergreen brand — they’re also a shoo-in for Rogen, who has quietly made a second career of racking up hugely successful comic book adaptations not based on Warner Bros. or Disney properties.
Polygon sat down to chat with Rogen in anticipation of the film, which he co-wrote and executive-produced (and for which he recorded the voice of Bebop), and which features the work of director Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and a cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Giancarlo Esposito. Paramount has already announced development on a sequel and a Paramount Plus TV spinoff, making Mutant Mayhem the dawn of a new era of the ever-mutating franchise.
[Ed. note: This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike against the AMPTP went into effect.]
Polygon: My favorite way to talk about TMNT’s arc from comics to a transmedia franchise is to point out that it started with making puns about Daredevil. What do you think it is about this really unique comic about altered reptile karate kids that keeps capturing different generations’ hearts and minds?
Seth Rogen: Someone smart once said all the best ideas start as jokes. And I think that this firmly falls into that category. It started as a way for two comic book writers to make each other laugh, literally. They were they were doodling in their sketchbooks, trying to crack each other up, and that’s where the first images of this came from.
But, like great writers, they imbued it with something that is undeniably relatable and resonant, which is the teenage part. That word is what makes it go from being a silly thing that is disposable, to something that weirdly has resonated with people for 40 years. It’s because they’re teenagers, and they feel this desire to be a part of the normal world, and this desire to be understood, and that they’re fun and kind of reckless and immature. That is really the thing that has made them resonate for so long. To me, it’s the thing that I thought was also the most underexplored. But it started, literally, as a comic book, and then became a Saturday morning cartoon and became toys — a lot of toys.
And I loved the toys. The toys themselves honestly had so much creativity put into them, and so many weird details and artistic elements. Something me and Jeff [Rowe] always talk about is how the Mondo Gecko toy — his tail had a roller skate tied to it, suggesting that [laughs] it was too heavy for him to drag around and so he, like, thought to put a roller skate on it to roll it around behind him. Little things like that were so imaginative, and they really have stuck in my head for 35 years.
And then the movies! I skateboarded because of the Ninja Turtles, and I did karate — it really tapped into a lot of things that were really popular in the ’80s, and ’90s as well. I felt like I was constantly the recipient of their goals; everything they were trying to do was really landing on me.
You’re quietly one of the biggest producers of indie comics adaptations in Hollywood. Preacher, The Boys, Invincible, and going back to The Green Hornet. How do you define your taste in comics? What kind of comic is the comic that grips you so hard that you go, Yeah, I think I want to make this my job for a year?
Well, first of all, it’s everything that is not Marvel and DC. [laughs] So that eliminates a lot right away. I grew up going to comic book shops, and it’s funny, video stores are making a slight comeback in some ways. This idea of browsing and not having things fed to you — as I think people feel we are now when it comes to entertainment — but instead entering the fair market of entertainment and just wandering around and seeing what catches your eye.
That’s what I always did with comic books; I would go to the comic book shop and I would just walk around. And you see this comic book and it catches your eye, and you see that comic book and it catches your eye. Those have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?
Like, I love Akira — what am I going to add to Akira? Things like that, where it’s out, and it’s good, it’s a movie and it exists. That’s something we think of also. For [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem], honestly [co-writer Evan Goldberg and I] felt like there was an unexplored facet, and as people who have written a lot of teenage films and have been cinematically linked to that genre a lot over the years, we were like, Oh, like, that’s totally different for this, is if we do a teenage version of it. A lot of it is just thinking, Could we bring this to life well and do it in a way that, as fans of it, we wouldn’t be annoyed with ourselves if we were watching it from the outside?
What has turned you off from Marvel and DC?
Honestly, probably fear. [laughs] We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.
It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with? And what’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this. So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!
Working on those bigger-budget, bigger-scope projects can be a real beast, and so can animated films. Are there specific lessons that you took from them for Mutant Mayhem?
I approach them very similarly. That’s something that I realized I used to think was a bug, and now I think it’s a feature. [laughs] A lot of people who make animated movies really approach them like animated movies, and they are constantly, from a writing standpoint, thinking of how to use the medium of animation, in the cutting pattern, in the scene patterns and all that. I’m firmly from the live-action world and so I very much write in the style of a live-action movie.
To me, I’m trying to bring what I would consider a traditional cinematic sensibility to the structure and the flow and how the scenes are, and not play too much into the medium in that way. And then to give the whole thing a look that is just, like, insane, was really a fun way to shade the whole thing.
It was unexpected to me, and I was honestly a little worried at what a big swing the look was at first. But the more I saw of it, I just started to get more and more excited about, and then started writing towards it, and thinking, OK, we have this crazy look. What do I want to see executed in this look? [laughs] What would be fun to watch?
Do you have comics on your bucket list for adaptation? Or, alternatively, what comics are you reading these days that you can’t put down?
That’s a good question. What have I been reading? I read old comics, from time to time. There’s these Green Lantern comics I’ve been reading, I love all those Grant Morrison Superman ones, I was rereading those because I heard that that’s what the James Gunn Superman movie was gonna be inspired by. I read them when they first came out, but I feel like I was distracted, so I went back.
Are there any that I wish we could make or adapt? Every once in a while? Yeah, those Grant Morrison ones are really appealing. We3 is something I’m a big fan of. It seems maybe just too sad honestly; it just bummed me out.
[Ed. note: We3 is a comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely about a trio of weaponized cyborg-animal hybrids. It’s infamous for its extreme violence and extreme pathos.]
We’ve kind of been down that road — and we know Grant a little bit, we’ve talked to him. That’s what’s nice, is we’ve done well with things that were traditionally considered unmakeable, essentially, for a long time. But also we don’t want to ruin things we love. So we’ll have very honest conversations with Grant and just talk about it and where his head’s at, and where our heads are at. Things like We3, we’ve talked to him about several times over the years. And we’re kind of always like, Yeah, I just don’t think this is the thing right now. There’s things like that — we really talk to the creators to make sure that we all think it’s a good idea, at that moment, in that way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODA4NjMxL3NldGgtcm9nZW4tdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy10aGUtYm95cy1pbnZpbmNpYmxlLWludGVydmlld9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzgwODYzMS9zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtdGhlLWJveXMtaW52aW5jaWJsZS1pbnRlcnZpZXc?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 18:27:28+00:00,"Box Office Preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Aims for $35 Million Debut, ‘The Meg 2’ Swimming to $30 Million","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is taking on ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" at the box office.","Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo are facing off against Barbie and Ken at the box office.
Paramount’s animated adventure “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is projected to pick up $35 million to $45 million in its first five days of release. But those ticket sales won’t be enough to dethrone “Barbie,” which is expected to top the box office for a third weekend in a row.
Greta Gerwig’s colorful fantasy comedy is eyeing $45 million to $50 million between Friday and Sunday, another huge result for the plastic fantastic blockbuster. It’s already the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $381.6 million in North America.
“TMNT” opens nationwide on Wednesday, two days ahead of another newcomer, the Warner Bros. shark sequel “Meg 2: The Trench.” Those films will vie for second place alongside Christopher Nolan’s historical drama “Oppenheimer,” now in its third weekend of release.
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” already collected $3.85 million from Tuesday’s preview screenings. The PG film cost $70 million, which is less than recent animated offerings such as Pixar’s $200 million-budgeted “Elemental” and Sony’s $100 million-budgeted “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Still, “Mutant Mayhem” needs to stick around in theaters beyond opening weekend to justify the production budget. With great reviews and positive word-of-mouth, the movie is hoping to benefit from kids who are out of school for summer vacation.
Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies seem to have faith in the film, since they are already developing a sequel, as well as a two-season Paramount+ series that will serve as a “bridge” between the big screen adventures.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the creative team behind “Superbad,” wrote and produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” Jeff Rowe, the filmmaker of the Oscar-nominated “The Mitchells vs. the Machines,” directed the film, which follows the Turtle brothers, who set out to conquer the streets of New York City after spending years sheltered from the human world. The sprawling voice cast includes Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan and Ice Cube.
“Meg 2: The Trench” is targeting $25 million to $30 million in its debut. Those estimates are a significant drop from the first film, which opened to $45 million in the pre-pandemic era. “The Meg” became a surprise smash with $145 million in North America and $530.5 million globally. The follow-up film cost $130 million, so Warner Bros. is banking on another strong turnout at the international box office.
Ben Wheatley directed the sequel, which again stars Jason Statham and centers on a group of scientists who travel to the depths of the ocean and must fend off a 75-foot-long behemoth known as a megalodon — and other terrifying sea creatures.
“Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, looks to add $23 million to $26 million in its third outing. The film has earned $181 million at the domestic box office and $419 million at the global box office, a mammoth result for a three-hour biopic that’s heavy on dialogue and light on action. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, “Tenet” ($365 million) and “Batman Begins” ($373 million).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWVzdGltYXRlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1Njg1OTMwL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWVzdGltYXRlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1Njg1OTMwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The latest TMNT film happens to have a pretty stacked voice cast attached to it, as the Ninja Turtles are voiced by Micah Abbey, Shannon Brown Jr., Nicholas Cantu, and Brady Noon. Jackie Chan and Ayo Edebiri voice Splinter and April O'Neil, respectively, while some of the more notable villains are voiced by Hollywood heavyweights John Cena (Rocksteady), Seth Rogen (Bebop), and Giancarlo Esposito (Baxter Stockman).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tZWFybHktZmFuLXNjcmVlbmluZ3MtYW5ub3VuY2VkLzExMDAtNjUxNTk1My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.
Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.
Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.
Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.
The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”
Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.
Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”
There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.
On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).
Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.
Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.
Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)
“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

2023-08-03 03:16:49.588000+00:00,Ninja Turtles seem truly like teenagers in ‘Mutant Mayhem’,"More than ever, franchise’s new adventure gives itself over to the mindset of adolescence.","There are some good gags and clever innovations in the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” but there is one brilliant idea: casting Ice Cube as the voice of the movie’s mutant insect supervillain Super Fly.
It might have once been hard to foresee the value of having the MC who rapped of “dropping bombs on your moms” as the MVP of a PG-rated kids movie. But we’re now up to the seventh “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film, not counting all the series and videogames. That’s a lot of movies for a bit of IP that’s clung more firmly to lunch boxes than it has to pop culture. For the turtles, it was getting to be time to either, as Ice Cube would say, “chickity-check yo’ self” or try something new.
“Mutant Mayhem” can’t entirely get over the feeling of trodding over well-covered turtle ground. But if we must go once more into the ooze, the film by director Jeff Rowe (co-director of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and co-written by co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is probably the best of a not-so-stellar franchise. It’s certainly the one most invested with that “teenage” part of the turtles’ name. Plus, it’s got Ice Cube as a fly who quotes from the O’Jays.
‘‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’
Untitled Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Jeff Rowe and written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit. Running time: 99 minutes. Rated PG (for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material). Now showing at local theaters.
The animation is vividly textured, the beat is persistently hip-hop (Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and others pack the electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and the New York of the film is impressively detailed. But the most important twist to this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” iteration may be diving into the teenage-ness of its 15-year-old turtles.
If “Barbie” was balanced between Greta Gerwig’s childhood memories and her adult feminism, “Mutant Mayhem” gives itself over more fully to the mindset of adolescence. That’s in the gross-out humor and the comic book-like feel of the animation. But these are also recognizable teenagers who watch movies (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”), pine for concert tickets and make goofy phone videos of themselves slicing watermelons.
What Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) and Raphael (Brady Noon) really want is to fit in and go to high school like other teens. They have been relegated to the sewer ever since Splinter, a rat voiced by Jackie Chan, happened upon them after they were exposed as hatchlings to the same ooze that spawned Super Fly — who himself was the product of experiments by scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito, fated to dubious laboratories).
Splinter has much the same opinion of the majority of the rats in “Ratatouille”: Humans can’t be trusted. (Splinter’s particular fear is that they will “milk” him.) So the turtles have grown up undergroundwhile yearning for the wider world.
They find a hint of it with a high-school journalist named April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), who wants to document, and thus prove to humankind, their decency. At the same, the turtles meet the charismatic Super Fly and his band of mutants. At first, they’re fast-friends — “cousins,” Super Fly says — but the turtles then start hearing of Super Fly’s plans to turn all animals into mutants and eradicate the world of humans.
“Peoples, they got to go,” chimes one mutant.
Some of the thunder of “Mutant Mayhem” has been stolen by “Into the Spider-Verse” and this year’s “Across the Spider-Verse” — films that likewise upend the typical look of studio animation and do it with a pulsing soundtrack; but they did it more eclectically.
Yet this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” while a half shell of those films, has its own low-key charms. It’s goofier, grosser and mostly fun. The four turtles are never more than a hard-to-differentiate bale of overlapping dialogue of doubt and anxiety. But that first word in their name finally feels genuine. Seven films in, it’s only right that Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael should get a renaissance.

Published Aug 02, 2023
In April 1984, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's black-and-white comic book Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit the newsstands, introducing the world to New York City's favourite heroes in a half-shell. Leonardo, the group's de facto leader, heads the charge as he announces his and his brothers, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael, presence to the Purple Dragons, emphatically proclaiming, ""We're not wearing costumes.""In the nearly 40 years since, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have gone from comic book superheroes to action figures to TV and movie stars and around the world, kids have marked their allegiance with their favourite Turtle (for the record, mine is Michelangelo, for obvious reasons). For generations of children, TMNT dominated recess, Halloween and playtime from Canada to England to Japan, igniting our imaginations as we went into battle with Splinter, April and Casey.In recent years, the Turtles were given the live-action treatment — but in T eenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (in theatres now), our boys are back in animated form. Directed by Jeff Rowe and co-written by Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg , Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, Mutant Mayhem takes us back to the beginning with an all-star cast and killer soundtrack.But before we dive into the sewers for some pizza, here are five facts about the film that you might not know. Cowabunga, dude!Normally in animated films, the voice cast are brought to a sound booth separately to record their individual parts, with crafty editors stitching everything together in post-production. However, in 2019's The Lion King, Seth Rogen, who voiced Pumbaa, was able to actually record alongside Donald Glover and Billy Eichner, the film's Simba and Timon, respectively.Rogen's experience was so positive that he wanted to ensure that the voice actors in Mutant Mayhem were given the same opportunity, telling The Hollywood Reporter , ""We really went out of our way and bent over backwards on Ninja Turtles to try to capture that improvisational energy that you get when a lot of people are in the same place at the same time.""And the proof is in the pudding. Not only is the chemistry between the four Turtles — Nicolas Cantu (Leonardo), Micah Abbey (Donatello), Brady Noon (Raphael) and Shamon Brown Jr. (Michelangelo) — free-flowing and natural, seasoned comedians like Jackie Chan, Hannibal Buress, Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph, and of course, Rogen himself, are clearly relishing in the shared space.Given the name of the group, oddly, the past TMNT works have rarely explored the boys' teenage side. Rowe and Rogen — the latter of whom has a rich and successful resume creating teen comedies — wanted to position Mutant Mayhem as a high school movie, detailing the natural angst involved in growing up as outcasts in society with an over-protective parent.In developing the coming-of-age nature of Mutant Mayhem, Rowe was influenced by the classic films of the genre as well as more modern examples like The Edge of Seventeen and PEN15. ""We wanted it to be like Stand by Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" Rowe told Empire . Naturally, Rogen's Freaks and Geeks and Superbad, also stood in as sources of inspiration, particularly in the humour of Mutant Mayhem.As the first animated TMNT film since 2007, Rowe (who co-directed The Mitchells vs. The Machines ) had his work cut out for him, especially considering audience standards for animation are currently at an all-time high. To create the gorgeous and vivid animation in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen turned to the animation studios of Mikros and Cinesite.Mikros Animation, the animation house behind the PAW Patrol films, utilized hundreds of animators and VFX artists in their Montreal and Paris offices to create the incredible comic book-style artwork, that includes sketches that resemble high school notebook doodling. Cinesite's Vancouver team, a visual effects powerhouse that has worked on Game of Thrones and World War Z, were also tapped to develop the dynamic imagery of Mutant Mayhem that not only brings to life TMNT's comic book roots, but the '90s aesthetic as well.In addition to the electrifying score by Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross , Mutant Mayhem boasts an awesome soundtrack. ""It's a lot of songs that me and Jeff Rowe, the director, ourselves listen to,"" Rogen told ET Canada To reflect the New York City setting and '90s timeframe, Rogen and Rowe curated songs with a heavy '90s East Coast hip-hop and R&B influence, including Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"" and Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya."" The seemingly random assortment of songs on the soundtrack reflect the frenetic nature of a teenager-made mixtape, with the energy and spirit of youth found throughout.Just as important as the Turtles is their father, Splinter. Voiced by Jackie Chan in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen really leaned into the character's dad vibe, as well as the DIY nature of putting together a look living in a sewer.""Jeff Bridges's the Dude character from The Big Lebowski was a big fashion inspiration,"" Mutant Mayhem's lead character designer Woodrow White explained to Den of Geek . ""Splinter's build was [also] partially inspired by Danny DeVito, with his short stature and long arms.""Chan's contributions to the film even go beyond voicing Splinter. Studying Chan's fighting style in films like Police Story and Rumble in the Bronx, Rowe brought the splashy editing and comedic rhythm of those legendary fight sequences into Mutant Mayhem, resulting in some high-energy, action-packed moments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZXhjbGFpbS5jYS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNsYWltLmNhL2FtcGFydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-04 17:30:46+00:00,'Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem': Rose Byrne on Channeling Eric Bana,Rose Byrne talks about voicing Leatherhead in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.”,"Rose Byrne jumped at the chance to voice Leatherhead in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” when producer-star Seth Rogen asked her to join the film. “It was ridiculous,” the “Physical” actor tells me. “Seth was like, ‘I want you to do just fully Aussie — just go for it!’
“I was like, ‘I’m going to do my best Eric Bana.’ This is an homage to Eric,” Byrne continues. “It was a group recording, and I’d never done that before for a voice job. Seth was there, and he had such high energy from beginning to end. There’s ‘Mayhem’ in the title, and it was like mayhem. Not in a bad way. It was fun mayhem.”
Byrne joked that her many collaborations with Rogen, which include the 2014 comedy “Neighbors” and Apple TV+’s “Platonic,” don’t have her husband, Bobby Cannavale, worried. “He’s our biggest cheerleader,” she says. “He totally gets it. He’s like, ‘You’re so different and it just works.’ It’s really cute.”
Variety exclusively reported that Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies are developing a sequel to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” as well as a two-season series that will serve as a “bridge” between the films. The spinoff series, titled “Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” will be streamed on Paramount+.
The sequel will be produced by Point Grey Pictures and directed by Jeff Rowe, who is also the director and co-writer of “Mutant Mayhem.” Point Grey Pictures is also producing the Paramount+ series.

""He wants to rip down a skyscraper.""","The cast of voice actors in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is absolutely stacked. Still, a major standout among the A-list crowd is West Coast rap legend Ice Cube. Playing Superfly—a mutant fly who wants mutants to rule the world over humans—his mutant animal gang also features voice work from Paul Rudd, Post Malone, Hannibal Buress, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and more.
Of course, though, Ice Cube's Superfly is in charge—and he even quotes Ice-T's ""6 in the Mornin'"" in the film, while he's (what else?) pummeling down on our beloved turtles. ""You get to be evil and nasty,"" he tels Esquire in the latest episode of ""Explain This."" Who would like to play the villain? ""But what's cool about Superfly is that he has a heart,"" Cube continues. ""He just wants to be liked, and when you don't like him then he wants to rip down a skyscraper.""
The former N.W.A. member also reminisced about his time filming 21 Jump Street, receiving boos booed when he performed on the East Coast for the time, and a young John Singleton hounding him for two years before agreeing to do Boyz n the Hood. ""I would run into him and he would be like, Yo, I'm a senior at USC, I'm gonna do this movie with you, Cube,"" Cube recalled. ""And I'd be like, Yeah, man whatever. The rest was kinda history, and he's definitely changed my life with that movie.""

2023-07-20 20:18:04+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Kicks Off Comic-Con With 20 Minutes of Footage,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Mayhem brought 20 minutes of footage to San Diego Comic-Con's Hall H.,"It may not have had the star power fans or the studio hoped for, but Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem kicked off the movie panels at San Diego Comic-Con in fine style.
Due to the writers and actors strikes, the studio didn’t have Seth Rogen, who is both one of the movie’s producers and actors, nor any other voice stars. But it did bring out director Jeff Rowe and plenty of footage from the movie.
Twenty minutes of footage, to be precise. Rowe showed off a chunk from the beginning of the movie and, judging by the reaction, it went over gangbusters. The hall, while not packed in the usual way, still had thousands in their seats, and the audience was howling for the film, which opens Aug. 2 in theaters.
Unspooling was an introduction to the four turtle heroes, making a night run for groceries around town, deciding to catch a movie in the park (Ferris Bueller’s Day Off — a Paramount movie, naturally), and thinking how great life would be if only they could be liked by humans and have normal lives. What follows is getting grounded by their father, Splinter, a recap of their origin, an intro to the bad guy, and then their first meeting with human girl April O’Neil, which leaves a bunch of crooks messed up.
And while Rogen wasn’t in attendance, he did make his presence felt via two videos, one which detailed a quick history of the Turtles phenomenon, and another which, paired with Ice Cube (and said to have been made a month ago, before the SAG-AFTRA strike), talked about the movie in general.
Rowe, meanwhile, talked up how much the Turtles meant to him as a child. “It’s what taught me to be a fan,” he said.
And he said Rogen pushed for the angle of focusing on the “teenage” aspect of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, something he thought was underserved.
The film’s art style is a break from the shiny and polished look of many other animated movies, with the filmmakers making the choice to emulate an underground comic vibe.
“We looked at how we used to draw in high school, when you’re so passionate but you don’t know how to draw but you don’t know that you don’t know how to draw yet,” said Rowe. “So you’ll lovingly draw a hand, drawing every fingernail, every wrinkle, but the hand is horribly misshapen. There is no formal art training to encumber your pure expression. And we said, let’s do that.”
The panel wrapped with a surprise appearance by TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman, who announced that Nickelodeon and Paramount have secured the rights to the original TMNT animated series that aired in the late 1980s. He did not give details as to when and on what platform the series would appear.
“It’s been almost 40 years and I’m still drawing Turtles thanks to you guys,” he said, nodding to the power of fandom.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1jb21pYy1jb24tMTIzNTU0MDY3NS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1raWNrcy1vZmYtY29taWMtY29uLTEyMzU1NDA2NzUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-14 13:26:11+00:00,The New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Feels Surprisingly Jewish – Kveller,,"Warning: spoilers for “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and slightly embarrassing geekiness ahead.
When I grew watching “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” in Israel (imagine saying “Cowabunga” with a Hebrew accent), I never anticipated that the franchise would be the source of future parenting lessons, and yet, here we are.
I was really excited when my 5-year-old son took interested in the “TMNT” franchise earlier this year. He memorized the names of the characters, friends and villains. We read early reading books about their adventures together. We even watched some episode of the 1990s cartoon (though yes, we had to skip some that were too scary). Raising my kids with a love of Judaism is one of my biggest priorities as a parent, but raising them to share my love for the dorky franchises that buoyed me throughout my childhood also gives me much joy.
And so, last weekend, I eagerly took him and my brother, who was in town from Israel, to watch the new “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” directed by Jeff Rowe and produced and co-written by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. Rogen even introduced the movie himself in an adorable little clip, telling viewers to enjoy the film. I relate to Rogen, who says, “For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Fan.” I imagined my son saying that one day, too.
The movie is visually stunning. The 3D animation by French Mikros Animation studio has a lot of texture to it and feels appropriately grungy and edgy while still really beautiful. The music is absolutely infectious, with lots of ’90s hip-hop that had us shaking our legs and tapping along. And while some of the jokes feel a little belabored (there’s a milking joke I really couldn’t get into), we all laughed at multiple points in the movie. It’s genuinely a really funny, delightful watch. Or at least it was for me (more on that in a bit).
A lot of changes have been made to the story of the turtles, originally conceived as a subversive comic book in the late 1980s by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This story really leans into the identities of Donatello (Donnie), Michelangelo (Mikey), Raphael (Raph) and Leonardo (Leo), which I really loved — from the choice of voice actors to making their bodies more adolescent sized. I love that April was played by Ayo Edebiri (who is in everything right now, from “The Bear” to the upcoming Emma Seligman movie “Bottoms”). Yet one the most significant updates was made to the character of Splinter, the turtles’ father figure, dubbed in the movie by the brilliant and lovable Jackie Chan. He is no longer a former Japanese ninjutsu turned humanoid rat but a former sewer rat who, like the group of turtle hatchlings, walked into a radioactive goo that turned him into a mutant.
The choice makes more sense, as even Splinter himself says in the movie, but it’s also a big part of the movie’s central narrative. As a former rat, Splinter has a natural apprehension of people, and when he steps into New York’s Times Square, he’s met with so much terror and derision that he never steps up onto the surface again.
The story of that frightening encounter becomes family lore, with Splinter warning his growing children of the human world and training them to fight and defend themselves from the vile humans.
This character of an overprotective father who wants to keep his children in an insular world is certainly universal, or at least familiar for many immigrant cultures. And a lot of stories with mutant heroes make for excellent parables about prosecuted minorities. Yet both my brother and I agreed that what he really felt like was an old Jewish dad, kvetchy and fearful, paranoid about the dangers of the outside world (we all know there is some truth to the hypochondriac Jewish dad caricature) but also overtly loving, affectionate and dedicated (and full of dad jokes).
Splinter’s redesign, which is less aging svelte athlete and more stout and grey, makes him feel almost Tevye-like, as in the protagonist of “Fiddler on the Roof” (which makes sense from Goldberg and especially Rogen, who basically played a version of Tevye in the movie “An American Pickle”). Splinter’s fear of the influence of the human world feels quite comparable to the experience of Jewish assimilation. Splinter wants to keep the turtles close, safe, with their own kind, and holds fast to the predictable rituals of training and pizza dinners. He’s all about hard-earned traditions.
But the turtles want more — they want to be part of the human world. They sneak off to movie screenings, they love anime and video games, skating and making amateur videos — and like any teenagers, they want to belong to something larger than just their nuclear family. They want to make friends! And they have to hide all of that from their father. Throughout most of the movie, the turtles try to track down and fight Flyguy — the movie’s villain, dubbed by the incredible Ice Cube — without their father’s knowledge.
When the turtles get in trouble, Splinter discovers the turtles have been sneaking behind his back, and his response is obvious disappointment. While he agrees to help them out (he is, after all, a good caring father) he vows never to let them return to the human world again after the ordeal is through.
That is, until he experiences a parenting epiphany. It’s a moment when Splinter sees his own inflexibility and harshness as a parent reflected in Flyguy and the way he treats his army of kids, or rather, mutant underlings (which include the adorable skateboarding Mondo Gecko, voiced by a darling Paul Rudd, and a singing Ray Fillet voiced by Post Malone). It’s surprisingly touching. It’s rare to see a parent get that kind of wake up call and answer it, but Splinter does just that.
He realizes that his own values, his own fear of humans, are his, and that he can and should allow his children to live the kind of life they want to — and for that, he needs to get over his paranoias. Part of being a parent, especially a parent whose seen and experienced persecution for his identity, is letting your kids be braver than you were, knowing that they’re growing up in a different world, and that they are allowed to learn their own lessons. It’s also learning to care for the things your kids care about and being their cheerleader. Splinter has a full arc in which he grows for the sake of his kids, and ultimately, that helps him find his own happiness (which involves a pretty disturbing romance with a fellow mutant, but hey, parents are allowed to be a bit kinky too).
As Jewish parents, a lot of us were raised with fears of persecution, fears of the unknown, with fear in general, and there’s something so valuable in letting that go, no matter how scary it may be. The turtles’ dreams of feeling acceptance and belonging in the outside world may seem farfetched; they are, after all, literal mutants. But in the end, by being authentic and kind, they make them happen.
The movie outing was meant to be fun, a bonding experience for my son and his uncle, and in a sense, it was. Yet, just like Splinter in the movie, the experience of watching it was also a bit of a parenting fail, and a lesson, for me.
From the moment the movie opened with an armed raid, I realized I might have made a mistake. Like many a 5-year-old, my son does not like scary movies and TV shows, and his definition of scary is a lot more broad than most, including anything remotely violent or rage-filled.
It was all fine, more or less, with a few cuddle and hand-holding sessions, and lots of popcorn noshing on his part, until we got to the movie’s biggest battle — with its biggest, most frightening monsters. He turned to me and said the words I had been dreading: “I want to go.”
“We can leave,” I told him, “but I’d like you to stay until the end, to see that there’s a happy ending.” The screening was a kid-friendly one, so talking out loud was not taboo. As we watched the dramatic final scene (which was, yeah, pretty gruesome and violent, even by regular “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” standards), my brother and I both tried to explain to him what was going on — comparing it to the video game they had played the day before, telling him that here, all these people are coming together as a community to defeat the villain. We ended up leaving the theater in an OK shape, though I can’t say that my son really enjoyed the movie, and I’m still wondering if I handled it as best I could.
Perhaps, in that moment, I was so over-enthused about passing down a childhood tradition that I forgot to let my kid dictate his own rhythm. I didn’t hear his initial reluctance about watching this movie, and I didn’t realize that he was not even super into this franchise anymore (he’s all about Mario now). Perhaps I should’ve let him leave the theater when he wanted to, or not gone at all when he first waffled about heading to see the film.
All in all, I don’t think I traumatized him in any major way. But the movie was a good reminder for me, as a parent, to respect my kids — when they’re brave, of course, and want to take on the world, but also when they’re fearful.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt2ZWxsZXIuY29tL3RoZS1uZXctdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tb3ZpZS1mZWVscy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nbHktamV3aXNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 14:00:00+00:00,How Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Puts a Fresh Spin on the Franchise,"Actual teenagers and a fresh, wild art style mark a new era for the classic franchise in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","This appreciation dripped into the team’s approach to Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen says the filmmakers strove to keep what was drafted in the concept art. “I’ve been through this process so many times where you see the concept art and by the time you’re making the movie, it has lost all of its energy. That did not happen here,” he reveals. “It was asymmetrical and imperfect. I remember the first time seeing it dimensionalized, and it blew my mind.”
The Turtles in the Room
The story and style of Mutant Mayhem boast teenage vigor, but to hear adults voicing the core team would betray all that the filmmakers envisioned. So it was critical that, for the first time ever, the Ninja Turtles are played by actual teenagers. “Part of the spirit we were trying to capture was to make the movie fun, like kids playing with toys,” says Rogen, revealing that even his adult co-stars had fun playing off each other IRL. “That was something we talked about. How do we make it feel fun and silly? This reckless weirdness that almost every kid playing with their toys has?”
Actors Nicolas Cantu (The Walking Dead: World Beyond), Brady Noon (Good Boys), Shamon Brown Jr. (The Chi), and Micah Abbey (Grey’s Anatomy) voice Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, respectively. In an unusual turn for any major animation project, Mutant Mayhem recorded the cast in-person, together, allowing them to improvise lines. The goal was to capture the authenticity of teens hanging out—something that no adult screenwriter can replicate in Final Draft.
Casting was “arduous,” according to Rogen. Citing his own experiences in voiceover work, Rogen strove to mitigate factors that can sometimes leave animation projects feeling inauthentic. “A recurring frustration I have is that you never perform with the other actors,” he says. “The magic of our work that people like is a result of being in the moment and playing off each other. That energy was important to capture. So we went through painstaking lengths to make sure that as much as possible, they all recorded together.”
Fittingly, this approach to recording enabled the filmmakers to see their adolescent stars slowly become their characters—and vice versa. “They’re very much [acting like] themselves,” Rowe says. “So much of the dialogue is just things they said to each other.
I cannot think of another animated film at this scale that’s worked that way, in casting kids and letting them be their authentic selves. We wanted these characters to be complex and feel like people you knew.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1uZXctc3Bpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The film enjoyed generous preview screenings ahead of its opening Wednesday and has earned an eye-popping $247.5 million already.
Meg 2: The Trench, the giant shark action sequel co-produced by Warner Bros. and China’s CMC Pictures, slipped to third place in its second weekend with $16.7 for the frame and $91 million overall. Chinese fantasy blockbuster Creation of the Gods 1: Kingdom of Storms climbed back into second place, taking in $26.8 million for a hefty $283.4 million four-weekend total, according to data from Artisan Gateway.
Paramount Pictures’ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, meanwhile, bombed with a three-day start of just under $1 million — despite the presence of Chinese action icon Jackie Chan in the starring voice cast. The flop continues a trend of Hollywood titles struggling to break through at China’s box office. Local ticketing service Maoyan projects Ninja Turtles to top out in China with just $1.5 million.
No More Bets is executive produced by Chinese hitmaker Ning Hao (Crazy Alien) and directed by relative newcomer Shen Ao. The film follows a computer programmer (Lay Zhang) and a model (Gina Jin) who are enticed abroad by the promise of high-paying jobs but find themselves duped by a ruthless gang and forced to participate in online fraud. Ao has said that he researched hundreds of cases of a real-life cyber fraud cases involving Chinese citizens as part of his writing process. Maoyan forecasts that No More Bets will finish its run with over $500 million, which will make it China’s biggest hit of the summer.
Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which got a surprise box-office boost from cosmopolitan young Chinese women, has begun winding down in the market. It has earned $35.8 million to date, with Maoyan forecasting only slight gains to come.

If the new animation spawns a franchise, that is...
""We'll Dark Knight it,"" Rowe jokes to SFX magazine in the new issue, which features Good Omens season 2 on the cover, before adding that he'd ""100%"" love to develop a sequel. ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""
In TMNT lore, Shredder is the archenemy of the titular Turtles' mentor Splinter, who is voiced in the new film by Jackie Chan. Various iterations of the character, who is most often known as Oroku Saki, have have been depicted over time, including human and non-human, as well as both male and female.
As you might expect, Mutant Mayhem centers on righteous reptilians Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, as they set out to win the hearts of their fellow New Yorkers, after years of being sheltered from the human world. Alongside their new friend, April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the anthropomorphic foursome attempt to take down a mysterious crime syndicate, but find themselves in over their shells when they become the target of an army of mutants.
Seth Rogen, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, John Cena, and Paul Rudd are among the star-studded voice cast. It releases on August 4.

""That was our cornerstone for everything, like making the Turtles not hulking, ripped versions of themselves, but lanky and awkward. That carried through into casting actual teenagers. It's insane that it had never been done before."" Here, the eponymous quartet are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr.

Director Jeff Rowe told Insider that he learned several Gen Z phrases while making the film.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" director Jeff Rowe said that he learned lots of new phrases from the movie's Gen Z cast members.
Rowe and producer Seth Rogen cast teen actors, whose ages range between 15 and 19, to voice the titular turtles, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.
The cast — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Brady Noon, and Nicolas Cantu — recorded their lines together in the same booth in order to allow them to riff off each other.
In an interview with Insider, Rowe said that some of the conversations between the turtles in the movie were improvised by the actors.
""There's this very funny scene where the turtles are just talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. Like, 'Hey, we're gonna be like real New Yorkers. Get a bacon egg, and cheese sandwich.' And they're all like quoting different YouTube videos that they watch and they just go off for like a minute talking about that,"" Rowe said.

""We didn't script that. They just did that in between takes. I think they were just legitimately talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. And then they were like, 'Make sure you're rolling,'"" the director continued.

Rowe added: ""And then we just put that in the film. It's totally improvised and totally not planned. It's unwritable. I don't think you can write that.""
Rowe said that he and the producers had to check if the teens' conversations were appropriate for the PG-13 movie, especially when they used Gen Z slang.
""I learned what 'rizz' is,"" Rowe said. ""They would say stuff and then we'd be like, 'Cool. Just say it like that. Wait, is that offensive? Is that beyond PG-13? What? Okay. No? It's cool.'""
Rizz is short for charisma and is used in romantic situations when a person is able to effortlessly charm another person.

Seth Rogen is among the creatives showing off the unique animation style for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle: Mutant Mayhem, which Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies will open on Aug. 4.
“The bigger swing these animated movies are taking, the more excited people seem to be like that,” says Rogen in a new featurette.
In the story, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
“They had to feel like real teenagers,” says writer/director Jeff Rowe of the pizza-loving Turtles, which extended to creating a visual style as if it were animated by teens.
“What we wanted to do was create an incredibly fun and engaging version of the Ninja Turtles,” says Rogen, a producer, writer and the voice of Bebop.
Ice Cube, who voices Superfly adds that “the animation and flavor of the movie was so original and fresh.”

2023-08-05 15:16:39+00:00,"Box Office: ‘TMNT,’ ‘Meg 2’ Racing Against ‘Oppenheimer’ for Second as ‘Barbie’ Reign Continues","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and ""Meg 2: The Trench"" openings look to take second from ""Oppenheimer,"" as ""Barbie"" stays on top.","The summer box office season may have reached the dog days of August, but it’s hardly looked stronger over the past few months. Though the openings of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Meg 2: The Trench” won’t be able to take down “Barbie” as the top performer in North America, both new releases are boosting theaters to a weekend with four different features grossing north of $25 million.
Paramount Pictures’ “Mutant Mayhem” added $9.3 million from 3,858 locations on Friday, tracking neck-and-neck with “Oppenheimer” for second place on domestic charts. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, opened with Tuesday evening preview screenings and is now tracking for a $42 million five-day debut — squarely within the projections of $35 million to $45 million heading into the weekend.
That’s not shabby for the “TMNT” entry, which cost only $70 million to produce — an especially economical figure for an animated studio release. Paramount has managed to capitalize on strong buzz as both an effective nostalgia play and a modern spin on the ’80s property. The 90% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes brought momentum into the weekend, and the glowing “A” grade through research firm Cinema Score shows early audiences are digging the latest adventures of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. As the summer season winds down, “Mutant Mayhem” should find some steady play.
The “TMNT” entry features a celebrity voice cast including Jackie Chan, Ayo Edebiri, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube and Seth Rogen, plus a group of young stars — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon — voicing the Turtle Brothers, emphasizing the first “T” of “TMNT.” Jeff Rowe directs.
Meanwhile, “Meg 2: The Trench” chowed down on $12 million from 3,503 theaters on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.2 million in Thursday previews. The hungry, hungry sequel from Warner Bros. is still tracking for an opening with a ceiling of $30 million. That’s a chunk behind the 2018 original, which saw Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against two gigantic sharks. “The Meg” earned $45 million in its domestic opening and finished with $145 million in North America and $530 million worldwide.
As its predecessor did, “The Trench,” which sees Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against even more gigantic sharks, will look to international territories as its main course to replenish a $129 million production budget. Notably, the sequel adds Wu Jing to its cast — a colossal star in China who has anchored local mega-hits such as “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” “Wolf Warrior” and “The Wandering Earth.” In fact, though Wu’s character perished in the first “Wandering Earth” entry, its follow-up was conceived as a prequel so that the actor could return to star.
Not that the first “Meg” was an awards season heavyweight, but “The Trench” hasn’t performed well in reviews (a 33% from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences also seem to be cooler on the sequel, turning in a “B” grade on Cinema Score, down from the “B+” earned by the first entry. Consensus opinion may be that the franchise has jumped the… well… but a spectacular reception would’ve marked a bit of a marketing misdirect, to put it frankly.
“Meg 2: The Trench” sees Statham and Wu team up with Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, Cliff Curtis and Sienna Guillory to take down not one, not two, but three prehistoric sharks, along with a bunch of other sea creatures. Beguilingly, the feature is based on a novel, “The Trench” by Steve Alten, and helmed by “Kill List” and “High-Rise” director Ben Wheatley, making the jump to big-budget filmmaking.
Neither sharks nor turtles can take down “Barbie” though, which added $17 million on Friday, down only 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. release has been a dominant force since scoring the biggest opening of the year and there aren’t really any signs of stopping. The hot-pink comedy will likely surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales within the next day or two.
Still the hottest ticket in the nation, “Barbie” should surge beyond a $450 million domestic gross through Sunday, placing it hot on the heels of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) to become the highest-earning North American release of the year.
It’ll be a close call for “Oppenheimer,” which may finally need to surrender second place on domestic charts to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” or “Meg 2: The Trench.” Then again, it may not. The Christopher Nolan feature is projecting $28.7 million for the weekend, which would be down an impressively slim 39% from its previous outing.
The sweeping biopic has surpassed $200 million in North America and looks to keep playing through August, already having extended its tenure in Imax auditoriums. It’s a formidable performance for such a grim chatterbox of a film, which ranks among Nolan’s top four domestic grossers ever after just two weeks of release.
The floor is collapsing under Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which earned $2.6 million on its second Friday, down a staggering 73% from its debut. The family-friendly funhouse feature should push beyond a $40 million domestic gross on Saturday — not exactly the desired return for a film with a $150 million production budget. With plenty of competition for audiences’ attention, “Haunted Mansion” may be off to an early grave.
Notably, the unlikely summer hit “Sound of Freedom” continues to perform well in its sixth weekend of release. Competitors project the feature about child sex trafficking will drop only 39% this weekend, boosting its domestic haul to $164 million — enough to surpass “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” ($156 million) to become one of the top 10 highest-grossing North American releases of the year.
The Angel Studios release has drawn a substantial amount of skepticism among box office watchers. After the credits roll on the thriller, star Jim Caviezel appears on screen to speak directly to audiences, saying that he believes “we can make ‘Sound of Freedom’ the ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of 21st-century slavery” and presenting a QR code that directs viewers to the distributor’s unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing users to donate money to Angel Studios so that it may purchase tickets for its own film and distribute them to those that request free admission. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.
It’s unclear to what degree the program has buoyed the box office fortunes of “Sound of Freedom,” but religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind the feature and a superlative “A+” grade on Cinema Score indicates that its audience is certainly enthusiastic about it. And regardless, those “Pay It Forward” ticket sales are still putting money in the pocket of exhibitors — whether people show up or not.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 13:09:31+00:00,"'Mutant Mayhem 2' Villain Confirmed, Other Iconic Characters May Also Appear - Inside the Magic",Expect some very familiar faces in 'Mutant Mayhem 2'.,"Which iconic villains will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is currently entertaining audiences of all ages in movie theaters and has opened to glowing reviews and impressive box office figures ($51.6 million worldwide to date, against a $70 million budget).
The film has an impressive assortment of heroes and villains, but it’s the latter that boasts the most where A-list actors are concerned. There’s Seth Rogen (Bebop), John Cena (Rocksteady), Rose Byrne (Leatherhead), Ice Cube (Superfly), Paul Rudd (Mondo Gecko), and Giancarlo Esposito (Baxter Stockman), to name a few. But with the exception of Bebop and Rocksteady, Mutant Mayhem is missing some major iconic villains.

In an interview with Den of Geek at San Diego Comic-Con, Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe talked about where things might go in the next movie, which, looking at the critical reception for the current film and, more importantly, the box office takings, is inevitable.
“I think a lot of people are gonna want more,” Rowe said. “These characters are so wonderful, this casting is so wonderful, you just love spending time with them. The Turtles’ world is a big one. There’s a lot left to explore. Conversations are happening, and it would be really exciting to let these characters keep on living and breathing.”
One of those conversations is undoubtedly centered around the Turtles’ iconic arch nemesis.

Warning: there are major spoilers ahead for Mutant Mayhem!
During a mid-credits scene, the Ninja Turtles, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), are adjusting to life at Eastman High with their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri).
However, it’s revealed that TCRI head Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who earlier in the film failed to extract the Ninja Turtles’ mutagen-blood to create an army of mutant soldiers, has surveillance on our half-shell heroes. Before the scene ends, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder, who we see standing in the dark near Brooklyn Bridge.

In a recent interview with SFX magazine, when discussing whether or not The Shredder will show up in Mutant Mayhem 2, Rowe jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger), who was missing from the first film in the series, Batman Begins (2005).
Fans hungry for another slice of Ninja Turtles won’t need to wait long, though. Paramount has already greenlit a 2D animated series for Paramount+ later this year, titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2023), that will follow on from Mutant Mayhem, as part of a planned TMNT shared universe.
Related: New ‘Ninja Turtles’ Trailer Predictably Angers Anti-Woke Mob With Character of Color
The mid-credits scene confirms that The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2. He may even show up in the 2D animated series, but it’s likely Nickelodeon will want to save the silver samurai for the silver screen.
While The Shredder is a somewhat exhausted villain, we’ve no doubt that the “Mutant Mayhem-verse” will offer a fresh take on the character, just as the first film has done with its roster of mutants. But which other iconic villains from the wider TMNT universe do we need to see in the sequel?
The Shredder
Many fans would argue that you can’t have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (or show) without The Shredder, the franchise’s most iconic villain. But Oroku Saki was actually killed off in the first volume of the original Mirage Studios comic books in the ’80s.
Be that as it may, the 1987 cartoon series immortalized the character, as he went on to appear in numerous iterations on the small screen, in comic books, video games, and four out of seven of the theatrical movies (not counting Mutant Mayhem‘s mid-credits scene).
Now that we know The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2, it’s high time for something very different. While the Michael Bay-produced 2014 live-action film gave us a “Transformer” version of the character, we’re hoping for something a bit more subtle.
Related: All 12 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Explained (Yes, 12!)
The Foot
You can’t have The Shredder without the Foot (known also as the Foot Clan or the Foot Soldiers). His legion of ninja followers are often depicted as wearing black bodysuits to blend in with the dark, and with large, bug-like eyes on their masks (a bit like Spider-Man).
The Foot are hardly the front and center of TMNT‘s extensive rogues gallery, but they’re just as iconic as The Shredder, largely because they’re so heavily associated with him. Assuming Mutant Mayhem‘s version of The Shredder is a ninja, then the Foot are a no-brainer.
In the mid-credits scene, we only see the side of The Shredder’s helmet, and the spikes on his shoulder pad. He certainly looks like a ninja, but whether or not he’s Oroku Saki remains to be seen. But as Splinter (Jackie Chan) isn’t the Hamato Yoshi version, who shares a history with Saki, it’s unlikely.

Krang
For many fans, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) remains a bit of a mystery. This is understandable, because Mutant Mayhem doesn’t reveal much about her, other than the fact she heads up TCRI, and wants the Turtles’ blood to create super-soldiers.
In the mid-credits scene, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder to help her capture the Turtles now that they’re in high school and surrounded by people, as opposed to living in the shadows. But who is Cynthia Utrom?
Well, we know the word “Utrom” is the name given to Krang’s species — yes, the Krang, from the many cartoons and comic books and live-action movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) — and we know that they love to make mutant armies.
Cynthia Utrom’s human form is probably a robot, with a Krang operating from the inside, who is most likely female, especially when you consider that the mutants Leatherhead (Rose Byrne) and Wingnut (Natasha Demetriou) are female versions of past iterations.

Baxter Stockman
While Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) already appears in Mutant Mayhem’s opening sequence, there’s plenty of room for him to appear in the sequel. The tricky part is that Stockman is (apparently) killed before the opening credits, but he could always show up in a flashback sequence, or some kind video diary footage.
The sequel may even reveal that Superfly (Ice Cube) is the same person as Baxter Stockman. In previous iterations of TMNT, Baxter is Superfly, as part of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like mutation storyline, however, in Mutant Mayhem, both characters are entirely separate. As far as we’re told anyway, as Superfly’s hair looks suspiciously similar to Baxter’s.

Casey Jones
We know what you’re thinking: Casey Jones isn’t a villain. But Mutant Mayhem doesn’t appear to be following the TMNT playbook all that much. For starters, most of its mutant characters were born as animals, such as Superfly, Bebop, and Rocksteady, whereas in previous iterations they are humans who are transformed into mutant animals.
And don’t get us started on all the lore the film completely ignores, from Splinter’s backstory with The Shredder, which seems to have been thrown out of the window, to the fact that the Ninja Turtles end up in high school. A bold and admirable direction, for sure, but loyal to the TMNT mythology this film ain’t. This could work in its favors, though.
Casey Jones, the hockey stick-wielding vigilante, could be introduced a villain, which would create an interesting dynamic between Casey and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and in turn, the Ninja Turtles.

This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.
Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)
The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.
“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)
A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)
Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.
“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)
Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.
“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)
A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”
“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)
Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.
“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)
Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.
“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)
Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.
“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)
Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?
“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)
Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.
“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)
Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.

Time to get into some limited releases …
“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)
The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.
“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)
Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.
“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)
Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.
“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)
Another popular horror film from this year’s Sundance is Laura Moss’ twist on Frankenstein with the underrated Marin Ireland playing a morgue technician trying to reanimate her little girl using materials from a pregnant woman (Judy Reyes).
“The Adults” (Variance – Aug. 18)
Michael Cera, Sophia Lillis (“Stranger Things,” “Enola Holmes”) and Hannah Gross star in the latest indie dramedy from Dustin Guy Defa (“Person to Person”), playing siblings dealing with the death of their mother. It premiered at Berlin earlier this year, then played Tribeca Festival.
“Bottoms” (United Artists – Aug. 25)
At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.
“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)
This stop-motion animated film written and directed by Jim Capobianco follows the life of Leonardo da Vinci with a voice cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Daisy Ridley, Stephen Fry and Matt Berry. (This is also getting a moderate release in a very busy late August weekend.)
“Scrapper” (Kino Lorber – Aug. 25)
Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) plays the absent father of a child (Lola Campbell) who decides to live on her own after her mother dies in this feature directorial debut from Charlotte Regan.
That’s it for this month. September will be all about the festivals and the official start of Oscar season as the box office tends to slow down even more.

Thanks to the nature of the medium, actors in animation don't have to be in the same room together to share a scene. In most productions, actors' voices are recorded and edited ahead of time, and the animators add their physical acting after the fact. It's typically more common for animated productions to record each of their actors separately, then edit together a vocal track before the animation begins. Indeed, if one has ever seen a behind-the-scenes video of voice actors in a booth, one might see how recording lines can become very tedious as actors will have to repeat single lines over and over again until the director hears a take they like. It's quite rare for actors to play out entire scenes the way they appear in a final animated product.
In certain television shows over the years, however, that practice has been eschewed. Some producers prefer their actors retain their ability to play off each other, reacting in real-time, talking over each other, and generally lending a more natural performance to the show in question. This was famously done for shows like ""Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,"" ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""The Powerpuff Girls,"" and ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" all of which liked to gather as much of their cast as possible into one recording booth.
In movies, entire-cast recordings are all but unheard of, save for a few notable pairings. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, for instance, recorded their lines together for ""Toy Story,"" as did John Goodman and Billy Crystal for ""Monsters, Inc."" Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro shared a booth for ""Shark Tale."" And, according to a recent behind-the-scenes interview with executive producer Seth Rogen, the four lead actors of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (in theaters August 2) did the same.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM0MTk4Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmVjb3JkZWQtdG9nZXRoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-13 12:09:46+00:00,'Mutant Mayhem' Actor Open to Returning in 'The Last Ronin' Movie - Inside the Magic,The 'Mutant Mayhem' actor is open to reprising his role in 'The Last Ronin' movie.,"This Mutant Mayhem actor wants to return for The Last Ronin movie.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is the latest iteration of TMNT in film. But unlike previous entries, this time all the focus is on the teenage aspects of the Ninja Turtles, while the film is easily the most family-friendly of all seven.
So, fans hoping for a dark and gritty take on the half-shell heroes, particularly those who are familiar with the ongoing comic book series, “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) from IDW Publishing, may walk away understandably disappointed.

While Mutant Mayhem is heavily marketed towards younger audiences, none of the films, or the numerous television shows, are geared towards adults, save for the original film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). But even that is quite cheesy in retrospect.
A genuinely adult-themed Ninja Turtles reboot, whether it’s on the big screen or the small screen, would definitely need to take a page out of the comic books, whether it’s the original run from Mirage Studios in the ’80s, or “The Last Ronin”.

“The Last Ronin” takes place in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City, where an older Michelangelo embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter.
A second series titled “Lost Years” (2023) is currently available, and it was announced at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con that a third series titled “Re-Evolution” is in the works, with the first issue available from December. The Last Ronin game is also now in development.

Recently, in an interview with ComicBook.com, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman commented on the possibility of a movie adaptation of “The Last Ronin”, while also sharing some details about The Last Ronin game.
Here are his full comments:
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take ‘The Last Ronin’ concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While The Last Ronin game sounds really exciting, unsurprisingly, when it comes to the big screen, Nickelodeon is clearly more focused on building a Mutant Mayhem shared universe. Not only has a sequel already been greenlit, a 2D animated follow-up series will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.
This isn’t great news for fans hoping for a live-action adaptation of The Last Ronin. Fortunately, The Last Ronin game will remedy some of that disappointment when it’s eventually released.

Either way, the popular comic book series is on the tip of everyone’s tongue, even when it comes to conversations about Mutant Mayhem. In an interview with YouTube channel Nerd Reactor, the brand-new Ninja Turtles actors were asked for their thoughts on “The Last Ronin.” Leonardo actor, Nicolas Cantu, who is clearly a fan of the comic books, was the first to respond, saying, “That is sick! That is sick!”
Brady Noon, who voices Raphael in the film, said to the interviewer, “You are the first person who has mentioned ‘The Last Ronin’!” before asking his co-stars, “Did you see the YouTube thing for it?”, referring to the popular fan film that imagines what a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” might look like.

The interviewer then put a question to Shamon Brown Jr. who voices Michelangelo, saying, “Let’s say, in the future, people love this [Mutant Mayhem], the reception is well, and people are like, ‘Oh man I want to see older Mikey deal with [the death of his brothers!'”
Here’s what the actor said in response: “I would be open to that, for sure. You know the voice gets deeper a little bit and, you know, has to get a bit more gruesome, but it’s going to be amazing. Hey, we’ll see. It could be five to ten years from now, you never know.”
“Are you going to miss us?” Cantu jokingly asked his co-star. “Cuz we’re gone in that storyline!”
While Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael are indeed dead at the time “The Last Ronin” takes place, they still appear in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, so there would certainly be room for Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey (Donatello) to appear alongside Shamon Brown Jr. They’d just need to be considerably older first.
Check out the interview below:
Even if The Last Ronin movie does eventually happen, it’s unlikely any of the Mutant Mayhem actors will ever end up reprising their roles, as Nickelodeon would likely want to keep the film as far from the Mutant Mayhem universe as possible. But who knows. One day, we could get a CG-animated Last Ronin movie as part of the “Mutant Mayhem-verse.”
Either way, who else could take on the role?
Who could play Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie?
Keanu Reeves
Keanu Reeves is no stranger to the martial arts, or taking down hordes of bad guys in neon-lit city settings as he sets out to exact vengeance upon a powerful enemy. If you’ve seen the John Wick films, you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Reeves’ gruff and somber voice would also be perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie.
Michael Shannon
Michael Shannon plays General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) and The Flash (2023), so he has plenty of experience with movies based on comic books. But it’s his role as Mr. Green in the comedy film The Night Before (2015) that oozes those “chilled out” Michelangelo vibes. More importantly, Shannon would bring a ton of grit to the role in The Last Ronin movie.
Chris Hemsworth
Chris Hemsworth also has experience with comic book movies as the God of Thunder, Thor, but we’re looking at his role as Tyler Rake in the Extraction films. Hemsworth also has the physique perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, and he’s also a great comedy actor, which would allow for the more “traditional” Mikey to surface from time to time.
Andy Serkis
Andy Serkis might not be the first actor you think of when casting a character like Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, or any Turtle for that matter. However, Serkis is the king of motion-capture performance, whether it’s Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, King Kong in Peter Jackson’s 2005 epic, or Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy.
Iko Uwais
Iko Uwais is hardly a household name in these parts of the world, but he might just be the most suited candidate for playing Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie. Uwais is best known for playing Rama in The Raid films, the adrenalin-charged Indonesian actioners. The actor’s mind-blowing fighting skills could prove an absolute game-changer .
Noel Fisher
There’s probably no better actor to play Michelangelo than, well, Michelangelo. It would seem unfair to give the character the motion-capture treatment again without considering Noel Fisher, who portrayed him in the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. The Last Ronin version of Mikey, however, would be very different to what you saw in those films.
These actors could even portray Michelangelo in The Last Ronin game, whether it’s through motion-capture performance or voice work. Unless Mutant Mayhem‘s Shamon Brown Jr. is confident about doing that deeper voice.
While there’s no film based on “The Last Ronin” in development, a trailer for The Last Ronin video game was released on Friday. Check it out below:
There’s no release date for The Last Ronin game. “The Last Ronin” comic books are all on sale now. The third series, “Re-Evolution”, goes on sale in December.
Mutant Mayhem is in theaters now. Check out the trailer below:

The Turtles are back in the animated movie Mutant Mayhem, an origin story where the TMNT have to save New York City from the mutant creature Superfly.
The star-studded movie boasts an impressive cast and crew. It's produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and features the voices of The Bear's Ayo Edebiri, Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito, WWE legend John Cena and Marvel's Paul Rudd.

However, unlike the 1991 arcade version, this one is miniaturised at ¼ scale of the classic arcade cabinet without sacrificing any features. It measures 17.5 inches (44.5 cm) tall and 9.2 inches wide (23.4 cm), with a depth of 9.4 inches (24 cm).
The Turtles in Time mini-arcade offers multiplayer options for up to four people, and the cabinet itself is crafted from real wood. The design and even button combinations mirror the 1991 arcade version.
In Turtles in Time, you can choose to control any of the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they travel through time to battle legendary enemies such as Krang and the Super Shredder. Each level features a boss drawn from either the 1987 cartoon or the 1991 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze.

2023-08-05 00:20:18+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director credits Spider-Verse with opening the door to unique animation,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe credits Spider-Verse with opening the door to unique animation.,"When CG animation began to take hold following the release of Toy Story, there was a period where a lot of the movies looked quite similar. Little by little, the various animation studios added their own stylistic flourishes, but it wasn’t until the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse were it felt like there was a real mainstream departure from the previous style. Since the success of Spider-Verse, we’ve seen more animated movies embrace a unique style, including the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
While speaking with THR, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe credited Spider-Verse with giving them more confidence in their style. “ The first Spider-Verse really opened a lot of doors, ” Rowe said. “ It really made it okay for studios to take chances on a film looking unique and maybe having a little bit more sophistication and emotional maturity in its storytelling. And it was such a seismic shift that it became expected. Suddenly, making movies that look like the style of CG animation over the past 30 years felt dated. And so they really paved the way for what will hopefully be a huge generation of new filmmakers with very unique expressions. “
Jeff Rowe also didn’t want to make a “grounded” Ninja Turtles movie, with dark and gritty versions of the foursome.
There’s been a little bit of a trend with superhero films, and it probably really kicked off with Batman Begins, but it’s to take the preposterous elements of the franchise and the lore and make them black and tactical and grounded and whatever the realistic version is. And so we had thought about that early on, like, “Okay, how would you actually strap a sword to yourself and do these things?” And we were like, “That’s just not the Ninja Turtles. They’re wacky. The designs are silly. That playfulness is what I loved about it as a kid, so let’s embrace that. Let’s be really grounded with New York, and then in an environment like TCRI, let’s make it look like the Technodrome.” It’s a dated, aging technology environment anyway, so it kind of makes sense. And if we found a way to make the Pizza Van make sense, then there’s definitely room to make a Turtle Blimp make sense within our own internal logic.
“ After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts, ” reads the official synopsis for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. “ Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. “

2023-07-31 15:01:18+00:00,"'TMNT' Co-Creator Confirms Disappointing News for ""Last Ronin"" Fans - Inside the Magic","It might be a great week for 'TMNT' fans, but this is bad news.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will likely take theaters by storm over the next few weeks. This year has seen its fair share of blockbusters take a massive slice out of the box office, including Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023). However, it’s animated films that seem to be the dominant force of cinema in 2023.
Across the Spider-Verse (2023) caught $682.4 million on its web and became Sony Pictures Animation’s highest-grossing film, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.355 billion worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing animated films ever.
Needless to say, the CG-animated Mutant Mayhem stands a solid chance at success. The film is also being heavily marketed in a similar fashion to Barbie (minus all the many shades of pink, of course), which echoes “Turtle-Mania” from the early ’90s.
In fact, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures are so confident Mutant Mayhem will turn in a huge profit that they’ve already announced the film is the first installment in a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set to follow the movie on Paramount+ this year.
So it makes sense that Nickelodeon isn’t letting anything stand in the film’s way — not even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
It turns out Nickelodeon is king when it comes to the TMNT property, so much so that they appear to have already stopped another Ninja Turtles reboot from hitting the big screen, likely because it may interfere with the new Mutant Mayhem universe.
That reboot is “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020)…
What is “The Last Ronin”?
“The Last Ronin” is an ongoing comic book series from IDW Publishing, which has been churning out TMNT comic books since 2011. The series follows lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo as he embarks on a one-way revenge mission to take on the man responsible for the deaths of his three brothers in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City.
The series now also has a follow-up titled “Lost Years,” which details the preceding years in which Michelangelo embarks on a quest to become the Last Ronin while, in the present day, introducing four brand-new Ninja Turtles, Odyn, Yin, Moja, and Uno, who are under the tutelage of newly-appointed sensei, Casey Marie Jones.
At this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that “The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution” (2023) will arrive later this year.

Is “The Last Ronin” in a different universe?
“The Last Ronin” takes place in an alternate timeline now dubbed the “Ronin-verse.” However, it’s reasonable to consider that it follows on from the “present-day” IDW material, which is still ongoing.
The Ronin-verse is already expanding in the form of follow-ups such as “Lost Years,” the one-shot comic “Lost Day,” and the upcoming “Re-Evolution,” and also with many collectible action figures. There’s also a “Triple-A” video game in the works, although most fans would prefer a theatrical adaptation.

Will there be a “Last Ronin” movie?
Since it arrived in 2020, TMNT fans have been clamoring for a big-screen adaptation of “The Last Ronin.” In fact, fans have wanted a dark, gritty theatrical outing for well over three years. After all, this is the style and tone in which the Ninja Turtles first started in Mirage Comics, co-created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984.
Unfortunately, it looks like “The Last Ronin” won’t be getting the big screen treatment, or the small screen treatment for that matter — at least not anytime soon.
In an interview with ComicBook.com, Kevin Eastman discussed the fact fans have been hoping for a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” but explained that Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route instead.
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
While Nickelodeon could easily adopt DC’s “Elseworlds” strategy, which isolates films such as Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) from its shared universe installments, it looks like the universe established in Mutant Mayhem is their number one priority.
This may come as very disappointing news for fans of “The Last Ronin,” but there is a short, CG-animated, fan-made film on YouTube worth checking out. And then, of course, there’s the upcoming video game based on the ongoing comic book series.

When is “The Last Ronin” game out?
There’s currently no release date for “The Last Ronin” video game, though we do know it is inspired by the popular God of War video game series.
Earlier this year, Doug Rosen, Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said the game would focus only on Michelangelo. However, he added that Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, who only appear in the comics through hallucinations and flashbacks, may also appear in a playable format in flashback sequences.
Rosen also said that the mature themes of The Last Ronin (TBA) would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be.”

The highly-stylized take on the Ninja Turtles represents the fourth swing at a theatrical franchise and the seventh installment to be released in movie theaters.
Inspired by movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a new generation of ambitious animated movies like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have started to seep into the blockbuster space, giving a cool, tactile update to properties that had previously been fairly by-the-numbers in terms of their style, even when the scripts themselves were strong.
""We wanted it to be like Stand By Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" director Jeff Rowe described. ""They've got a lot of that inauthentic confidence that teenagers have: when you're a teen, you don't know any better, so you operate with this hyped-up sense of, 'We can do anything!' That's something that [they] are great at – that Superbad thing where they're best friends, but they're kinda losers who make fun of each other, but you never doubt for a second that they truly love each other.""

,Post Malone Is Playing a Mutant Sting Ray in TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,"The Dallas music legend has been cast by producer, writer and co-star Seth Rogen as the human manta-ray mutant known as Ray Fillet.","There's a certain hierarchy or ladder that musicians have to climb to achieve the ultra-rare movie star/musician status, and Post Malone is on his way to the top rung.It goes like this: First (and this is the hardest part), you have to become a chart-topping musical megastar. Post Malone has already checked that box with eight diamond singles , surpassing Bruno Mars' record last April, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In fact, he's triple- checked, filled in the box completely and even circled it several times with a red Sharpie. So that's covered.Then you have to go on TV a lot, which is easy to do when you've broken RIAA records and received Grammy nominations and such. You go on late-night shows, reality shows or even comedy shows. Hell, you don't have to do most of the work on that one. They come to you. Posty's done that with shows such as, where he went on a day-drinking trip with the satirical comedian, and more recently, Post Malone helped play pranks on the public on Impractical Jokers Then and only then can you achieve the first step on the path to movie stardom, and Post Malone is a month away from completing that task. He's been cast as one of the many villains in Paramount Pictures' animated comedy adventurepremieringon Aug. 4.The newmovie, written and produced by Seth Rogen, is finally taking pop culture's most famous reptile assassins down the comedy route it desperately needed since Michael Bay took over the franchise. The less said about, the better.Everything from the stop-motion-ish animation style to the cavalcade of characters approach to storytelling brings the Turtles back to their afternoon cartoon roots. The film is basically turning the characters into anotherminus the LEGOS. Instead of just having the Turtles fight their arch nemesis Master Shredder, Rogen and company are throwing pretty much every villain at them. Posty has been cast to play the human-manta ray hybrid Ray Fillet. We even get a little taste of how he might approach the character in this extended trailer.Ray Fillet is one of those characters who didn't get a lot of time in the original cartoon and zero time in the movies. In fact, he's more known for being a mutant in some of thecomic book spinoff series in the 1990s who flirts between friend and enemy from story to story. And he's one of the toy line's most sought-after action figures.According to IGN , Ray is a former marine biologist who got exposed to that pesky mutagen while investigating a toxic waste dump. His DNA fused with a manta ray who happened to be in the vicinity, and you know the rest. It's a tale as old as time, if time started in 1990.Having a character who's not as well known as the brutish Bebop and Rocksteady or Baxter Stockman means Post will have a lot of room to play around with the character and build up a personality for the new movie. In other words, we're about to get a prime dose of mutated Posty that you'll be able to inject directly into your veins come early August. If anybody can play a sing-songy, fighting manta ray, it's Post Malone.The role may already be paying off for Post Malone. According to IMDB, Posty has two more upcoming roles in two separate film productions. He's been cast in an upcoming Christmas comedy calledthat also stars Jack Black and Keegan-Michael Key (and Jack Black better be playing Santa) and as a narrator in a short film calledwhich has something to do with continental drift. He may or may not also be a talking manta ray in the latter.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc29ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9hcnRzL3Bvc3QtbWFsb25lLWlzLXBsYXlpbmctYS12aWxsYWluLWluLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS0xNjkwNTg0N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-11 22:51:17+00:00,Chris Pine has a cameo in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles newest film, Mutant Mayhem, has a blink and you miss it cameo from Chris Pine, well, sorta.","Why did the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds higher ups debut *that* character? by Chad Porto
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem had an unexpected Chris Pine cameo.
The sixth movie from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise premiered on Aug. 2, 2023, and is trending well with critics and fans alike. The new film, entitled, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem features the four titular teenage turtles as such, teenagers, who are lost and unsure about themselves as they move through the world.
It’s a heartfelt story, led by some wonderful voice work from the four young actors playing the titular Ninja Turtles. And while the four main characters were voiced by mostly unknown actors, the film still carries a hefty roster including Jackie Chan, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube, Hannibal Buress, and Paul Rudd.
Yet, despite all the big names that the film brought in to help support the young core cast, the film still found a way to fit in Chris Pine. Well, kinda, sorta.
Star Trek’s Chris Pine makes cameo in Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Pine’s cameo comes unannounced, and rather unexpected because he technically doesn’t appear in the film. In fact, it wasn’t Pine, so much as a cardboard cutout of his Star Trek character, James T. Kirk, which appears.
During a scene where Master Splinter is trying to convince his four teenage turtle sons to stay in the sewers and give up on trying to fit in among the humans, he pulls out three cardboard cutouts of various celebrities. One of those celebrations was in fact Pine as James Kirk.
While surprising to see a “Star Trek character” in the film, it’s not unexpected, as they’re both Paramount properties. Not only did Pine’s Kirk make a brief cameo, but so did the face of Nickelodeon, SpongeBob SquarePants.
The synergy was real in the film, as Paramount tries to bolster its animated offerings going forward. That said, while fans and critics alike have enjoyed the film, it doesn’t appear to be a financial success as it hasn’t even broken even with its budget, let alone the budget plus advertising.
If the TMNT film franchise can’t turn a profit, that will in fact hurt how Paramount views this, and other established animated IPs. Including those offered by Star Trek.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vcmVkc2hpcnRzYWx3YXlzZGllLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzExL2NocmlzLXBpbmUtaGFzLWEtY2FtZW8taW4tdGhlLW5ldy10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Castillo recently shared some of his alternate designs for April O'Neill, and we now have a look at his early artwork for the Heroes in a Half-Shell's wise mentor/father, Splinter.
Unlike the April designs, these don't look much different to the version of Splinter we saw in the movie (those somewhat unsettling x-ray-style sketches are simply to illustrate his facial structure), but the animated reboot's take on the character was quite a departure.
Generally depicted as a calm, extremely skilled sensei, Splinter was reimagined as a lonely, overly-concerned dad who longs for someone to share his life with. It works for this take on the TMNT, but some long-time fans have taken issue with this and certain other changes to the ""established"" lore.
Spoilers follow.
At the end of the movie, Splinter does find that special someone in the form of... Scumbug!

“TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) made waves when it first arrived back in 2020, becoming a critical and financial hit, storming to the top of The New York Times best-sellers list, and transforming the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise forever.
The story finds the lone surviving Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo, embarking on a one-way mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter, in a futuristic and dystopian New York City.
Related: “Footage” Surfaces For R-Rated ‘TMNT’ Reboot, Marvel Star Was Set For Lead Role
Now, fans are poring over the second, five-part series “The Lost Years” (2023), the prequel/sequel to “The Last Ronin”, which expands upon “the lost years” that precede Michelangelo’s long-awaited return to New York, while also introducing the Turtles’ “replacements.”
The end of the first series sees Michelangelo successfully avenge the deaths of his three brothers after a bloody battle against New York City dictator Oroku Hiroto (The Shredder’s grandson). However, he is also fatally wounded in the fight.

But the final scene reveals that April O’Neil’s daughter, Casey Marie, a pivotal figure in the rebellion against Oroku Hiroto, has started to raise four baby mutant turtles in the original Ninja Turtles’ sewer lair, and this is where “The Lost Years” picks up.
It would be a lie to say that the current series is split halfway down the middle where its prequel/sequel commitments are concerned. Any focus on the four new turtles, Odyn, Moja, Yi, and Uno, is limited to only a handful of panels in each issue.
Related: Will the Live-Action ‘Ninja Turtles’ Reboot Be All-Female?!
But this isn’t a criticism — undoubtedly, the creators are drip-feeding these new characters into our lives without shifting the focus from Michelangelo entirely. The last original Ninja Turtle will most likely be gone forever once this series ends.
Each issue leaps forward three years, so by the time we arrive at Issue #4, the new turtles are, as the story describes, “pre-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But unlike the previous three issues, they’re now finally being trained on how to fight by their sensei, Casey Marie.

While their scene in the latest TMNT installment is just as fleeting as those in previous issues, it’s great to finally see them in action, even if the fight does turn out to be nothing more than a simulation, with Casey preparing them for the real world above.
It’s also likely that the final issue, which releases in late July, will feature more from them, which makes sense given that “The Lost Day,” a one-shot comic that hits shelves in late August, will follow these them in their entirety, as they officially replace the original Ninja Turtles.

IDW Publishing’s main “TMNT” comic book series is still ongoing. At the same time “The Last Ronin,” which takes place in an alternate timeline, is also set to continue, as co-creator Kevin Eastman previously confirmed that a third series is already in development.
But while the primary canon will continue, it seems fans are far more interested in “The Last Ronin.” Not only are waves of new toys based on the dark and gritty comic book series hitting shelves, but a brand-new “AAA game” is in the works, which is said to be heavily inspired by the Gods of War game series.
As per IDW, here’s the synopsis for “The Last Ronin — Lost Years”:
RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In the smash-hit miniseries TMNT: The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time — past, present, future — to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half Shell. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heart-breaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artist Ben Bishop (TMNT: The Last Ronin) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of… Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

2023-08-05 15:28:37+00:00,"Movie review: ‘Mutant Mayhem’ a fresh, authentic take on the ninja turtles","The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.","Radioactive ooze generated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” has helped birth “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the new animated feature about everyone’s favorite rambunctious, pizza-loving reptiles. Directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears showcase the turtles in a way we’ve never seen them before, utilizing a blend of 3D and 2D animation to create a unique, rough-hewn (on purpose) style that suggests children’s book illustrations blended with teenage sketchbooks.
That edgy look is paired with a script that’s funny and fresh, a soundtrack filled with classic New York hip-hop, and a stunning industrial score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
It’s clear that Rowe, Spears and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (who also produced the film), Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit and Brendan O’Brien, have a deep love and nostalgia for these lovable ‘80s relics, who were ubiquitous in the childhoods of older millennials. These sewer-dwelling rapscallions, raised and trained by a rat named Splinter, were born on the pages of a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. There were toys, a memorable Saturday morning cartoon, and three live-action movies back in the 1990s (who could forget the refrain sung by Vanilla Ice: “go ninja, go ninja, go!”). But the less said about the film adaptations in the 2010s, the better.
‘Mutant Mayhem’ is both a new direction for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a return to the past, symbolically, locating the material in the land of teenage imagination, memory, nostalgia and emotion. The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.
The color palette is dark with pops of neon, giving it an early ‘90s look. Sprinkled throughout are video clips that nod to the cultural touchstones of the creators: snippets of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” a salute to John Hughes, to whose vision of American high school the teen turtles cling, and instructional karate training videos, which is how Splinter (Jackie Chan) teaches his young turtle sons to defend themselves against the terrifying outside world.
The creators get back to basics with the story, focusing on the question of fathers and sons, mutants existing within humanity and the universal desire for acceptance. Splinter, a New York City street rat, is already inured to human rejection when he adopts the four adorable turtles covered in radioactive ooze. He raises them in a loving environment, away from the hustle and bustle (and malice) of the city, and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), grow up in a tight-knit quartet, though they long to be part of the world.
On the other hand is supervillain Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who doesn’t hide from humanity, but harbors genocidal impulses toward the people who have deemed his and his mutant brethren unacceptable. He wants to make every creature on earth a mutant, tipping the balance of power away from the humans and toward the mutants, believing it the only way they’ll find their place in the world.
With the help of intrepid reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the turtles decide to stop Superfly in the hopes that if they’re seen as heroes, they’ll be celebrated and integrated into society in order to fulfill their dream of going to high school (they’re teenagers, they’ve got teenage dreams).
The themes are broad and universal but the writing is remarkable — the dialogue feels natural and authentic to the age group, and it’s filled with modern slang and references to pop culture, rap songs, anime, comedy and more. Their desire for community is a resonant message, but it’s expressed in layered dialogue that feels like the way real teens talk to each other, and it’s beautifully performed by the four actors voicing the turtles.
The filmmakers manage to balance the contemporary feel of the writing and innovative visual style with their own nostalgia for childhood cultural touchstones, which makes “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a fascinating and highly entertaining blend of old and new.

2023-07-03 14:46:44+00:00,"""New Turtles"" Teaser Finally Reveals Two Characters Now Portrayed by Female Actors - Inside the Magic",The new 'Turtles' teaser offers a glimpse of two characters who are now female.,"The “New Turtles” teaser finally reveals two characters now portrayed by female actors.
It’s no stretch to say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has always been a diverse franchise. 1997 saw the first female Turtle, Venus de Milo, in the live-action television series Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (1997).
Since then, there have been even more female Turtles in the long-running IDW Publishing comic book series, from human-turned-Turtle Jennika to the more recent Moja and Yi, who form part of the new line-up in the ongoing “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) series.

Now, the CG-animated reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is set to be just as diverse. Not only is April O’Neil portrayed as African-American (voiced by African-American actress Ayo Edebiri), two TMNT villains are portrayed by female actors.
Those villains are mutant alligator Leatherhead and alien-in-human-form Cynthia Utrom, voiced by Bridesmaids (2011) duo Rose Byrne and Maya Rudolph, respectively. The long-standing character of Leatherhead has previously been portrayed as male in the many TMNT iterations, while Cynthia Utrom appears to be a version of the male villain Krang.

Now, we finally have our first look at both of these characters in a new promotional video titled “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — The New Turtles,” in which producer Seth Rogen name-drops all the film’s characters and the actors who play them.

While we only see a still image of Cynthia Utrom (which is part of a series of newly revealed character posters for the film), we see Leatherhead in action, with Rose Byrne’s native Aussie accent, as she says, “G’day, fellas!”
These villains might not be anywhere near as iconic as the likes of Bebop and Rocksteady (who are voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena in the upcoming film), but between this new change-up and the two new female Turtles in “The Last Ronin,” we could end up with an all-female TMNT movie one day.

,Seth Rogen Talks Remaking 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Starring Actual Teenagers (Exclusive),'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' hits theaters on Aug. 2.,"Everyone's favorite sewer-dwelling, pizza-gobbling, crime-fighting reptiles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, but this time there's one major difference -- the titular turtles are actually played by teenagers!
""They're often middle-aged men doing Teenage-Voiced Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" joked Seth Rogen when he sat down with ET's Will Marfuggi to talk about how a life-long love of the titular turtles led to writing and producing the latest installment in the long-running franchise.
""I was really the target audience for the first iteration of all this stuff,"" he explained, noting that he watched the TMNT cartoons and movies as a kid and was ""obsessed"" with the toys. ""My dad bought like, a big box of used Ninja Turtle toys at a garage sale when I was a kid, and so I had those and I played with them so much.""
However, Rogen admitted, ""I always thought that the 'Teenage' part of it was weirdly under-explored, you know?""
For his movie, the Dumb Money star added in more details about the turtles' desire to be just regular teens, and wanted the cast to be made up of voice actors that were closer in age to their characters than past iterations.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star Brady Noon, 17, is Raphael, the bravest and strongest -- but also most impulsive -- of his brothers, who wears a red mask and fights with two pronged sai weapons.
Paramount Pictures
The Amazing World of Gumball's Nicolas Cantu, 19, plays Leonardo, ""the leader and the most honorable and responsible"" of the turtles, who wears blue and wields two katana.
Paramount Pictures
Cousins for Life star Micah Abbey, 15, plays the ""wise and resourceful"" Donatello, who wears a purple mask and wields a bō staff.
Paramount Pictures
And The Chi's Shamon Brown Jr., 19, is Michelangelo, the heart and charismatic soul of the family. ""Mikey,"" as his brothers call him, dons an orange mask and primarily fights with nunchucks, though he's wielded other weapons throughout the years.
Paramount Pictures
""It's always [been] the same kind of energy, from the beginning,"" Brown Jr. said of stepping into a beloved role that multiple actors have played throughout the years. ""Mikey, personally, being like the funny one and you know, the loving one, I kind of embodied that in to this, just [adding] the modern day feel to it.""
Part of that modern feel, Rogen admitted, came from letting the core foursome improvise and inject some modern-day teen speak to make up for the old, outdated ""cowabungas"" -- which would feel totally anachronistic in 2023.
""I think it was so important that the freedom that Jeff [Rowe, Mutant Mayhem director] and Seth gave us and kind of the trust that they put into us being like, 'I think these kids know the generation better then we do as older men,'"" Noon shared, earning a guffaw from Rogen. ""I think that that was really important that we just had that trust and [knew] certain slangs that we can put into the film to make it better understanding for our generation.""
""Most of it was just Seth and Jeff giving us like, the reins to be crazy,"" Cantu agreed, recalling that Rogen and Rowe would often hear the boys joking around off-camera and ask them to recreate the dialogue in the booth.
""We cast them well and we just knew if they were essentially themselves, honestly, that it would convey the right dynamic and it would be the right energy,"" Rogen noted. ""That was like so helpful and it's why the movie feels natural, and I think why you stop thinking of them as turtles and you start thinking of them as teenagers within like, 30 seconds of seeing them on screen.""
For Rogen, it was an exercise in feeling a bit out of his depth as a writer.
""A large part of it was acknowledging, like, I don't know how these kids talk anymore,"" he admitted. ""When we wrote Superbad, we had such a handle of how 18-year-olds in 2004 spoke, you know what I mean? But now it's like 20 years later... We don't want to sound like 40-year-old men writing for teenagers.""
""I don't know half the stuff they say in the movie,"" he joked, teasing the cast, ""I signed off on it. I've heard since that it's really offensive.""
The film also stars Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rogen as Bebop, John Cena as Rocksteady, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito and Maya Rudolph.

But there are still plenty of intriguing new releases in August, from a reboot of a beloved '80s property to a pair of raunchy comedies that could make for your next great double feature.
""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (Aug. 2)
Cowabunga! The ninja turtles are back for their first animated movie in more than 15 years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" following two live-action Michael Bay films. ""After years of being sheltered from the human world,"" the turtles set out to ""win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,"" per Paramount. Seth Rogen worked on the screenplay and voices Bebop, and the rest of the voice cast includes John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The turtles also have a new look, as the film's art style is reminiscent of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" With great turtle power comes great turtle responsibility.
""Meg 2: The Trench"" (Aug. 4)
What better way to close out the summer than with a big, dumb shark movie? Jason Statham returns in this sequel to ""The Meg,"" the 2018 surprise hit that saw him gloriously face off against a megalodon shark. This time, he and Wu Jing ""lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean,"" which ""spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival,"" per Warner Bros. It's based on the follow-up to the original novel, and the screenwriters from the first movie are back, though there's a new director: Ben Wheatley, the filmmaker known for disturbing horror movies like ""Kill List."" Hopefully, the sequel hasn't bitten off more than it can chew.
""Shortcomings"" (Aug. 4)
Randall Park has long been a delightful on-screen presence, but he's now ready to get behind the camera. Variety described Park's new dramedy ""Shortcomings"" as a ""fresh-faced, funny directorial debut"" for the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" star. From Sony Pictures Classics, the movie follows a struggling filmmaker, Ben (Justin H. Min), and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), who works for an Asian American film festival. ""When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want,"" the synopsis says. Sherry Cola stars as Ben's best friend Alice. Sony also described Ben as a man who ""spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women"" and ""watching Criterion Collection DVDs."" Wait, is this play about us?
""Heart of Stone"" (Aug. 11)
Gal Gadot's future as Wonder Woman may be in doubt, but if that gig falls through, at least she's got a home in the Netflix ecosystem. After starring in the streamer's ""Red Notice,"" Gadot returns for another Netflix original film that she also produced, the spy thriller ""Heart of Stone,"" in which she plays secret agent Rachel Stone. She's the ""only intelligence operative who stands between her global, peace-keeping organization and the loss of its most valuable — and dangerous — asset, codenamed: The Heart,"" per Netflix. Jamie Dornan also stars. Director Tom Harper told Entertainment Weekly the aim is for the film to spawn a new female-led action series like James Bond. In its attempt to craft more original franchises, Netflix is leaving no stone unturned.
""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" (Aug. 11)
If ""Renfield"" got you in the mood for more Dracula on the big screen, Universal has another movie for you. From ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" director André Øvredal, ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is based on a chapter from the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" novel, ""The Captain's Log,"" in which Dracula travels on board a merchant ship and things don't end well for those aboard. ""Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship,"" per Universal. Think of it as ""Alien,"" but on a boat and with Dracula instead of a Xenomorph. Corey Hawkins and Liam Cunningham star, and Javier Botet plays Dracula. With their help, for now, the Universal monsters franchise is alive.
""Gran Turismo"" (Aug. 11)
The race to find the next great video game movie is shifting gears with ""Gran Turismo."" David Harbour and Orlando Bloom star in this film based on the popular racing video games, though it's not a direct adaptation of them. Instead, it's inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, who became an actual race car driver after playing the video game competitively. The stakes are high for director Neill Blomkamp, who has struggled to follow up his critically-acclaimed debut film, 2009's ""District 9;"" his last two movies, ""Chappie"" and ""Demonic,"" were both widely panned. Can bringing a racing game to the big screen get his career back on track?
""Blue Beetle"" (Aug. 18)
The end of the DC universe as we know it is in sight, but it's not quite over yet. The DC Extended Universe still has two more films left before new boss James Gunn reboots the franchise. First up is ""Blue Beetle,"" in which a young college graduate, played by Xolo Maridueña, ""unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,"" which ""chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host,"" leading him to become the superhero Blue Beetle, per Warner Bros. Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first character of the new DC universe, suggesting he could stick around even after the upcoming reboot. But that likely depends on how well this film performs, as if it's another DC bomb, expect the character to be tossed aside as quickly as Ezra Miller's Flash.
""Strays"" (Aug. 18)
In June, Jennifer Lawrence did her part to keep comedies alive in theaters with ""No Hard Feelings,"" and ""Strays"" is now picking up the torch. This new comedy produced by ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller has a unique hook: it's a filthy, R-rated film starring a bunch of talking dogs. The pups ""hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie,"" a Border Terrier voiced by Will Ferrell, ""find his way home"" and make his ""lowlife owner"" pay for abandoning him. Jamie Foxx and Will Forte also flesh out the voice cast, and Dennis Quaid appears in the movie as himself. Will this barking dog comedy have bite?
""Bottoms"" (Aug. 25)
Two of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood today are Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri, but fans introduced to them though ""Shiva Baby"" and ""The Bear"" may not realize the two collaborated in 2020 on the digital shorts ""Ayo and Rachel Are Single."" Three years later, they're teaming back up for the raunchy sex comedy ""Bottoms,"" in which two girls ""start a fight club as a way to lose their virginities to cheerleaders,"" per MGM. Emma Seligman directed the film in her follow-up to ""Shiva Baby,"" and Sennott co-wrote it with Seligman. Marshawn Lynch also stars. The movie earned near universal acclaim at South by Southwest, with Mashable's Kristy Puchko calling it a ""ruthless and hysterical parody of the teen sex comedy."" This is one fight club everyone will be talking about.
""Retribution"" (Aug. 25)
We've got five words for you: ""Speed,"" but with Liam Neeson. If you're not already on board, you should be. The actor leads this new action-thriller in which a man receives a call from a mysterious person who tells him there's a bomb under his car seat. The caller demands he ""complete a specific series of tasks,"" and with ""his kids trapped in the back seat and a bomb that will explode if they get out of the car, a normal commute becomes a twisted game of life or death,"" per Lionsgate. Nimród Antal, the filmmaker behind 2010's ""Predators,"" directs, and Jack Champion and Matthew Modine also star. Following new blockbusters starring Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, it's the perfect conclusion to the summer of aging action stars proving they've still got it.

Talk to Me (15) ***
A brash summer raunch-fest in The Hangover/Bridesmaids mould, Joy Ride sees Crazy Rich Asians co-writer Adele Lim make her directorial debut with a furiously funny Asian-American road trip comedy about cultural identity, familial estrangement and the wisdom of getting a vaginal tattoo. Ashley Park stars as Audrey, a super-capable Seattle lawyer whose imminent promotion depends on closing a deal in China, a country she hasn’t returned to since being adopted as a baby by a white American family. Going along for the ride, and to help with translation, is her best friend Lolo (comic Sherry Cola), a penniless maker of sexually provocative art who’s been Audrey’s best friend since they were kids.
The film swiftly and hilariously establishes their symbiotic relationship with a playground-set prologue – and just as quickly disrupts it, first by having them forced to chaperone Lolo’s socially awkward cousin, Deadeye (Sabrina Wu), as she makes her own pilgrimage to China to visit relatives, then by amplify Lolo’s own insecurities by having them hook-up with Audrey’s hard-partying college best friend Kat, now an actress in a hit martial arts show and about to marry her hunky Christian co-star, who knows nothing of her somewhat salacious past.

Played by Everything Everywhere All At Once’s Stephanie Hsu, Kat is the owner of the aforementioned tattoo, which later becomes the source of a raucous musical set-piece and a brilliant gag involving an old Looney Tunes character. But the culture-clashing comedy is really set in motion when the businessman Audrey is in Shanghai to impress takes a dim view of her lack of awareness of her own heritage, prompting her to seek out her birth mother. High jinks involving copious drug consumption and sexual encounters with a basketball team follow, as do wry potshots at virtue-signalling misogynists, racist relatives and internalised bigotry, all of it delivered with real comic brio by a confident, up-for-anything cast whose collective ability to make you care for their characters ensures the more thoughtful turn the film takes in its final act feels earned. This is a film that lives up to its title.

That one of the funnier throwaway gags in Joy Ride involves a sexual fantasy about Splinter, the sewer-rat ninja father of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, turns out be a cheeky bit of cross-promotion from Joy Ride’s producers Seth Rogen and Evan Handler, who are also the co-producers and co-writers of the new TMNT reboot. Sadly, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is an oddly muted return for the heroes in a half-shell. After three live-action films in the 1990s and two unloved Michael Bay-produced reboots in the 2010s, the new film goes the animated route, borrowing the beautiful hand-painted aesthetics of the recent Spider-Verse films, which is striking for a little while, but the script’s efforts to re-establish the pizza-loving TMNT’s relevance falls flat with dated references to Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and shout-outs to Beyoncé, Batman and the Avengers. There’s none of the ribald humour of Rogen and Handler’s modern teen classic Superbad either, and the origins-story plot simply re-cycles the first X-Men movie.

The aftermath of a Bataclan-style terrorist attack is the subject of Paris Memories, the latest film from Proxima director Alice Winocour. Inspired by her own brother’s experiences of being caught up in the aforementioned 2015 night club attack, her film takes a sensitive, deeply humane approach to tragedy by zeroing in on Mia (Virginie Efire), the survivor of a gun attack on a cafe. Shattering life as she’s known it, the massacre – which Winocour films from Mia’s point of view as she throws herself to the floor before blacking out – becomes a fractured event in her own mind, the trauma erasing any certainty about what happened and how she survived. The bulk of the film revolves around Mia’s efforts to reconstruct the night in question, first by joining a support group for fellow survivors, then by trying to track down an undocumented kitchen worker she vaguely remembers from the shooting. Here, Winocour slyly turns the film into a detective story, one in which her protagonist isn’t so much trying to find her place in a city forever transformed by a terrible event, but her place in a city in which a terrible event has shattered some of its romantic illusions, revealing a deeper, richer, more complex reality that’s been there all along.

Entertainingly slick, if never exactly scary, the hip new Australian horror offering Talk to Me serves up a nifty riff on the ouija board party games of horror movies past by replacing this portal to the spirit world with the embalmed severed hand of a vengeful medium. Encased in porcelain, said hand is now the source of a social media-fuelled game in which suburban teens encourage their friends to hold it and utter the titutlar phrase “Talk to Me” while subjecting themselves to the merciless glare of their friends’ live-streaming smart phones as they endure an apparently terrifying brief encounter with the afterlife.

As none of these kids appear to have seen a horror film from the last 50 years, there’s no shortage of volunteers; mercifully debut directors Danny and Michael Phillippou cut quickly to the chase with some inventively rendered shocks and offset the premise’s inherent silliness by grounding their main character Mia's decision to participate in the game in the trauma of her own mother’s suicide (Mia is nicely played by Sophie Wilde). Though the resulting film owes much to the like of Flatliners and the Evil Dead, it’s a solid launch pad for the Phillippou brothers.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vYXJ0cy1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS9maWxtLWFuZC10di9maWxtLXJldmlld3Mtam95LXJpZGUtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXBhcmlzLW1lbW9yaWVzLXRhbGstdG8tbWUtNDI0MDA3MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

As Peter (Chris Pratt), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dave Bautista), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Rocket, and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) nestle into their newly settled life in Knowhere, their calm everyday is brutally bulldozed when a stranger, Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), comes crashing in with the intent to kidnap Rocket.

And then, as teased in the trailer, comes the megalodon, with jaws so big it makes that massive dinosaur into a snack.This is why we go to movies like The Meg."" — K.P.

Untold: Jake Paul the Problem Child

Credit: Netflix

The YouTuber-to-""pro-boxer"" pipeline is by far one of the strangest, yet weirdly intriguing, phenomenon to take over the internet, and now we all get to watch a documentary about it. Netflix's Untold: Jake Paul the Problem Child follows famed former YouTuber Jake Paul as he explains his journey from online sensation to self-proclaimed professional boxer, including his various online controversies . Jake Paul has also faced multiple sexual assault allegations.

What we thought: ""Through interviews with coaches, challengers, supporters, and Paul's own family, the doc paints a flattering portrait of Paul as a scrappy newcomer reviving the sport while challenging its old guard. Those interviews also reveal new information about Paul's struggle to mediate his father's mental and physical abuse and, instead of confronting them, dangerously frames Paul's boxing obsession as a healthy way to channel his repressed trauma into a kind of productive — and lucrative — violence."" — Elizabeth de Luna, Culture Reporter

It is an unfortunate fact that Hollywood is very risk-averse, particularly when it comes to animation. For years, the big studios would make rather formulaic films and try to replicate the success of anything that popped, from Disney and their musicals to DreamWorks and comedies with pop culture references a la ""Shrek."" After the brief moment in the late '90s and early '00s when ambitious sci-fi adventure epics like ""Atlantis"" and ""Titan A.E."" failed financially, all studios started doing visually similar 3D CG movies.

That all changed, of course, when ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" came out. Not that there weren't other movies trying different things, of course. ""The Peanuts Movie"" also delivered stunning 3D visuals with 2D textures, while ""Rango"" delivered photo-realistic animation on a level not even Disney was doing, inside a rather mature Western adventure. And yet not many people saw either of these, and neither received the level of commercial, critical, or awards success ""Spider-Verse"" received.

Since 2018, more studios have experimented with the art form, delivering visually inventive films like ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines,"" or ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,"" the latter of which also delivered a far more mature movie with higher stakes than any other DreamWorks movie at the time, with inventive visuals that deviate from the ""perfect"" CGI animation that audiences have become used to. It's not that they were trying to replicate ""Spider-Verse,"" it was that Miles Morales' tale opened the door and proved you could deviate from the norm and be successful.

The latest film to follow in these footsteps is ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" which debuted a work-in-progress cut at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival earlier this month to tremendous applause.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMyMDA5Ny9hY3Jvc3MtdGhlLXNwaWRlci12ZXJzZS1zdWNjZXNzLWhlbHBlZC10bW50LW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Can movie theaters sustain the 'Barbie boost'?,"Going to the movies is hot again thanks to the so-called ""Barbie boost."" “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and other movies continue to rev up the summer box office. But can theaters sustain the momentum?","The marquee at The Grove theater in Los Angeles announces the opening of Barbie in July 2023. Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images

Going to the movies is hot again. Well, sometimes the point of going is to get out of the heat. But with “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” still attracting audiences — and such newer releases as “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Meg 2: The Trench” selling well — the summer box office is booming. The question is whether cinemas can sustain the momentum.

The global box office hit $4.54 billion in July. According to Gower Street Analytics, it's ""the single highest grossing month since before the pandemic began.""

On a recent Friday afternoon, plenty of women were out to see “Barbie” at the Regal in Silver Spring, Md., including three friends, Elia Safir, Maya Peak and Sarah Krekel.

""None of us own any pink so we all had to borrow from other people,"" laughed Safir.

The three 20-year-olds say they usually watch movies at home on one of the streaming services. Peak, who has now seen “Barbie” twice, thinks she might see more movies in theaters, if studios, ""could replicate something where it's more of an event for us all to go. That would be really cool. Y'know you can't get that just sitting at home.""

Some theaters have life-size Barbie boxes for photo-ops, pink Corvette-shaped popcorn buckets and pink drinks.

""We've sold 7,000 frosés or something like that,"" jokes theater owner Paul Brown, ""I can't keep the rosé on the shelf.""

Brown owns the Terrace Theater in Charleston, S.C. He says “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are fueling the box office, but other movies are also doing well.

""We have “Meg,” which is very popular because we live in a beach town where there's a bunch of sharks,"" he laughs, ""and we have “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” because there's a dearth of good children's movies out. So that's bringing in an audience — and also bringing in an older set that sort of grew up with that brand.""

It appears to be a summer where there's something for everyone at the box office. Still, the competition for people's leisure time is fierce. Theaters have had to adjust to all kinds of challenges over the decades: big screens in people's homes, must-watch TV series, and, most debilitating of all, the COVID-19 shutdown.

""The history of the theater business is one of resilience,"" says Michael O'Leary, President & CEO at the National Association of Theatre Owners. He notes that critics have predicted the ""demise"" of cinemas before.

""Obviously having a global pandemic where the government basically told you you could not operate, that's an unprecedented challenge,"" he says, ""But even in that context, you saw the industry pull together and move forward."" Only about 5 percent of theaters closed during the pandemic.

Now, they're facing the writers and actors strikes.

Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, says the prolonged strikes could disrupt the pipeline of movies.

""Where this becomes very problematic is over the long term. If you don't have actors and writers, you don't have movies in the box office. And movie theaters need movies to sustain their business,"" he says matter-of-factly.

For theaters to thrive as they are this summer, everybody needs to work together, says Dergarabedian.

""When you look at “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” for example, that situation was born out of everything firing on all cylinders, meaning when the actors are working, when the writers are working, when the studios are doing their marketing plans and executing them well, great release dates for movies and an audience willing to go to the movie theater ... when it all works, you get 'Barbenheimer.' When the system breaks down, then it's tougher,"" he says.

Even when everyone is ""firing on all cylinders,"" it's not a guarantee of box office success. For Paul Brown, there's something else theaters like his need to sustain this momentum: quality and creativity.

“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” ""are good, original movies,"" he says, ""They're not based on comic books. For our audience, we'll do OK with the Marvels. But there's a fatigue out there for that kind of stuff, if you ask me.""

Brown says he'll keep showing “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” for as long as the economics make sense.

2023-07-15 20:58:16+00:00,Disney Faces Potential Big Losses at 2023 Oscars - Inside the Magic,"With so many other contenders this year, could Disney lose the 2023 Oscar nom for the second year in a row?","This year has been another great year for animated films, and that’s bad news for Disney.

Commenters online have been talking about the high-quality animated movies this year and how Disney may lose out on yet another Oscar win for the second year in a row. Disney and Pixar have been industry favorites for decades when it comes to the animated feature category. In the 21 years of the category’s history, Disney or Pixar has won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature 15 times. In 2022, the award went to Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, who developed the movie with Netflix Animation and won over other well-received films, including Pixar’s Turning Red.

This year the competition for the best-animated feature is very stiff. Sony Animation’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has dominated the box office since its release and is already set to make over $650 million as of this writing. Other strong contenders include Netflix’s Nimona, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken, and the upcoming Seth Rogan-produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Overseas, fans of Japanese animation have raved over Suzume, whose director made the highly acclaimed Your Name in 2016, and expectations are high for Hayao Miyazaki’s upcoming film The Boy and the Heron, both of which are also strong candidates for the Oscars this year.

However, Disney and Pixar both have a chance of reclaiming the title with Wish and Elemental. Pixar may have been disappointed with Elemental’s performance upon release considering it had the second-lowest box office debut just above the original Toy Story (1995). However, since then the movie has gone on to become Disney’s highest-grossing animated film since Frozen 2 (2019). Wish is still months away so viewers will have to wait until November to see if Disney’s newest movie is better than the competition.

The current state of animation seems to be entering a new golden age. Many point to groundbreaking animation styling from movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and Puss and Boots: The Last Wish (2022). Boundaries are being pushed and animation studios are constantly looking for new ways for animation to feel fresh and exciting rather than just “realistic”. This feeling seems to be extending globally as animation from every corner of the world seeks to present itself in new and unique ways.

Miyazaki, a household name in animation even for those not from Japan, is releasing his newest movie The Boy and the Heron with no marketing or information besides a single poster; allowing the film to speak for itself with no prior bias from the viewer. While Disney has always been a pillar in the animation community it may need to take a close look at itself before it is left behind in the story books of years past.

What do you think about the stiff competition in animation this year?

The company behind animated movies like Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, PAW Patrol: The Movie, and the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will be cutting back on non-IP theatrical animated films. CEO Brian Robbins recently overhauled the Paramount animation division and moved Under the Boardwalk, an animated movie about hermit crabs on Jersey Shore, to an exclusive Paramount+ release.

“We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,” he says.

Robbins wants their theatrical animated slate to be more based in familiar properties, like PAW Patrol, SpongeBob Squarepants, and Avatar: The Last Airbender, all of which have new movies coming out. Robbins believes they will appeal to the millennials who grew up with the shows.

“It’s not about Disney and Pixar anymore,” he says, noting the commercial underperformance of recent Pixar movies like Elemental and Lightyear. “People are looking for animated movies that are irreverent and have a comedic point of view.”

What is the next Paramount movie?

Paramount Pictures is releasing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. It arrives in theaters on August 2, 2023.

Let’s not forget Dan Harmon’s new show “Krapopolis” either.

Or an appearance from legendary “Sin City” and “Daredevil” artist Frank Miller.

What we’re most excited about though is the news set to come out from the Con about “Good Burger 2” starring Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell and Lil Rel Howery.

The oversized pizza is an XXL (16 inches) sized pie that comes as six gigantic slices instead of the standard 12.

It’s so large that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feature the exact pizza in their latest film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

Available in Margarita and Pepperoni flavours or ‘create your own’ with any two toppings at selected Pizza Hut stores for dine-in, delivery at £15.99 and collection for £13.99.

To authentically eat like a New Yorker, fold at the crust or stick to your table manners and use a knife and fork. Pizza Hut has released specially designed pizza boxes for The Big New Yorker orders. The special boxes feature artwork of various Ninja Turtle character illustrations.

,"TMNT Mutant Mayhem 2 release date speculation, cast, plot, and news","We loved the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, and we hope to be back with the heroes in a half shell very soon for the Mutant Mayhem 2 release date.","What is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 release date? The pizza-chomping heroes of the New York City sewers are back, with a joyous and hilarious animated movie co-written by Superbad duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg.

It was a delight to see the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles back on the big screen, and in our Mutant Mayhem review, we wrote that it’s among the best movies of the year. It’s certainly one of the more inventive new movies we’ve seen in 2023, with the success of Spider-Verse clearly paving the way for some very impressive and unorthodox animation from director Jeff Rowe.

We now know that Rowe is returning to the world of the turtles, so we’re ready to start looking ahead to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 release date. There’s another dose of Turtle Power on the way, and we already can’t wait.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 release date speculation

Pencil in summer 2026 for the Mutant Mayhem 2 release date because we think the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will return very soon while the cast is still young.

In our own Jeff Rowe interview, the director hinted that there was more to come for him in this franchise, saying: “I think I still have some miles ahead of me with Turtles to go.” Soon after we spoke to Rowe, the sequel was officially announced, and he’s back in the director’s chair. There will also be a two-season TV series on Paramount Plus in order to bridge the two movies.

As for a timeline, we expect this to get moving as soon as possible. One of the strengths of the first movie is its authentically teenage cast, and given the sequel will want to preserve that, they have to act quickly. However, as animation takes a long time, we still think we’re a few years away.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 cast speculation

We expect the young Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cast to voice the characters again in Mutant Mayhem 2, along with Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil and Jackie Chan as Splinter.

Nicolas Cantu, Shamon Brown Jr, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey were perfect in the first movie as the four turtles, with Jackie Chan doing great work as a put-upon single dad spin on Splinter. They’re all very likely to be back. We also saw the turtles befriend April O’Neil, so Ayo Edebiri is an essential part of any future ensemble.

On the darker side, we’ll almost certainly see more of Maya Rudolph as scientist Cynthia Utrom, and there’s the small matter of casting someone as Shredder. If the big bad is finally here, he’ll have to be flanked by his infamous heavies. That means more work for Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena).

Here is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 cast list:

Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo

Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo

Micah Abbey as Donatello

Brady Noon as Raphael

Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil

Jackie Chan as Splinter

Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom

Seth Rogen as Bebop

John Cena as Rocksteady

What will Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 be about?

Director Jeff Rowe has made it very clear that the iconic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles villain Shredder will be a key part of the Mutant Mayhem 2 plot.

In our interview, Rowe said: “You’ve got to save the best thing for later, like Joker in The Dark Knight. We had Shredder as the villain [in the first movie] early on, and we pivoted away because he’s too much of a presence. He’s such an interesting character.

“It’s so much nicer for an audience to meet the turtles, learn to love the turtles, watch them go on this whole journey, and then you could make like five movies about Shredder. He’s so interesting. Having him in the first movie took up all of the story, and we needed to focus on the turtles.”

So there you go. In the wake of the Mutant Mayhem ending, we expect to explore more of the dark machinations of the Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI), as well as seeing these turtles finally take on Shredder and the Foot Clan.

Is there a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2 trailer?

There’s no trailer, as production hasn’t started on Mutant Mayhem 2 yet, and we think it’ll be a long wait.

However, there’s plenty to enjoy while we wait to know more about the sequel. We’d recommend you delve into this featurette about the unique design of one of the best animated movies we’ve seen in years.

Where can I watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem 2?

We expect Mutant Mayhem 2 to be exclusive to cinemas originally, but there’s also going to be a TV series on Paramount Plus.

We don’t know when that TV show will arrive, but if it’s anything like the movie, it’s going to be one of the best TV series that Paramount has to offer. In the meantime, check out everything new on Paramount Plus for more gems from one of the best streaming services.

2023-08-12 11:43:30+00:00,"Fantasia Festival 2023 review: Femme serves tense, meaningfully murky revenge thrills",,"Sam H. Freeman and Ng Choon Ping’s ‘Femme’, which debuted at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival before making its way to Fantasia, fits the ‘revenge thriller’ glove well. Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), a charismatic and popular drag artist in present-day London, is left physically and emotionally traumatized by a vicious hate crime led by Preston (George MacKay). When Jules encounters Preston in a gay bath-house some months later, the revelation that his attacker is closeted offers the perfect opportunity to enact revenge.

Where ‘Femme’ stands out from the crowd is its boldly intentional refusal to simply deliver straight-forward moral catharsis. Jules’ increasingly intimate relationship with Preston steers the two into a social labyrinth of dangerous, emotionally fraught complications that blur the nature of Jules’ desires.

Stewart-Jarrett and MacKay are phenomenal in their cat-and-mouse roles, evoking ever-shifting levels of empathy and anxiety as their diametrically opposed worlds clash. ‘Femme’ is a nuanced take on concepts of justice, attraction and identity, riding the razor’s edge right until the breath-stealing final act.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWVob2xlLm5ldC9mYW50YXNpYS1mZXN0aXZhbC0yMDIzLXJldmlldy1mZW1tZS1zZXJ2ZXMtdGVuc2UtbWVhbmluZ2Z1bGx5LW11cmt5LXJldmVuZ2UtdGhyaWxscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

A core childhood memory for me and those in my generation was watching Gravity Falls. I still remember the excruciatingly long three-month wait in the middle of the second (and presumably final) season and the similar wait between the penultimate and final episodes of the Disney series.

But the series concluded on February 15, 2016, and has not been reopened in proper form since. Sure, there have been some shorts and one-offs here and there, but the adventures of Dipper and Mabel concluded. Maybe, for once, Disney showed some restraint with the series and didn't let it continue past its welcome (unlike some of their film franchises). They took a very BBC-like approach and ended the series on a high.

Note: This interview was conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike.

Be that as it may, a Gravity Falls continuation of any sort would be amazing. Speaking to former Gravity Falls writer Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs. the Machines and making his feature-length directorial debut with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, he jokingly entertained the idea of a revival.

First, answering the question of whether or not he's thought about a Gravity Falls revival in any capacity, Rowe said, without any hesitation, “Oh yeah.”

Returning to Gravity Falls 30 years later

“I mean, I think my dream — if there was a Gravity Falls [revival] — would be revisiting all of the characters 30 years later in life and just seeing where they're at,” he said with a laugh. “Maybe they all get together at Grunkle Stan's funeral [laughs]. It would be like, it would be like a dramatic [story], [and] it would just be people talking through their emotions and there would be nothing magical about it.”

Would Rowe himself want to direct this dramatic Gravity Falls revival? “100%,” he said without hesitation.

“I'm waiting for Alex [Hirsch] to call me and gimme the keys,” Rowe concluded with a smile.

While it's unlikely that Gravity Falls will come back — let alone in a more serious and dramatic tone with a story revolving around Grunkle Stan's funeral — it's always fun to think about what could be should Alex Hirsch ever decides to bring it back.

According to Variety, Steven Kostanski will follow Psycho Goreman with Frankie Freako, a horror-comedy following a man who allows “a trio of tiny trouble-makers into his home, led by the maniacal rock-n-roll party monster Frankie Freako. It’s a race against time as he must defeat the rambunctious ruffians and clean up their trail of destruction before his wife returns from her weekend work trip, all while going on an unexpected journey of self-discovery.” Conor Sweeney, Adam Brooks and Kristy Wordsworth are attached to star.

I feel really excited to play a villain. I haven’t done that, and it’s an itch I want to scratch. I’d heard about the project but, classic Marvel, they couldn’t tell me anything about it. Absolutely nothing. Zilch. So I met him being like, ‘I don’t know what this is about.’

Cocaine Bear 2

Elizabeth Banks’ also stated she would “take” the “opportunity” to direct a sequel to Cocaine Bear in a new interview with Rolling Stone.

I loved how subversive, crazy, silly and funny it was. I loved surprising people with the cast. I don’t think anybody was expecting Margot Martindale, who’s 70 years old, to shoot that kid. We had a lot of fun, and if I got the opportunity to surprise the audience and delight myself again, I would take it. I’ve been very fortunate to work across a lot of genres and things that appeal to me. Cocaine Bear also came to me during the pandemic. We were all locked away, and I loved the sense of fun inside of it. It was what I wanted to see. And it had this message about mankind’s culpability in nature’s demise. It spoke to me on a lot of levels.

2023-08-07 07:00:00+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem review,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem slaagt erin zich met een geheel eigen sketchachtige stijl te onderscheiden van Spider-Verse.,"Voor zij die het zich afvragen: ja, ik heb altijd al veel tv gekeken. Alleen waren het vroeger vooral tekenfilms: Pokémon, Batman, X-Men, Yu-Gi-Oh… Maar dus ook de Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Omdat CGI toch niet zulke geslaagde resultaten biedt, zoals de film uit 2014 aantoont (nightmare fuel!), besloten ze om voor deze versie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, terug naar de roots te gaan. En gelukkig maar.

Mutants, mutants everywhere

Een groep gewapende mannen dringt het laboratorium van wetenschapper Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) binnen. Ze zijn gestuurd door zijn baas bij het Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI), Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph, Loot) en willen zijn research naar mutanten in handen krijgen. Ze veroorzaken echter een ontploffing waarbij hij sterft. Toch nemen ze zijn onderzoek mee, maar tegelijk belandt er ook radioactief slijm in het riool. Vijftien jaar later worden vier mensachtige schildpadden (Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo en Raphael) opgevoed door hun adoptievader, rat Splinter (Jackie Chan), in datzelfde riool. Ze komen alleen maar naar buiten om boodschappen te doen, maar dromen wel van een normaal leven tussen de mensen. Daar wil hun vader niks van weten. Hij had zelf z’n eigen slechte ervaringen met mensen, waardoor hij besloot de jongens te trainen in vechtsport.

Zie je de initialen op de riemen? Handig! © Paramount Pictures

Per toeval ontmoeten de Turtles ook April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri, The Bear), een aspirant-journaliste die haar reputatie op haar middelbare school wil opkrikken door Superfly (Ice Cube) op te sporen, een dief die allerlei louche materialen steelt. Omdat Leo een oogje op haar heeft, besluiten ze haar te helpen. Maar Superfly blijkt redelijk letterlijk te nemen, want ook hij kreeg krachten door het slijm en wil wraak nemen op de mensen. Daarvoor gebruikt hij z’n eigen familie, de gemuteerde proefdieren van Stockman.

Een eigen stijl

De stemmen zijn bijzonder goed ingesproken door een jong viertal.

Toen Seth Rogen gevraagd werd om aan de film mee te werken, wou hij als levenslange fan teruggaan naar het “teenage” aspect van de Turtles. En dat voel je vanaf het eerste moment dat het viertal in beeld komt. Ze negeren de waarschuwingen van hun vader en willen hun eigen gang gaan. Terwijl ze bij elkaar zijn, praten ze ook constant door elkaar heen en vliegen de flauwe mopjes je om de oren. Toch hebben ze ook elk een eigen karakter en uiterlijk. (Met als handige tip dat de initiaal van hun namen op hun riem staat!) De stemmen zijn dan ook bijzonder goed ingesproken door het jonge viertal Micah Abbey als Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. als Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu als Leonardo, en Brady Noon als Raphael. De chemie is ook wel te danken aan de opnametechniek die ze voor Mutant Mayhem gebruikten. In plaats van elke acteur apart op te nemen, werden ze als groep bij elkaar gezet en dat zal wel geholpen hebben voor de broederlijke, chaotische sfeer.

Waar Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem zich nog in onderscheidt, is de keuze voor animatie. Als je iets anders probeert te doen in het genre kan je niet om Spider-Verse heen. Hoewel het er waarschijnlijk door geïnspireerd is, voelt het toch helemaal anders. De animatie heeft hier meer weg van tekeningen, wat duidelijk wordt gemaakt door de potloodlijnen die overal terugkomen: als een plant, reflectie in een bril, de schijn van het licht… Het ziet eruit als een mix van 2D en 3D en past heel erg goed. Geen enkel beeld lijkt ook stil te staan, er lijkt altijd wel iets geanimeerd zoals het licht dat uit een lamp straalt. Het is net als in Spider-Verse een lust voor het oog en zorgt ervoor dat je in elk frame wel iets origineels kan spotten. Ook het gebruik van kleuren is heel mooi, met vooral in het laatste deel veel neon dat eruit springt.

Stemmencast van toppers

Het characterdesign van Mutant Mayhem is ook uniek te noemen. Zo denk je misschien bij de titel “Niet weer mutanten” maar hier mag je de term eens letterlijk nemen. Na een vertederende scène met de babyschildpadden, krijgen de Turtles een eigen look en krijgt Donatello zelfs een bril omdat het beter bij z’n persoonlijkheid past. Maar het origineelst zijn Superfly en de mutanten: zowel lelijk en echt gemuteerd als aandoenlijk en sympathiek, je moet het maar kunnen. Ook de vechtscènes, vooral die van Splinter, zijn goed geïntegreerd. De muziek van Trent Reznor en Atticus Ross past met de mix van elektronische invloeden en klassieke instrumenten zoals piano bij de stijl en het gevoel van de film, maar doet wel denken aan wat Daniel Pemberton doet bij Spider-Verse. De soundtrack mag er ook best zijn en geeft ons het beste gebruik van 4 Non Blondes ooit.

Uniek character design. Let ook op de potloodlijnen. © Paramount Pictures

Het verhaal van Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem betreedt misschien wat platgetreden paden met een ongeleide professor en vrees voor mensen, maar de tienerinsteek en vooral die verwantschap met de slechteriken zorgt wel voor iets nieuws. Ik hou ook wel van de humor van Seth Rogen en Evan Goldberg, die het script schreven samen met regisseur Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. The Machines), en die is hier goed te voelen. (En een onverwachte, leuke running gag over my fave Mark Ruffalo!) Zo is popcultuur nooit ver weg en heb ik een paar keer echt goed gelachen, vooral met een aantal goeie oneliners.

De animatie heeft hier meer weg van tekeningen, en dat werkt heel goed.

Ook die worden bijzonder goed gebracht door de verder ook geweldige cast. Rijzende ster Ayo Ediberi geeft wat meer pit aan April, Maya Rudolph laat een gestoord accent horen dat een mix is tussen Duits en Brits, Ice Cube is schurk Superfly, Post Malone laat z’n zangstem genoeg horen, je kan ook John Cena, Seth Rogen, Natasia Demetriou (What We Do In The Shadows) en Rose Byrne horen maar vooral Paul Rudd is geniaal als Mondo Gecko, die praat als een soort foute surfer. Soms wordt er wat te veel moeite gedaan om de humor op peil te houden, maar het doelpubliek blijven wel kinderen natuurlijk.

Toch is er ook een emotionele kant die mooi naar boven komt en herkenbaar is voor iedereen die ooit een tiener is geweest. Als je jong bent, wil je alleen maar erbij horen en heb je daar alles voor over, en wil je vooral losbreken van je ouders. Zij willen hen dan weer zo veel mogelijk beschermen, wat vaak het omgekeerde effect heeft. Zelfs bij een “nieuw samengesteld” gezin als dat van de Turtles gaat dat op, en zo heeft elke categorie van kijker wel iets aan deze film.

Critics be damned, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" managed to have itself a monster debut at the box office over the weekend. A sequel to 2018's ""The Meg"" starring Jason Statham, Warner Bros. once again cashed in on adapting Steven Alten's book series for the big screen as the film took in $142.1 million globally in its debut. The question now becomes, will the movie have long enough legs to justify its blockbuster budget? Or will it suffer a big drop in the coming weeks resulting in a costly misfire? There are many, many factors at play here, so let's dive in.

Per The Numbers, director Ben Wheatley's ""Meg 2"" took in a somewhat modest $30.1 million domestically, putting it at number two on the charts, with a huge $112 million overseas debut (more on that in a bit). In North America, it was a surprising result as ""Barbie"" was pretty much uncontested for the top spot but ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and ""Oppenheimer"" were very much fighting for the silver medal. However, ""TMNT"" opened mid-week which took a little bit of luster away from the weekend, while Christopher Nolan's biopic about the man who gave us the A-bomb slowed down just a tiny bit in its third weekend. That paved the way for Statham and these big ass sharks to swim past the competition.

It sort of looked like the rough critical reviews were going to rain on this movie's parade (read our 4 out of 10 review here), but that proved not to be the case at all. Interestingly, the sequel actually scored better with audiences than the original. ""The Meg"" has a 46% critic rating and a 43% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Meanwhile, ""The Trench"" has a very poor 28% critic rating but a surprisingly decent 72% audience score. That is often the more important metric.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM1OTQ1OS9tZWctMi10aGUtdHJlbmNoLW1vbnN0ZXItZGVidXQtYXQtZ2xvYmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The DC superhero film Blue Beetle led weekend ticket sales with a modest $25.4 million opening, according to studio estimates Sunday.

The new entry starring Xolo Maridueña, is the rare comic-book film to put a Hispanic cast front and center.

The movie narrowly pushed Barbie out of the the top spot, after a record-setting run that left movie theaters colored pink for a month.

Barbie earned an additional $21.5 million dollars, increasing its global take to an eye-popping $1.28 billion globally.

Blue Beetle, starring Xolo Maridueña as a super hero won the box office race over the weekend, earning an estimated $25.4 million opening, according to studio estimates Sunday

The other half of Barbenheimer also continues to perform remarkably well for a movie so far into its run.

Christopher Nolan´s Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy as the title character took in $10.6 million in its fifth week.

With a $285.2 million domestic total, Oppenheimer now owns the distinction of being the biggest box-office hit never to land No. 1 at the weekend box office.

The previous record-holder for that unlikely stat is 2016´s Sing, which grossed $270.3 million in the shadow of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and the Oscar nominated Hidden Figures.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, dropped a spot to fourth place, earning an estimated $8.4 million.

The animated adventure has pulled in more than $88 million since it's box office debut.

The raunchy R-rated canine comedy ""Strays"" showed even less bite.

The film, with a voice cast including Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, landed in fifth place with $8.4 million.

Meg 2: The Trench fell two spots from last week to land in sixth place.

After four weeks at the top of the box office, Barbie, dropped to second place, earning $21.5 million dollars, increasing its global take to an eye-popping $1.28 billion globally

The deep sea adventure starring Jason Statham and Jing Wu reeled in $6.7 million.

Fright flicks take up a good portion of the remaining entries into the box office top 10.

Talk To Me came in at number seven.

The ghoulish thriller about a group of friends to grasp more than they can handle after they begin conjuring spirits via an embalmed hand scared up $3.2 million.

It was closely followed by Disney's Haunted Mansion, starring Rosario Dawson and LaKeith Stanfield with $3 million and eighth place.

El Sabor de la Navidad (working title A Merry Mexican Christmas) will bow Sept. 13 as part of TIFF’s special presentations program before becoming available on the Spanish-language streaming platform ViX in November.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

In the tradition of many holiday classics, El Sabor de la Navidad will follow three storylines that inevitably converge in the third act. All set in Mexico City during Christmastime, the first story follows an estranged daughter seeking reconciliation with her family; the second spotlights two rival Santa Clauses in Alameda Central Park; and the third features a lonely chef who cooks Christmas dinners for other families catching feelings for her assistant.

The romantic comedy stars Mariana Treviño (A Man Called Otto, House of Flowers), Andrés Almeida (Y tu mamá también, Ana), Armando Hernández (Blood of My Blood, Amar te Duele), Juan Carlos Medellín (Whiskey Cavalier, El Colapso), Mónica Dionne (The Arrival, The Wind of Fear) and Marco Treviño (Narcos: Mexico, Danyka). It was written by Jose Tamez, who produces under Ventanarosa alongside Hayek Pinault, with Lemon Studios’ Erica Sánchez also producing. Alejandro Lozano directed.

In February 2022, Ventanarosa inked a first-look deal with TelevisaUnivision to produce Spanish-language original movies for the Mexican-American media company’s streaming service ViX. The first film under that pact, Quiero tu Vida, premiered this May.

2023-07-31 16:45:00.435000+00:00,Ninja Turtles Interview: Jeff Rowe Talks TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,Jeff Rowe spoke to io9 about all things Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for his movie out August 2.,"Watching trailers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, one of the first things to come to mind is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Spider-Verse was such a game changer in animation that when you see any animated movie after it that looks a little bit different, it’s very easy to link the two. Especially when Turtles is coming out the same summer as the sequel Across the Spider-Verse was released. You assume there’s a link.
Jeff Rowe understands that, and is honored by the comparison, but doesn’t exactly agree with it. The director of not just Mutant Mayhem, but also co-director of The Mitchells vs. The Machines, sees the link more as a sign that animation has taken a new turn in its history than anything else. In fact, Rowe didn’t even look at past Ninja Turtles movies for inspiration. Instead, he says it was Netflix’s The Toys That Made Us that really gave him the most excitement when gearing up for the project.

As a long-time Turtles fan, Rowe connected more to the toys themselves than the movies or even the original animated series. He talked about that, Spider-Verse and so much more speaking to io9 recently. Rowe revealed the film was completely different in earlier iterations (it had Shredder as the villain), how difficult it was to get the incredible voice cast, the complex Turtles canon, and so much more. Check out our full interview below.
Germain Lussier, io9: Now, I know you were a huge Turtles fan growing up, so I’m sure you didn’t have to do too much research when you got the job. But I’m curious specifically about the previous movies. There are so many and they’re all so different. Did you rewatch them and what at all did you learn about them in terms of what you wanted to do and what you didn’t want to do?
Jeff Rowe: I honestly did not. The thing that I watched that was most useful to me was that Netflix documentary [series] The Toys That Made Us. T here is one specifically about the Ninja Turtles toys, and that was just like a conduit, portal, like straight back to my four-year-old self. I t really reminded me of the franchise and the characters and especially how tactile it was for me—l i ke how much of my connection to it specifically came from the toys, a nd the hours I spent imagining worlds and playing with them. And then when I got this job, I kind of deliberately did not want to cloud my take on it with too much of what had been done in the past. I encouraged that for the team too; a lot of people worked on the team who had never seen anything from Ninja Turtles, and they’d be like, “Oh, should we watch the movies?” And I would say, “No. Just come in and watch these other films instead and come into this with a fresh take.”

io9: Speaking of other films, this trailer has been playing in theaters, this summer especially, and people have seen [Mutant Mayhem] as almost like a disciple of the Spider-Verse movies. As if this movie might not exist if that didn’t happen. Would you say that’s accurate? And how often did that movie in that kind of style come up?
Rowe: I mean, people bring it up a lot. More than I would like, I think. But the original Spider-Verse, I think, is one of the great works of art of the 21st century. And I will take as many comparisons as people want to give me to that. But they’re doing a very different thing. They’re very slick and polished and about precision. And our look and our style is a lot more lo-fi in a good way. We’re like the grunge bands in the ‘90s . Just trying to do just a very different thing.
But yeah, I think it speaks to a thing that’s happening right now which is really exciting, where audiences don’t have the vocabulary yet because animation has been the same for 30 years and because it’s just been progressing on one track. Now that there’s like one different thing, and then two and three and four or five different things, the brain can only lump those together. I think hopefully in a couple of years time, people will be comparing things to Mutant Mayhem as much as they are to The Mitchells vs. the Machines or Puss in Boots. And these disciples of Spider-Verse will hopefully create their own lineages.

io9: Yeah. I agree. One of the many things I love about this movie is how it kind of balances this distinct ‘90s vibe for the original fans, but also tons of modern pop culture for teens and younger audiences. Was that part of the process early on or how did that kind of happen?
Rowe: That came from, we did a unique thing on the movie, which is just recording all the kids together. Like it’s an audio nightmare. Movies don’t do it. But we recorded all the kids together and the way they talk to each other, often the things that they would say in between takes and when they weren’t doing scenes was so funny and so natural and so engaging that we wanted the movie to feel more like that. And we would throw away the script and encourage them to talk about something. “Talk about a video you saw on YouTube.” Relate about that because that’s how they naturally related to each other. And then we’d be like, “What do you want?” And one of them would be like, “I want to hang out with Drake.” And it’s like, “Okay, great, let’s put that in the movie because that’s authentic to you.”
io9: But also you use a lot of ‘90s music. Like “No Diggity” is one of my favorite songs and I was freaked out during that scene. I can’t wait to see that again. But then 4 Non-Blondes, Tracy Chapman—talk about the music choices and how you brought those in?
Rowe: I was picking out a visual tone and style for the film very early on because we didn’t have a script yet. So I was just like making a mood board and I love the aesthetic of the late ‘80s , early ‘90s . The patterns, the colors. Spike Lee films. The music. New York hip-hop and underground club music of that era. It was a really exciting, optimistic time artistically. And the movie had to take place currently, but my love of the Turtles is tied to this love of the ‘90s, and it felt like a way to honor the history and maybe touch on some nostalgia without having them say “Cowabunga” every five minutes.

io9: Now I’m not going to get into spoilers, but I thought so much of this story, the villains and especially where the story ends up in terms of the Turtles, was so unique to this franchise. I remember thinking “Whoa, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Am I right in assuming that, and how conscious of a decision was that to sort of make a story that uses the origin but goes into different places?
Rowe: It was pretty conscious. One of the things we did early on is we would have these discussions, and a lot of times we’d have to grapple with canon and then we’d be like, “Wait, what is the canon?” Splinter, in some versions, he’s a human who turned into a rat. And in other versions, he’s a rat who turned into a human because the ooze makes the last animal that you touch transfer... like we realized very early on that none of it makes sense because a lot of it was made up by toy companies or cartoons. Then we’re like, “Well, I think we have to do some grounding.” W e want the film to be emotionally sharp and resonant and a lot of that comes from relatability. W e need the audience to feel like they can see themselves in these turtles and feel like they’re on the same journey as them. And that can only happen if it feels like it takes place more or less in our world. That required a lot of just grounding to get it there. So yeah, very early on we’re like, “Well, we’re going to have to change some things from canon and some people might take exception to that, but hopefully they’ll see what we did and understand why we did it, and appreciate the end result.”
io9: Oh, absolutely. Like I said, I think it works great. So this movie is called Mutant Mayhem. So the villains here are all these mutants. It’s one of the first Turtle things not to have Shredder as the villain. How early on was the decision made to be like “Let’s not use Shredder at all in this?”
Advertisement
Rowe: It came late. T he early version of the film [was] very different from what you’re seeing on screen. It’s like, they were just in high school the entire movie. Shredder was the villain. And then part of the process of making this— and that’s one of the amazing things about animation, is because you don’t have to do a live-action shoot on a compressed schedule, you have a lot of time to make decisions and make sure that you’re making the best decision. And we dropped some of that out. Maybe halfway through we’re like “It can’t be Shredder. He’s a human. It’s too much, too soon. He’s too big of a presence.” For this story about the Turtles being accepted and finding a place in the world, it would really make sense and it would really help the story if the villain was a mutant like they are, with a similar back story and [who could maybe be able to have a conversation with Splinter about like, “Look, we both hate humans. You go about it this way, I’m just going about it this way.” And we’re like, “That’s what this movie needs.” Hence Superfly and also deviating from the Baxter Stockman canon to create that character.
io9: Now Shredder isn’t the only big Turtles thing you hold back here. We don’t get Casey Jones, Krang, about a million other things. Was that hard? I mean, obviously if you made a sequel, you could use more things, but a sequel is never guaranteed. Was it hard not to use every toy in the toy box— almost literally, in this case— for the first movie ?
Rowe: There [ was a] point where we were like, “This is coming together pretty good. We’re liking what we’re making. We’re not blowing it. We’re not whiffing it.” So likely, based on the importance of this IP to Paramount, we will likely be making a sequel or have the opportunity to explore more things later. And it wasn’t confirmed and it’s still not confirmed. [Note: It has since been confirmed.] But, you know, I think I think everybody wants to spend more time with these characters and I think there’s a lot of things in the lore that we haven’t been able to address yet.

io9: I think one of the other reasons why the movie works so well is obviously the Turtles have a great arc, but Splinter and April also have incredible arcs in this movie. So talk about the difficulty in balancing those characters, having nice, full, rewarding arcs with also the Turtles.
Rowe: Yeah, I mean, we kind of just went in order. We’re like, “Well, okay, let’s just make sure the Turtles have like a good, satisfying arc.” And then if we can, there’s this great family story in here about the relationship with Splinter, and it seems like he should probably arc, too. That actually helps them arc. Okay, great. That fits in there. And then April’s a human, and by giving ourselves space to just focus on the Turtles, I think it then presented organic opportunities to insert April and Splinter into that story. T he more we were able to turn things to just be about acceptance, the more pieces started clicking together.
io9: Beyond the teenagers, the voice cast in this is like a who’s who of incredible people. Was it difficult to assemble them or did you get your top choice in every role? How did that work?
Advertisement
Rowe: Well, that’s the nice thing about doing a Seth Rogen movie. He just knows everybody. If you’re calling Jackie Chan and it’s like, “Hey, there’s this guy named Jeff Rowe, he co-directed this animated film you probably haven’t seen. Do you want to do that?” The answer would be “No.” But when it’s a Seth Rogen movie, people will sign up for it because he’s very talented and he has a great track record, and people know that’s going to be a fun project to work on.
io9: You mentioned Seth and Evan [Goldberg] who produced this. But you also worked with Phil Lord and Chris Miller too. They’re doing the Spider-Verse stuff now but you worked with them on Mitchells. Compare and contrast them as producing partners, because they’re some of the best in the business and we’re going to be watching their movies for decades.
Rowe: Yeah, I think they are more similar to each other than either party would care to admit about the other [laughs]. But they’re very friendly. They know each other really well. And the thing that I love about both of those teams is that at the end of the day, they just care about making a good movie. Seth is an A-list celebrity, right? He could phone this in, but he rolled his sleeves up and got in there and rewrote the script. Phil would [also] get in there and rewrite parts of Mitchells with us. They’re very involved, and they’re so dedicated to wanting the end product to be good, that they’re wonderful people to make movies with.
io9: That’s awesome. And this will be my last thing, but there’s a really funny Marvel joke [in Mayhem] that a udiences are going to love . Was that something you guys wrote or something that the kids came up with?
Advertisement
Rowe: I think that was a Seth suggestion. That was something he suggested in the session and it didn’t make it into the script. And then we’re like, “ Oh, he should say something like this.” But that was something that came up in conversations a lot when we were like trying to explain the logic of [a scene], and Seth would use that as an example. “It’s like the Hulk in the diner in Avengers. People are taking selfies with him. That’s probably what they think.” And then when we got into the recording session, we’re like, “They should just say that—t he y should just say that out loud, because they probably have the same reference point we do.”

2023-08-04 19:03:04+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Director Jeff Rowe on Rejecting the “Grounded” Trend and That ‘Avengers’ Reference,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe explains that Avengers reference and talks the line Ice Cube improvised.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe has pulled off an increasingly rare feat, as his latest entry in the Turtles franchise has been extremely well-received by both critics and audiences.
Rowe was the co-director on Mike Rianda’s Oscar-nominated The Mitchells vs. the Machines, and producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller highly recommended him to Mutant Mayhem producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg before Mitchells was even released. Rowe and Rogen quickly bonded over films such as Jurassic Park (1993), and so they were off and running on the three-year project.
Naturally, in a post-Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) world, comparisons between the two New York City films were inevitable, but Rowe sees it less from a stylistic standpoint and more from a spiritual one. Spider-Verse gave Mutant Mayhem license to take more chances, opting for a more rough-around-the-edges look.
“The first Spider-Verse really opened a lot of doors,” Rowe tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It really made it okay for studios to take chances on a film looking unique and maybe having a little bit more sophistication and emotional maturity in its storytelling. And it was such a seismic shift that it became expected. Suddenly, making movies that look like the style of CG animation over the past 30 years felt dated.”
Initially, Rowe and his collaborators thought of taking a more grounded approach to this new iteration of Ninja Turtles, but they ultimately decided to embrace the franchise for what it’s always been.
“There’s been a little bit of a trend with superhero films, and it probably really kicked off with Batman Begins, but it’s to take the preposterous elements of the franchise and the lore and make them black and tactical and grounded and whatever the realistic version is,” Rowe says. “And so we had thought about that early on, like, ‘Okay, how would you actually strap a sword to yourself and do these things?’ And we were like, ‘That’s just not the Ninja Turtles. They’re wacky. The designs are silly. That playfulness is what I loved about it as a kid, so let’s embrace that.’”
In the new film, the Turtles have grown tired of living in the shadowy sewers of New York City, as they desperately want to lead a typical teenage existence in high school. So they hatch a plan to save the city from Superfly’s (Ice Cube) evil plan in hopes that their authentic selves will be welcomed into the human world. The teenagers developed this belief through pop culture, namely Avengers: Endgame, as The Hulk’s heroic deeds have made the Green Monster more approachable on the street.
If their justification sounds oddly specific, it’s because it’s the same reasoning that Rowe, Rogen and their collaborators came up with when trying to explain why the Turtles would ever believe they’d be accepted by human beings.
“Seth was like, ‘Oh, I’m sure they’ve seen Avengers,’” Rowe says. “And for them, it’s like, ‘The Hulk saves the world [in Avengers: Endgame], so no one’s scared of him, and he can take selfies with people in a diner.’ And then when it came time to record the kids debating this decision, we were like, ‘We should just have them use the exact argument that we’re using in our story discussions. Let’s have the kids say that.’”
Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Rowe also discusses the great lengths that he and Rogen went to in order to retain the services of composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
So how did it feel to take center stage at Comic-Con? It was all on your shoulders.
Awful. (Laughs.) Horrible. Terrifying. People like me become animators to not be in the spotlight and to not have attention on them. So it was nerve-wracking, but it was a really good room with a lot of really dedicated fans. This franchise means so much to them, and it’s really exciting to share this with them. Hopefully, they approve it. Hopefully, we’ve done right by them, and they like it. But to be met with that kind of response [at Comic-Con] was really exciting and validating after a three-year filmmaking process.

So Phil Lord and Chris Miller recommended you for this on the heels of The Mitchells vs. the Machines, but apparently, you felt like you bombed both your meetings. In hindsight, do you think you were just getting in your own head about it?
Oh, a million percent. I live in my own head. The Mitchells vs. the Machines wasn’t out yet, and in a lot of those meetings, I would talk to James Weaver, one of the [Point Grey] producers on the film. And he’d be like, “Hi, nice to meet you …” And then he’d look at the name and say, “Jeff.” (Laughs.) And then I’d hear him start to play The Mitchells vs. the Machines trailer in the background, and it was clear that he had no idea who I was or what I had worked on. But thankfully, [Mitchells] had a good trailer, and people were like, “Okay, this guy seems like he’s not a turkey.”
And then they just kept moving me along until I met with Seth [Rogen] and Evan [Goldberg]. We really connected about wanting the same things out of the film and caring about naturalism and character and emotion, first and foremost. Seth and I have very similar taste in film, so it was always easy to relate to him or be like, “We need to try something like this.” He was always very receptive, and I left that final meeting thinking, “That might have gone well.” And it did.
Phil and Chris also produced Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). Did that film give you guys some added confidence that you could get weird and take even more risks?
100 percent. The first Spider-Verse really opened a lot of doors. It really made it okay for studios to take chances on a film looking unique and maybe having a little bit more sophistication and emotional maturity in its storytelling. And it was such a seismic shift that it became expected. Suddenly, making movies that look like the style of CG animation over the past 30 years felt dated. And so they really paved the way for what will hopefully be a huge generation of new filmmakers with very unique expressions.
Looking back, I appreciate the fact that the kids’ movies I watched growing up had a bit of darkness. Who Framed Roger Rabbit had Judge Doom. Back to the Future Part II had Old Biff, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) had plenty of that with Shredder. So I’m glad your film has a splash of darkness as well. How deep did these conversations go as far as having a healthy amount of darkness?
We weren’t like, “Let’s make the film dark,” but we would always operate from a place of story. We were always trying to tell a story that felt true and emotionally honest, and in the opening of the film, there isn’t a joke in the first five minutes. So it’s just a compelling scene, and that felt narratively right. It felt like the right way to execute that was to not cram it full of jokes. We even had a couple jokes in there at one point and we were like, “We actually have to cut these out because they’re ruining the tone.”
Seth and I would talk about how much we loved Jurassic Park as kids, and we saw it when we were probably too young to see it. And the opening of that film is terrifying to a five-year-old, but it imprinted on me. It’s still one of my favorite films, and it’s because it took those chances. It’s because it felt like I was getting away with something as a kid by seeing it, and Seth said, “The great thing about Jurassic Park is that it’s a monster movie for kids. This should be a monster movie for kids.” And then we started leaning into that more and not shying away from it.
When you guys eventually broke the news to the studio that Shredder would not be the villain of this film, did you cite cases like Chris Nolan saving the Joker for The Dark Knight?
That was our whole argument. We were like, “Look, if we do it here, then the next movie can make a billion dollars. Don’t we all want a billion dollars?” (Laughs.) The sales-y argument and the story argument was that Shredder is a big character when he’s on screen. He demands a lot of presence, and he takes up so much space in the story. So it was too much space in a movie where we’re also trying to reintroduce a new generation of Turtles and get audiences on board with this iteration. And having them meet not the ultimate villain, but a villain that’s more on their level, it really made a lot of story pieces come together. It helped us make the film that we ended up making.
Was the Avengers reference a tough sell to the studio as well?
No, that was fine. It was just funny. There’s so many of those things that we would just do, like the cold open. We would just do it and then we would show them that it worked in the execution. And then it was like, “Well, we can’t say no to that. It’s working, it’s getting a laugh in this test screening.” But that Avengers reference, we were talking about this story point, like, “Why do the Turtles think that this will be successful?” And I think Seth was like, “Oh, I’m sure they’ve seen Avengers.” And for them, it’s like, “The Hulk saves the world [in Avengers: Endgame], so no one’s scared of him, and he can take selfies with people in a diner.” And then when it came time to record the kids debating this decision, we were like, “We should just have them use the exact argument that we’re using in our story discussions. Let’s have the kids say that.”
Did Paramount feel even better about the Avengers reference once you told them the manner in which you’d present your choice for “Best Chris”? [Writer’s Note: Chris Pine, in standee form as Paramount’s Captain Kirk, was named the “Best Chris” by Splinter.]
(Laughs.) Those were so unrelated, but then they came together, yeah.
When Seth worked on The Lion King, he learned the difference that recording with your scene partners can make, so he told me that you guys followed suit as often as possible. Is that your preferred way to do it now, versus merging separate sessions together?
I can’t go back. I love John Cassavetes and Robert Altman’s films, and I love when a lot of people are talking at once. It feels so much like real life. And going into animation, I was like, “Well, that’s a thing we’ll never be able to do.” But now, with this film, we recorded like that, and it has that natural feeling. It feels improvised. It feels like friends hanging out, and everything else feels rigid by comparison. So, going forward, I can’t ever imagine not doing a film this way.

Your villain is Superfly and he’s voiced by Ice Cube. Did Cube have a laugh when you asked him to quote Ice-T’s “​​6 ‘n the Mornin’”?
No, that was his pitch! We had some dumb line. There was something silly in the script. He ripped open the door and was like, “It’s fly time!” or whatever. And I was just like, “This is stupid. Can you try something here?” And then he offered that. It was his improv. We were like, “Great, let’s go legally clear it, but that’s so funny and it needs to be in the movie.”
You also dropped 4 Non Blondes “What’s Up,” and it made for a really incredible moment, especially the gag that’s timed to the chorus lyric by way of a windshield. For the gag, did somebody have a eureka moment well after you decided to use the song?
No, the gag came first. Originally, we knew they had to drive and that we were gonna jettison them. I don’t know if we even had a singalong, but we were recording Paul Rudd and we were like, “What if they’re all singing a song together? Let’s try something. Can you sing the Dawson’s Creek theme song?” And we did that, so we had a version of it that was the Dawson’s Creek theme song. And then we were like, “I don’t know if that’s right. Let’s try other songs. Paul, what songs do you know?” And then Seth pitched “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes, and then Paul really took to that and really started singing it. And we were like, “This is really funny. Let’s get John Cena and the kids to do it, too.” And then we eventually got all of the actors to do a version of that, but it was half-found through improvisation.
Pop culture is a key part of this film, and you included moments of live-action footage from various movies and shows. Is live-action to this world what animation is to us? Is live-action their version of animation?
That’s a good question, and I never thought about that. That’s a good explanation that I think I’m gonna lean into now. If I answer that question honestly with what I’ve always assumed in my brain, it is an insane answer, but in the world of the film, when they look at live-action, I think they see their own animated version of it. And I don’t know why I think that, and I don’t even know if that makes sense.
When I was kid, you were nobody if you didn’t have the Turtle Blimp. Do you think there’s a way to incorporate the Turtle Blimp into your world? Or is it too over the top?
There’s been a little bit of a trend with superhero films, and it probably really kicked off with Batman Begins, but it’s to take the preposterous elements of the franchise and the lore and make them black and tactical and grounded and whatever the realistic version is. And so we had thought about that early on, like, “Okay, how would you actually strap a sword to yourself and do these things?” And we were like, “That’s just not the Ninja Turtles. They’re wacky. The designs are silly. That playfulness is what I loved about it as a kid, so let’s embrace that. Let’s be really grounded with New York, and then in an environment like TCRI, let’s make it look like the Technodrome.” It’s a dated, aging technology environment anyway, so it kind of makes sense. And if we found a way to make the Pizza Van make sense, then there’s definitely room to make a Turtle Blimp make sense within our own internal logic.

Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, are they secret fans of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
(Laughs.) They love it so much. They were like, “Don’t tell anyone in the press,” but it’s their favorite thing. No, I think they had no interest in Ninja Turtles, but they were fans of The Mitchells vs. the Machines, and they’re fans of Seth’s movies. Our music supervisor, Gabe Hilfer, knows their manager and was able to get us a meeting with them, and I think they took it just based on being fans of our previous work. So we showed them a lot of concept artwork and just talked about what we were trying to do with it, artistically. And they were like, “Okay, cool. Let’s see a script or a version of the movie or something.” And we were like, “Yep, yep, we’ll send it to you any minute.” And then Seth and I were like, “We have to rewrite this. We have to make this better. If our favorite composers are going to read this, then now is the time to change anything that we have doubts about in the story. Let’s really try to make it bulletproof and put our best foot forward.” So we did a whole round of rewriting just based on them potentially composing it.
Is the voice behind Scumbug still a secret?
No, I believe Scumbug is credited as Alex Hirsch, creator of Gravity Falls, but sometimes, it’s me doing it. It’s a blend of different voices, and our sound designer, Mark Mangini, also added some digital stuff. So it’s heavily processed, but it’s really Alex’s performance. He brought so much to the character.
I appreciated the ‘90s rap soundtrack, and that’s something that Paramount’s latest Transformers movie also leaned into for its 90s-set movie. Was there ever any overlap? Did anyone have to say, “Sorry, guys, Rise of the Beasts just used this”?
There was one. We had LL Cool J’s “Mama Said Knock You Out” in one screening of the movie at one point, and they were like, “Ah, maybe don’t use that. Transformers is using that in a prominent way.” I haven’t seen it yet, so I don’t know if they did end up using that or not.
They did.
Well, that was pretty much it. The film had to take place in 2023, but it feels like a ‘90s property to me. So the soundtrack was a way to evoke those feelings of nostalgia without making the movie a period piece, if that makes sense.
Decades from now, when you’re reminiscing about the making of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, what day will you likely recall first?
Oh man, there’s so many. The first record with Ice Cube was so exciting. It was one of those days where the movie really came alive and it felt like it could be something. He came in and he was kind of quiet and cautious, and we’re like, “Does he want to be doing this? Did he just say, ‘Why am I here?’” He almost seemed like he was low energy or something, and we were like, “What’s going on?” And then he got on the microphone, and the first line that he delivered was so funny and intense and energetic. I felt how people probably felt watching Robin Williams do Genie for Aladdin. It was so exciting. We were all looking at each other, saying, “Are you hearing this? This is incredible.” And it was.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is now playing in movie theaters.

2023-08-04 18:00:47+00:00,"TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Director Talks Needle Drops, Sequel Teases, And Fixing A Broken Movie [Exclusive Interview]","We spoke with TMNT: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe about the struggles making the movie, sequel teases in the credits scene, needle drops, and much more.","So I wanted to start off by asking, was this movie intentionally built as an immigration fable? Because the Turtles very much feel like children of an immigrant, learning martial arts and becoming this family in the face of prejudice. It feels like them learning martial arts goes a lot more beyond just being a cool thing for them to do to defend themselves.
It wasn't necessarily built to be an immigration fable, but as the story started coming along organically, I think we started recognizing the threads and feeling like, ""Oh, Splinter feels like maybe a first generation parent who moved to the country."" A lot of people on the team have family situations like that. And it became something that we continued to lean into, because it felt resonant for a lot of people. So it wasn't the intention, but it became highlighted through execution.
Did you have to fight to cast four relatively unknown kids as the Turtles, or did Seth Rogen bringing in a lot of his friends to voice the other roles help make that an easier thing to convince the studio to do?
I think that was the trade-off, because doing the film was contingent on casting real teenagers in the roles, and I think it was just understood very early on that this will be four unknown actors. We're going to do a big casting search. We worked with Rich Delia, who was so good at this and brought us hundreds of people, and we found Nick [Cantu], Brady [Noon], Micah [Abbey], and Shamon [Brown Jr.], who are all amazing. But I think beyond that, the studio wanted some names in there and some marketability, so we went bigger on all of the other roles.
Are you worried about the kids aging out of the roles at all? Like their voices changing and whatnot?
No, I think we'll lean into it. It would be the funniest thing in the world if, for movie two, Micah Abbey just has the world's deepest voice, and we're just like, ""Okay, great. Let's make him huge now. Let's give him muscles,"" whatever. Our whole filmmaking philosophy is built around accommodating reality, if that makes sense. So if the kids are changing in their lives, then the Turtles should change in the film, and we'll just write to that.
Speaking of which, obviously a big part of the dynamic is the teenage energy that they bring to the table. I know you had them record together, which was a really cool touch. We all know teens can be raunchy little goblins sometimes — we were all teens once. Was there anything particularly hilarious that stands out from the improvising sessions that you guys had that was maybe a little too ""not safe for kid audiences""?
No, I mean the kids were pretty tame. I think they knew the rules. In earlier versions of the script, Seth and I would just write profanity into it, and we're like, ""Let's see how much we can get away with."" And then Brady Noon, for example, was always excited, ""Can I say s*** in this? Okay, look, I'll just say s***."" He was so happy to be given permission to swear for his job. But when improv-ing, they were generally pretty within the reins. They were pretty reined in. Ice Cube, however, there's a lot. We had to sort through a lot of what he said, all devastatingly funny. A lot of it, this cannot go in this PG family movie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGFzaGZpbG0uY29tLzEzNTczNDUvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLWRpcmVjdG9yLWplZmYtcm93ZS1tdXNpYy1zZXF1ZWwtZXhjbHVzaXZlLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-10 15:00:00+00:00,TMNT: Mutant Mayhem's Screenwriter Crashed Our X Space. Here's What We Learned,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem screenwriter Dan Hernandez crashed our X Space on the movie -- here's what we learned from him, from his favorite Turtle to what he took from Detective Pikachu.","Spoiler warning: The below story contains some spoilers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
IGN was having a casual X Space ( which you can listen to in full here ) about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem when there was a surprise: co-writer Dan Hernandez crashed the chat, answering any/all questions we had about the film and providing insight into the creative decisions that helped elevate the project. (Editor’s Note: while the Writers Guild of America is currently on strike, including promotional work, the WGA’s rules allow for members to ""talk about your projects on your own accord on your own social media,” which Hernandez did on his own X account).
Barely a week into its theatrical run, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has already scored big with critics and fans alike . IGN’s Tom Jorgensen praised the Jeff Rowe-directed, Seth Rogen-produced animated adventure for its “confidence, energy, and heart” before claiming it “represents a new high for the Turtles on the big screen. “
And Hernandez, who also worked on 2018’s Detective Pikachu, had a lot to say, so we’ve distilled his many, many insights into a quasi-Q&A attempting to encapsulate what it was like penning one of the summer’s biggest surprises. See his full quotes below.
His favorite Turtle changed after he wrote the script
“Well, I can tell you that I entered this traditionally as a Raph kind of guy, and by the end of working on the screenplay with everyone, I kind of was a Donnie guy and I didn't expect that evolution. I think probably in my personal life that I am still the Raph, because my emotions are not very far from the surface most of the time. But I really gained an appreciation for Donnie and writing Donnie… in a more kind of modern way. And so much was brought by the actors to the movie... Yeah, he really cracked me up. So I kind of am like, I don't know. I'm having an identity crisis a little bit.”
He took lessons he learned from Detective Pikachu and brought them to Mutant Mayhem
“Detective Pikachu was an extremely challenging script to write for a lot of different reasons, one of which was that because it was Detective Pikachu and not Ash and Pokémon tournament battling and things like that, you kind of had to be creative in the way that you were honoring the franchise and things of the franchise, but at the same time, saying, ‘We literally cannot do what people are expecting.’ So we have to give ourselves a little bit of license to do things that we think are true to the spirit of it without being literally the same thing that everyone has seen and been familiar with for decades. And I think that that feeling of experimentation and that feeling of ‘how do you calibrate what still feels like Pokémon into this different sort of delivery system’ I think, was a real lesson for Turtles, because as for people who've seen the movie, it does deviate from sort of the, quote, ‘canonical’ source material in some significant ways.”
Superfly was the scariest — and most rewarding — character to tweak
“I can only speak for myself, and obviously I co-wrote the movie with my partner, Benji Samit, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jeff Rowe, and Brendan O'Brien, who all would maybe have different answers to this question. But for me, I think that the entire development of separating Baxter from Superfly was, I think, to me, the biggest creative risk and one that I felt really, for me, was successful and different, but not so different that it felt like we were not honoring this thing that we all love. But at the same time, I felt that there was a creative risk there.
“ ""The entire development of separating Baxter from Superfly was, I think, to me, the biggest creative risk.
“And then when you see Ice Cube's performance and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter, I think it was really moving and really good. And I think it deepened that character and both of those characters and sort of the origin of the turtles. But I don't think it was necessarily an obvious place to start because it does deviate, at least for me, from at least what I grew up with. And so I think that I was one of the people that said, ‘Oh, can we really do this?’ And then after thinking about it was like, ‘Yeah, we can. Why not? Let's try.’ “
He doesn't think it leaned too heavily on references
“It was different references, but I think there's a shorthand in a reference. And I think that when you get four brothers who all have a shared media experience on some level, they all are watching the same things and they're experiencing the same things and they're processing them through their different individual personalities, but they have this shared frame of reference. I think that it felt very naturalistic to me. And so I think that in 2045 when this film is entered into the National Registry of Historic Films and shot into space, will the aliens understand every reference? Maybe not. But that's okay. It's a document of its time and place and an authenticity of its time and place. And I think that that's one of the exciting things about turtles is that this is a movie that came out in 2023. It always will be… Yes, it's steeped very much in the ‘90s, but it's also of its time, I think.”
He’s confident the Turtles aren’t going anywhere
[Continuing to talk about the use of references]: “It's true to itself. And so I don't think the turtles are going anywhere. I think they're going to long outlive me anyway. And so when someone else takes a crack at this in the future, they're going to have their own references and they're going to have their own way of speaking and being. And it's like these archetypes I think will endure because that is, I think, in my opinion, ultimately the power of the turtles more than anything. But I think that the way that they express themselves, it's constantly evolving. It's constantly evolving. And that's good. That's actually a good thing.
“ ""When someone else takes a crack at this in the future, they're going to have their own references.
“So to me, it felt like a very organic way of them communicating with each other in this current landscape where every kid has a phone. Everyone has a phone. Everyone is being constantly inundated with media and you can curate your own media experience. And what Donnie is watching, he's the most online of them, and so he has a certain frame of reference. I think that to be true to kids of that age, you had to lean into that. So to me, that's why I think it ultimately made sense, I guess.”
Many of the movie’s best lines were improvised
“Tons, tons and tons of lines. I mean, I don't know the full iteration of the evolution of it, but, I mean, Seth, because he's a comedic genius, he loves that improvisational style, and getting those Turtle actors in the same place at the same time to be able to be kids together, to be able to actually develop a relationship. I mean, so much of it came from those kind of riffing sessions. And I know the other actors also added a lot.
“I know Ice Cube improv'd the ‘6 in the mornin' police at my door,’ sort of that reference to the Ice-T song, which is unbelievable, and how it's just true to that Superfly character. And it just suggested a whole other... It suggested an interior life for Superfly where he's listening to rap and he has favorite songs. And I think that that really dimensionalizes these people. They're not just arch fiends. It's like, ‘Oh, also, Superfly really likes music.’ That's cool, that's different.”
The score blew him away
“It's honestly incredible. I love Nine Inch Nails, so for me, I still can't believe that that really happened. That was one where I really, this is going to sound maybe a little new age-y, but my theater teacher in high school had a belief that an audience decided whether something was fundamentally good or bad within one second of the curtain opening. That's really stuck with me for many years, which is, when something opens with confidence, there's a psychological thing that happens, I think, where the audience feels like oh, I'm in good hands here. I feel like these filmmakers or these artists know what they want to do. At least for me, watching that opening scene, I had a sense of, ‘Oh, okay, this movie is good. This movie is going to be good.’ I say that as a fan, not just as someone involved with part of the creation of it, but just in watching the completed product, I said, ‘Oh, wow, this really sets a great tone.’ I was really, really thrilled with how it came out in the finished product. I thought that was awesome.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtcy1zY3JlZW53cml0ZXItY3Jhc2hlZC1vdXIteC1zcGFjZS1oZXJlcy13aGF0LXdlLWxlYXJuZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 22:13:35+00:00,Seth Rogen Made Sure ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Animators Were Not Overworked & Have “A Really Good Work-Life Balance”,The animators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem were taken care of by not being overworked and had a good work-life balance.,"The animators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem were taken care of by not being overworked. Director Jeff Rowe and producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg made sure the staff could work on the animated movie while continuing to maintain a good work-life balance.
“That was the thing that was really important to us on this film, and I learned it from Seth and Evan because in getting to know Seth, I’m like, ‘He has a really good work-life balance and everyone at Point Gray does,'” Rowe said in an interview with Insider. “And I asked him about that and he is like, ‘Well, we’re like when you’re doing live-action, sometimes you’re on a set for 40 days in a row and it is exhausting and tiring. And we want to make sure that our people have time away from that and that it doesn’t become their entire lives.’”
He continued, “I really took that to heart and wanted to make sure that when we made this film, we did it ethically.”
According to Rowe, the staff worked three days a week with some opting to work from home in Scotland.
“We’d be like, ‘Great, let’s figure that out, and let’s accommodate that because that’s your process and that’s what leads you to make your best art,'” Rowe added. “And we would often do that with most of the team and just try to make sure everyone always felt supported.”
“I never want the team to be suffering more than I am. And I also hopefully am suffering more than the team because I’m the captain and I’m paid to absorb that, and they’re not. It’s important to preserve that. People just do better work when they’re rested and have home lives.”

2023-07-28 10:00:00-04:00,Seth Rogen did Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Marvel scares him,"Seth Rogen, producer behind The Boys, Invincible, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, plans to stay far away from the Marvel and DC universes.","What does this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie have in common with 2011’s oddball superhero flick The Green Hornet? A name: Seth Rogen.
And while that might not seem like a feather in Mutant Mayhem’s cap, all the other Seth Rogen-produced comic book adaptations between the two do: There’s Preacher, The Boys, and Invincible, with more seasons and spinoffs of the latter two on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem looks to follow that streak.
The four wisecracking, pizza-scarfing turtles have featured in cartoon shows, movies, and toys for so long that it’s easy for their comic book origins to be eclipsed. In 1983, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird assembled their lightly parodic comics series from bits of every blockbuster superhero comic of the time: the teenagers of New Mutants and New Teen Titans; the mutants of the X-Men; and above all, Frank Miller’s Daredevil, from which they borrowed ninjas and martial arts, an origin story involving weird chemicals, a mentor named after a piece of wood, and a faceless horde of bad guys named after a bodily extremity.
Their self-published comic was the kind of sales and licensing success that rocked an industry still stretching its muscles from decades of publishing consolidation. So it’s not merely that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are an evergreen brand — they’re also a shoo-in for Rogen, who has quietly made a second career of racking up hugely successful comic book adaptations not based on Warner Bros. or Disney properties.
Polygon sat down to chat with Rogen in anticipation of the film, which he co-wrote and executive-produced (and for which he recorded the voice of Bebop), and which features the work of director Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and a cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Giancarlo Esposito. Paramount has already announced development on a sequel and a Paramount Plus TV spinoff, making Mutant Mayhem the dawn of a new era of the ever-mutating franchise.
[Ed. note: This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike against the AMPTP went into effect.]
Polygon: My favorite way to talk about TMNT’s arc from comics to a transmedia franchise is to point out that it started with making puns about Daredevil. What do you think it is about this really unique comic about altered reptile karate kids that keeps capturing different generations’ hearts and minds?
Seth Rogen: Someone smart once said all the best ideas start as jokes. And I think that this firmly falls into that category. It started as a way for two comic book writers to make each other laugh, literally. They were they were doodling in their sketchbooks, trying to crack each other up, and that’s where the first images of this came from.
But, like great writers, they imbued it with something that is undeniably relatable and resonant, which is the teenage part. That word is what makes it go from being a silly thing that is disposable, to something that weirdly has resonated with people for 40 years. It’s because they’re teenagers, and they feel this desire to be a part of the normal world, and this desire to be understood, and that they’re fun and kind of reckless and immature. That is really the thing that has made them resonate for so long. To me, it’s the thing that I thought was also the most underexplored. But it started, literally, as a comic book, and then became a Saturday morning cartoon and became toys — a lot of toys.
And I loved the toys. The toys themselves honestly had so much creativity put into them, and so many weird details and artistic elements. Something me and Jeff [Rowe] always talk about is how the Mondo Gecko toy — his tail had a roller skate tied to it, suggesting that [laughs] it was too heavy for him to drag around and so he, like, thought to put a roller skate on it to roll it around behind him. Little things like that were so imaginative, and they really have stuck in my head for 35 years.
And then the movies! I skateboarded because of the Ninja Turtles, and I did karate — it really tapped into a lot of things that were really popular in the ’80s, and ’90s as well. I felt like I was constantly the recipient of their goals; everything they were trying to do was really landing on me.
You’re quietly one of the biggest producers of indie comics adaptations in Hollywood. Preacher, The Boys, Invincible, and going back to The Green Hornet. How do you define your taste in comics? What kind of comic is the comic that grips you so hard that you go, Yeah, I think I want to make this my job for a year?
Well, first of all, it’s everything that is not Marvel and DC. [laughs] So that eliminates a lot right away. I grew up going to comic book shops, and it’s funny, video stores are making a slight comeback in some ways. This idea of browsing and not having things fed to you — as I think people feel we are now when it comes to entertainment — but instead entering the fair market of entertainment and just wandering around and seeing what catches your eye.
That’s what I always did with comic books; I would go to the comic book shop and I would just walk around. And you see this comic book and it catches your eye, and you see that comic book and it catches your eye. Those have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?
Like, I love Akira — what am I going to add to Akira? Things like that, where it’s out, and it’s good, it’s a movie and it exists. That’s something we think of also. For [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem], honestly [co-writer Evan Goldberg and I] felt like there was an unexplored facet, and as people who have written a lot of teenage films and have been cinematically linked to that genre a lot over the years, we were like, Oh, like, that’s totally different for this, is if we do a teenage version of it. A lot of it is just thinking, Could we bring this to life well and do it in a way that, as fans of it, we wouldn’t be annoyed with ourselves if we were watching it from the outside?
What has turned you off from Marvel and DC?
Honestly, probably fear. [laughs] We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.
It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with? And what’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this. So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!
Working on those bigger-budget, bigger-scope projects can be a real beast, and so can animated films. Are there specific lessons that you took from them for Mutant Mayhem?
I approach them very similarly. That’s something that I realized I used to think was a bug, and now I think it’s a feature. [laughs] A lot of people who make animated movies really approach them like animated movies, and they are constantly, from a writing standpoint, thinking of how to use the medium of animation, in the cutting pattern, in the scene patterns and all that. I’m firmly from the live-action world and so I very much write in the style of a live-action movie.
To me, I’m trying to bring what I would consider a traditional cinematic sensibility to the structure and the flow and how the scenes are, and not play too much into the medium in that way. And then to give the whole thing a look that is just, like, insane, was really a fun way to shade the whole thing.
It was unexpected to me, and I was honestly a little worried at what a big swing the look was at first. But the more I saw of it, I just started to get more and more excited about, and then started writing towards it, and thinking, OK, we have this crazy look. What do I want to see executed in this look? [laughs] What would be fun to watch?
Do you have comics on your bucket list for adaptation? Or, alternatively, what comics are you reading these days that you can’t put down?
That’s a good question. What have I been reading? I read old comics, from time to time. There’s these Green Lantern comics I’ve been reading, I love all those Grant Morrison Superman ones, I was rereading those because I heard that that’s what the James Gunn Superman movie was gonna be inspired by. I read them when they first came out, but I feel like I was distracted, so I went back.
Are there any that I wish we could make or adapt? Every once in a while? Yeah, those Grant Morrison ones are really appealing. We3 is something I’m a big fan of. It seems maybe just too sad honestly; it just bummed me out.
[Ed. note: We3 is a comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely about a trio of weaponized cyborg-animal hybrids. It’s infamous for its extreme violence and extreme pathos.]
We’ve kind of been down that road — and we know Grant a little bit, we’ve talked to him. That’s what’s nice, is we’ve done well with things that were traditionally considered unmakeable, essentially, for a long time. But also we don’t want to ruin things we love. So we’ll have very honest conversations with Grant and just talk about it and where his head’s at, and where our heads are at. Things like We3, we’ve talked to him about several times over the years. And we’re kind of always like, Yeah, I just don’t think this is the thing right now. There’s things like that — we really talk to the creators to make sure that we all think it’s a good idea, at that moment, in that way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODA4NjMxL3NldGgtcm9nZW4tdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy10aGUtYm95cy1pbnZpbmNpYmxlLWludGVydmlld9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzgwODYzMS9zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtdGhlLWJveXMtaW52aW5jaWJsZS1pbnRlcnZpZXc?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-10 15:25:00.571000+00:00,Seth Rogen Loves TMNT So Much He Busted His Head Open With Nunchucks,Rogen says wanted to be Mikey so bad he immediately cracked his head and a childhood lamp showing off his ninja skills,"During a press junket interview for the upcoming animated film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, actor and co-writer Seth Rogen revealed that he’s been enamored with the heroes in a half shell for so long that he’s got the battle scars to prove it. More precisely, Rogen cracked his dome open playing with nunchucks like Michelangelo, as many of us have.
TMNT: Mutant Mayhem follows younger versions of the turtle quartet as they try to gain popularity among their fellow New Yorkers by putting a stop to the villainous Superfly’s crime wave. The animated film includes a star-studded cast of Hollywood actors in supporting roles including Rogen as Bebop, Ice Cube as Superfly, John Cena as Rocksteady, and action-movie legend Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, to name a few.

Speaking with Empire Magazine, Rogen revealed that his fanboy-related TMNT injury came soon after his father gifted him his pair of nunchucks.

“Part of the reason I did karate was because of the Ninja Turtles,” Rogen said. “Me and [co-writer Evan Goldberg] both did karate together. My dad got me nunchucks that I cracked my head open with, because I was obsessed with the Ninja Turtles, and Michelangelo specifically.”

Goldberg added to Rogen’s painful recountings of his ninja faux pas, divulging that it was more than Rogen’s head that the comedy actor broke when displaying his nunchuck skills, saying “Seth had just got these nunchucks. He was like, ‘Yo, check this out, I want to show you this awesome move,’ and just immediately shattered a huge chandelier from his parents’ house into a billion pieces. It took us, like, five hours to clean. On a sitcom, you’d be like, ‘This is too broad.’”
“It was instantaneous,” Rogen added. “It was as though what I was trying to show him was my ability to destroy a lamp.”

In retrospect, it’s probably best that Rogen fancied Mikey instead of Leonardo or Raphael. One could only imagine the kind of physical and property damage a kid could do if left unattended in a house with twin katana or two sais.

2023-07-26 15:00:00+00:00,"After a Decade in Limbo, Brian Robbins Is Giving Paramount a Makeover With ‘Ninja Turtles,’ Tom Cruise and ‘Gladiator 2’","Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins explains the film studio's new look, with ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and a ""Gladiator"" sequel.","Something was amiss with Michelangelo’s waistline.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the team behind the high school comedy “Superbad,” had sold Brian Robbins, the CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, on the idea of adding some adolescent anarchy into their animated reboot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But there was a problem with the initial designs for the film’s four reptile heroes: Instead of looking like muscular teens, these Turtles were scrawny and malnourished, barely strong enough to wield nunchucks or hurl a throwing star. “They looked like they were on Ozempic,” Robbins jokes.

In his peripatetic career, the 59-year-old Robbins has been on every end of these kind of creative discussions, working as an actor, writer, director, producer, digital entrepreneur and now, studio chief. And that separates him from other movie moguls, who arrive at the C-suite from MBA programs and years spent in the corporate trenches.
“He’s actually made movies, which puts him in a different category from most studio executives,” says Rogen. “He has a fundamental understanding of the process. He knows how to wrangle a movie into existence. So you can have a different kind of conversation with him.”
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the result of the four-year journey to reinvigorate the tired kid’s franchise, opens in theaters on Aug. 2, and Robbins is so bullish on what Rogen and Goldberg have delivered that he’s developing a sequel. In a sign of how much the entertainment business is changing, Paramount and Nickelodeon will also produce two seasons of a streaming series with the voice cast from the movies that will serve as a “bridge” between the films.
If “Mutant Mayhem” draws crowds, it will end Paramount’s summer on a high note. But as Robbins settles into a white leather chair on the deserted set of “CBS Mornings” in July, all the momentum he’s established at the studio he’s led for two years is about to collide with a pair of labor strikes that will bring Hollywood to a standstill. There are still 48 hours to go before contract negotiations collapse between the studios and the actors union, but Robbins knows where this is heading. “They’re going to strike,” he says with an air of resignation.
And on July 14 they do, sending 150,000 actors to the picket lines alongside the 11,500 screenwriters who have been holding out since May for a contract that, among other things, gives them more generous royalties from the streaming services that license their work. The effects of this industrywide shutdown are seismic — movies and shows have stopped shooting, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without paychecks. And the delicate social fabric of the entertainment ecosystem has frayed, with each side faulting the other for letting it come to this. As a member of the directors guild, as well as a former member of the actors union, Robbins has a unique perspective on what’s going on.
“I’ve been on all sides of it,” he says. “I’m a guy who went to my mailbox and got residuals. I know how important that is to actors and writers. There has to be a way forward, and hopefully we’ll find it soon. Strikes have happened before, but this one is taking place at a difficult time.”
Outside of “Barbie,” things aren’t going so hot for the Hollywood studios who write the diminishing residual checks. The cable business is vaporizing, movies have been eclipsed by TikTok and YouTube, and streaming, which was supposed to usher in a golden era of entertainment, turned out to be too expensive to maintain. As for the box office, it’s down nearly 20% from pre-COVID levels — a sign that the filmgoing audience could be more comfortable watching movies at home. Even two of Paramount’s biggest franchises, both in their seventh installments, are showing signs of aging. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” based on the popular toys, and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” Tom Cruise’s latest outing as agent Ethan Hunt, opened below expectations this summer. They will likely not turn a profit, given their massive budgets, in their theatrical runs.
“You can’t deny that cash flow at media companies is less than it was or that their share prices are way down,” Robbins says. “There’s been major disruption in this business. We’ll get through it, but we’re going through a painful transition.” He doesn’t seem to be sweating the situation, though it helps that the heavily air-conditioned “CBS Mornings” set makes that impossible. “Why do they always keep these places so cold?” Robbins says with a theatrical shiver that betrays years spent as one of the teen stars of “Head of the Class.” Those sitcom days are long past Robbins, who is presiding over Paramount as the studio has mounted an impressive revival, one supported by hits like “Top Gun: Maverick,” “The Lost City” and “Smile.” And on the horizon are sequels to “Paw Patrol” and “Gladiator,” as well as “If” from “A Quiet Place” director and actor John Krasinski.

Robbins has also established strong relationships with the creative community. “As big as the stakes are, he always stays cool,” says Christopher McQuarrie, the director of “Dead Reckoning Part One.” “He’s also the only head of studio who’s ever called me just to ask how I was doing.”
It’s a shift in fortunes for a studio that had spent much of the previous decade in limbo while its parent company was engulfed in corporate melodrama featuring a merger, leadership struggles and a feud involving its owners, the Redstone family. (The revolving door of names for the conglomerate that owns the studio morphed from Viacom to Viacom-CBS to, ultimately, Paramount Global, illustrating these chaotic shifts.) Robbins politely alludes to what came before when I tell him that visiting the Paramount lot at that time was eerie — a funereal quiet hung over the place.
“Yeah, they had a great run in the early aughts, and then there was a seismic shift, and there was a lot of drama corporately at Viacom, and it just created a downward spiral,” he says.
Paramount no longer feels like it’s been left behind by the business. While Robbins may be altering the perception of the studio, the knock on him is that the most successful films that Paramount has released during his tenure originated under the regime of his predecessor, Jim Gianopulos. Robbins counters that it can take decades to develop a project, to say nothing of the work that goes into making and marketing it. “You ask who greenlit a movie?” he says. “It’s semantics. There’s a lot of people that deserve credit for ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ or ‘Mission: Impossible.’ But over the last two years, it’s been up to my team to see these movies through production and bring them into the world.”
Studio executives tend to be hard-charging, blustery sorts. And while Robbins is a workaholic with a healthy ego, he’s got a laid-back energy that separates him from the pack. He punctuates sentences with “man,” sounding more like a surfer than a suit, and has an easygoing confidence that’s disarming.
“I’ve never seen Brian nervous,” says Kenan Thompson, who worked with Robbins on his first feature, 1997’s “Good Burger.” “He always has his legs crossed, giving off this air of ‘I’ve got this all under control.’”
“This is blowing my mind,” Robbins confesses to me. “This is totally surreal.”
And as I survey the scene in front of us on a muggy June night in Brooklyn, it’s hard to disagree. After all, I’m staring directly at Pete Davidson, who’s peacocking in a blue velour tracksuit that’s been spray-painted with the face of a Transformer, traversing a line of fans screeching at him for selfies. In the distance, there’s a 15-foot statue of an Autobot, a new addition to this stretch of Flatbush Avenue. It’s all part of the extravaganza that Paramount has orchestrated to promote “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” But that’s not what Robbins is referring to. It turns out he grew up in Marine Park, Brooklyn, a short subway ride from here. “We went back and forth on this street all the time,” he says. “I never would have thought I’d be at something like this.”
Robbins’ family relocated to Los Angeles when he was 14 so his father, an actor, could land better jobs. Growing up, he’d run lines with his dad before auditions. Eventually, Robbins decided to try out for things himself. He secured guest spots on “Knight Rider” and “Growing Pains” and was a finalist for “Risky Business” and “War Games” before landing his breakthrough role as a rebellious prodigy on “Head of the Class.”
Dylan Coulter for Variety
“It was amazing,” Robbins says. “I was 18 years old, and I was on one of the biggest shows on television.”
He calls the sitcom his “film school.” On set, he befriended the crew, grilling them about their jobs. “Everyone was so open,” he remembers. “They let me hang out in the writers’ room or took me to the editing room and taught me how they selected shots.”
He decided that his future lay behind, not in front of, the camera. “Acting was not my path,” Robbins says. “I didn’t want to be in my 50s auditioning for guest spots on ‘CSI.’”
After “Head of the Class” ended in 1991, Robbins began directing and producing. He made the influential 1995 music documentary “The Show,” but his real talent was his ability to sense what younger viewers wanted to watch. And in the early ’90s, those kids were looking for their own version of “Saturday Night Live,” so Robbins and his producing partner Mike Tollin created “All That,” a sketch-comedy show starring teenagers that aired on Nickelodeon. That’s where he got the idea to take two of the show’s breakout stars, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, and shoot a low-budget movie called “Good Burger” about two high school fast-food workers. Paramount executives loved the idea, and when they asked who was directing the picture, Robbins pitched himself, despite having never made a feature film.
“The second I got back to my office, I turned to my assistant and said, ‘The good news is we’re making a movie. The bad news is I have to act like I know what I’m doing,’” Robbins says.
“Good Burger” was a hit, grossing $23.7 million on its $8.5 million budget, and Robbins was in demand. He used that clout to direct a range of films, including the football drama “Varsity Blues” and a remake of “The Shaggy Dog.” Because he’d spent years acting, Robbins had a knack for identifying promising young talent and coaxing performances from them.
“Brian was the first director who spoke to me as an actor,” says Michael B. Jordan, who had one of his early roles in “Hardball,” a sports drama that Robbins directed. “He helped me tap into what a fictional character would be feeling.”
Robbins also formed bonds with actors that outlasted the movies they made together. “Brian was like a second dad,” Thompson says. “He taught me the ropes. He always told me that when you go into meetings, you can’t be your normal relaxed self: ‘Sell a version of yourself that’s more exciting.’”
Dylan Coulter for Variety
Directing proved draining, requiring Robbins to be away from his family for long stretches of time. In 2009, as he was trying to figure out his next move, he noticed that his sons were growing more engrossed by YouTube than movies or TV. One of their favorite shows focused on Fred, a hyperactive teenager played by Lucas Cruikshank, which inspired Robbins to take that character and make a movie about him. To get it off the ground, he invested $1 million of his own money, eventually signing a deal to have it premiere on Nickelodeon, where it was a ratings hit.
“It proved I could be entrepreneurial,” Robbins says. It also left him wanting to move more aggressively into the emerging medium. So he came up with the idea for AwesomenessTV, a startup targeting tween YouTube users. “He saw where the audience was going before most people did,” says UTA chief Jeremy Zimmer, Robbins’ former agent.
Awesomeness eventually sold to DreamWorks Animation, and when DreamWorks Animation was itself sold to Comcast in 2017, Robbins left the company. That’s when he was approached by Paramount to run Paramount Players, a label making mid-budget comedies and dramas. It was a short 16-month stint before he was promoted to oversee Nickelodeon, which was struggling to recapture its 1990s dominance. But an even bigger job awaited.
Paramount Global chairwoman Shari Redstone, who had urged Robbins to take the job at Nickelodeon, says she became convinced that he was the right choice to reinvigorate Paramount. She wanted the studio to have a different vision. “Brian did not have the typical résumé,” she says. “He has his own way of looking at the business. I want us to be moving and changing and looking at the future, and I feel like Brian is making sure we don’t get left behind.”
Since taking over Paramount in 2021, Robbins has pushed the film team to work more closely with other divisions of Paramount Global. “If you look at our success, we made some great movies, but we marketed the living hell out of them,” he says. “And that’s because I did what no one else at Paramount had done. There was a moat around the studio, and I pulled up the drawbridge and said we’re going to work across the company.”
So that’s why CBS viewers were treated to an appearance by “Top Gun: Maverick” star Tom Cruise on an AFC Championship Game broadcast or audiences on MTV were offered a marathon of “Scream” movies in the lead-up to the latest sequel’s release. When we meet in July at “CBS Mornings,” Robbins isn’t there to be interviewed by Gayle King. He’s observing how the program is handling “Mission: Impossible” week, which has seen cast members stop by to enthuse about making the latest installment. All that cross-promotion is supposed to help “Mission: Impossible” achieve a cultural ubiquity that’s hard to pull off in a fractured media landscape.
The release of “Dead Reckoning Part One” marks the end of a turbulent production and a crisis that Robbins inherited on his first day on the job. The studio was at an impasse with Cruise and McQuarrie about the sequel’s runaway budget, which ultimately ballooned to nearly $300 million due to COVID shutdowns, and the filmmakers’ desire to add an expensive sequence involving a Russian submarine. That scene was originally slated to appear in the next installment, but Cruise and McQuarrie believed it was necessary to include earlier in the two-part story. However, the cost had to be assumed wholly by Paramount, because Skydance Media, which co-financed the movie, had a contract requiring the studio to assume overages beyond $240 million. Robbins avoids specifics, but admits things got thorny. “Let’s just say that the studio and the production and Tom were in a disagreement over direction, and there was a stalemate going on,” Robbins says. “We had to hit the pause button. They were stuck on how they were going to move forward with ‘Dead Reckoning Part Two’ while finishing ‘Part One.’”
So, I ask, was the disagreement over money? “It was a production issue, and it was about the scope of what was being asked for,” he says. “And the question we needed to ask was do we need this and why? And then how big is it going to be, and how long is that going to take?”
Appeasing Cruise wasn’t the only thing Robbins had to worry about in those early days. He was savaged in the press, partly because he was promoted as Gianopulos, a well-respected executive who had led Paramount since 2017, was pushed out.
Because Robbins had been an early advocate of YouTube, creating AwesomenessTV to make content for the platform, many assumed that he had sold Shari Redstone on a vision of dismantling the studio’s theatrical slate and sending everything to its streaming service. But the opposite is true — “Smile,” for instance, was supposed to debut on Paramount+, but after viewing a rough cut of the film, Robbins opted to release it theatrically. In fact, he’s primarily interested in making movies for cinemas, believing that the publicity that accompanies that kind of launch makes films more popular when they hit home entertainment.
“It was understandable,” Robbins says of the criticism. “Jim is a gentleman and a statesman of the movie business. The guy is adored — I adore him. He’s nothing but a class act. We live in a world where it’s easier for the press to get more readers by writing something negative than writing something positive.”
From Paramount this summer: “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One”; “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem”; and “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” Mission Impossible: Paramount Pictures and Skydance; Transformers: Paramount Pictures
Robbins downplays that time, but friends acknowledge that the blistering coverage stung him. (TheAnkler, a newsletter that covers Hollywood, branded Robbins “Norbit Man,” a reference to the critically excoriated Eddie Murphy comedy that he directed).
“You know what I said to him,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, Robbins’ friend and mentor, remembers. “Go back and Google what happened when Barry Diller was named CEO of Paramount. Go back and look at what the reaction was when Michael Eisner was named president of Paramount. Read about when Bob Daly was first named head of Warner Bros. For all of these greats, when they got their jobs, the reaction was harsh, skeptical and cynical. It worked out pretty great for them, and it will work out great for you. Just go do the job.”
It’s a glittering summer morning, and over breakfast Robbins and three of his most trusted Paramount colleagues are giving me a guided tour of all the reasons the movie business is so hazardous. The group includes Marc Weinstock, president of global marketing and distribution, as well as Michael Ireland and Daria Cercek, the co-heads of the motion picture group. The topic is why it’s so punishingly hard to make a movie these days. “You have to will movies to happen,” Robbins says. “The biggest problem with this business is people sit back and feel like a great movie is just going to come to them.”
That passivity has made studios reliant on sequels and superhero movies, often with diminishing returns. The past few weeks have seen new installments in long-running franchises such as “Indiana Jones” and “Fast and Furious” open to disappointing results, while comic book movies like “The Flash” failed to spark much interest. “There has to be a fresh approach to making franchises,” says Cercek. Ireland, looking up from a plate of Belgian waffles, agrees. “There needs to be a reason to make a sequel,” he says. “It can’t just be we’ve made six other versions of this same story, and here’s a seventh.”
Robbins calls it having “a big idea.” And in the case of the latest “Transformers” film, that eureka moment was to have G.I. Joe enter the robots’ cinematic universe, bringing together two of Paramount’s biggest franchises. But that required Robbins to convince Hasbro, the toy company behind both sets of characters, and producers Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay, to let the studio bring the worlds together. And Bay’s approval was tricky, because he was worried that merging the series would cheapen the other “Transformers” movies. “I called him 50 times,” Robbins says. “I would not let him off the hook. And when he finally stopped dodging my calls, we got him to sign off.”
Even with G.I. Joe’s firepower, the recent “Transformers” movie grossed a mediocre $427 million. “We feel it’s not great, but good” is Robbins’ spin. But the film’s struggles, he says, show the perils of a fading global box office. Russia, once the sixth-biggest market for films, has been closed off following its invasion of Ukraine. More consequential, China, which rivals the United States in ticket sales, has become an unreliable source of revenue for Hollywood films. That’s largely due to rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. In the case of “Rise of the Beasts,” the film grossed $90 million from China, half of what Paramount anticipated.
“China is a different marketplace,” says Weinstock. “You can’t count on it for a big number anymore, so everyone needs to reevaluate their budgets.”
Most summer movies carry staggering price tags. During COVID, many of these productions saw costs escalate by tens of millions of dollars. And though pandemic shutdowns have eased, inflation makes it hard to economize. How, I wonder, will Robbins and his team make cheaper movies?
“It’s no one’s fault,” says Robbins. “COVID and inflation took the $100 million movies and made them cost $200 million. But movie tickets didn’t go from $12 to $24. We have to ask: How do we build movies? What’s necessary? We need to make smart choices. You can’t have everything, but you need that foundation to be strong.”
Years ago, studios could build their movies around movie stars, but Hollywood has done a crappy job of replenishing its cosmos of leading men and women. Instead, they’ve leaned into comic book adaptations, where costumed heroes are the draw, not the actors behind the mask. That makes it difficult to produce other kinds of movies, such as dramas and rom-coms, that rely on personalities, not superpowers, to attract crowds.
Paramount’s leaders want to invest in a new generation of talent. They’re developing “The Saint,” a remake of the Roger Moore spy series that will star “Bridgerton’s” Regé-Jean Page. And for the “Gladiator” sequel, the studio is teaming veteran actor Denzel Washington with the 27-year-old Paul Mescal, recently Oscar nominated for his work in the indie “Aftersun.” To see if Mescal could fill out a toga, Cercek and Ireland watched his performance in the West End revival of “A Streetcar Named Desire.” “He played Stanley, and there are several moments where he takes off his shirt and it was electric,” Cercek says. “The ladies in the audience were very vocal, and we were like, ‘I think we’ve found our guy.’”
Even a star’s ability to make audiences swoon isn’t always enough to guarantee that a movie will make money. “Babylon,” an epic about the silent movie era, collapsed at the box office when Paramount released it last December, despite starring Brad Pitt, while “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” will lose money even though Chris Pine led the ensemble. Robbins isn’t abandoning the idea of more “Dungeons & Dragons,” though if there’s a sequel, he says, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make it for less.” As for “Babylon,” that one hurt because Robbins believes in Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning “La La Land” director who made the movie. “It broke my soul to have ‘Babylon’ not do well,” Robbins admits when we meet for the first time in April. “There’s people who loved the movie and there’s people who hated the movie, but you can’t deny it’s an ambitious fucking movie.”
Costs may be rising while the box office is contracting, but Robbins sees areas of opportunity. He’s overhauled Paramount’s animation division, raiding Nickelodeon’s vault and jettisoning projects that he didn’t think were commercial. “Under the Boardwalk,” a movie about hermit crabs on the Jersey Shore that predated Robbins, will debut on Paramount+, not in theaters. “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,” he says.
Instead, the studio’s upcoming animated releases will center on familiar properties such as “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” which Robbins thinks will appeal to millennials who grew up with the shows.
“It’s not about Disney and Pixar anymore,” he says, noting that recent Disney films like “Elemental” and “Lightyear” have stumbled at the box office. “People are looking for animated movies that are irreverent and have a comedic point of view.”
Robbins and his team believe that they can successfully navigate an uncertain future for movies. But even the smartest executives or the most brilliant filmmakers and brightest stars may not be skilled enough to overcome the cultural and economic forces that are reshaping entertainment. Movies are enormous investments of time and resources, and with younger consumers growing more passionate about video games or social media, can the film business remain viable? Hollywood is already in a defensive crouch, with media conglomerates that once bragged about the billions they were shelling out for “content” now signaling they want to cut costs or sell assets. Analysts believe all this tumult could spark a fresh wave of mergers. So what would that mean for a company like Paramount Global and the studio Robbins runs?
“There’s a whole lot of uncertainty,” says Peter Newman, head of NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ MFA/MBA program. “Will more of these media companies combine? Or does someone like an Apple decide they want to take over a traditional studio?”
Back at “CBS Mornings,” Robbins looks like a man in dire need of an espresso as he rubs his eyes. He’s been out until 2 a.m., attending a lavish New York premiere for “Mission: Impossible” and then partying with the cast after the event. It must, I think, have required him to be always “on,” emanating the “exciting version” of himself that Robbins once advised Thompson to be while pitching studio executives.
Of course, Robbins is now on the other side of the desk, and that changes things. And part of his job requires saying no— rejecting a story idea or, say, informing Tom Cruise that he can’t shoot a sequence with a submarine (in the latter case, the answer was yes, because the latest “Mission: Impossible” kicks off with one).
“Delivering tough news is part of the job,” Robbins admits. “It’s about having a hard conversation. And hopefully, at the end of that talk, you still have mutual respect, or you find a way to come to a compromise. It’s not a fun part of the job.”
“Last night,” Robbins says, his mouth inching into a grin. “Last night was way more fun.”

As shown in this exclusive behind-the-scenes video (which you can watch via the player above or the embed below), teen actors Micah Abbey (Donatello), Shamon Brown Jr. (Michelangelo), Nicolas Cantu (Leonardo), and Brady Noon (Raphael) recorded together in order to establish the camaraderie among the Ninja Turtles. Voice actors traditionally record their roles by themselves.

“I think we go deeper emotionally than maybe other previous iterations. We really spent a lot of time focusing on the characters and making them lovable and relatable and feel authentic,” Rowe said.
IGN can also exclusively debut a slew of new character posters (scroll through the gallery below) featuring all the characters in the movie, including Seth Rogen's Bebop, John Cena's Rocksteady, Jackie Chan's Splinter, and Ice Cube's Superfly.
Mutant Mayhem marks the big screen debut for many TMNT characters, such as Mondo Gecko (voiced by Paul Rudd) and Genghis Frog (voiced by Hannibal Buress). Rowe said the classic toys were a big reason why they appear in the film.

“We included them just because they're cool, just because we like them. So much of my connection to the Ninja Turtles was the original toy line, and I remember the back of toy packages having 20 different mutants on it, and each design was so inventive and creative and told a little story about the character that when we were designing characters for the movie, we're like, ‘Well, let's see what this character looks like. Let's try this.’ And then we started writing them into the movie just because they looked cool.”
Speaking of looking cool, Mutant Mayhem’s animation style is distinct from past incarnations of TMNT as well as from the signature styles of Disney-Pixar and DreamWorks Animation. Rowe credits the critical and commercial success of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse for convincing Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies to let them try a new approach to visualizing the Ninja Turtles and their world.
“It incentivized studios to take risks that being visually different and unique is a benefit critically and financially, and it really opened a lot of doors for other films,” Rowe said.

2023-07-07 13:00:00+00:00,TMNT director teases that Shredder will appear in future movies,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem co-director Jeff Rowe says he'd be ""100%"" down to make a sequel in new SFX interview","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character Shredder might not be in Mutant Mayhem but he'll definitely show up in future movies, says co-director Jeff Rowe. If the new animation spawns a franchise, that is...
""We'll Dark Knight it,"" Rowe jokes to SFX magazine in the new issue, which features Good Omens season 2 on the cover, before adding that he'd ""100%"" love to develop a sequel. ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""
In TMNT lore, Shredder is the archenemy of the titular Turtles' mentor Splinter, who is voiced in the new film by Jackie Chan. Various iterations of the character, who is most often known as Oroku Saki, have have been depicted over time, including human and non-human, as well as both male and female.
As you might expect, Mutant Mayhem centers on righteous reptilians Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, as they set out to win the hearts of their fellow New Yorkers, after years of being sheltered from the human world. Alongside their new friend, April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the anthropomorphic foursome attempt to take down a mysterious crime syndicate, but find themselves in over their shells when they become the target of an army of mutants.
Seth Rogen, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, John Cena, and Paul Rudd are among the star-studded voice cast. It releases on August 4.

Referencing how the Turtles are very rarely adolescents whenever a new version of the 1980s cartoon rolls around, Rowe, who helmed the movie with Kyler Spears, told SFX: ""We wanted a teenager to watch the movie and feel seen by it and understood.
""That was our cornerstone for everything, like making the Turtles not hulking, ripped versions of themselves, but lanky and awkward. That carried through into casting actual teenagers. It's insane that it had never been done before."" Here, the eponymous quartet are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr.

2023-08-18 10:47:26-07:00,Director Jeff Rowe speaks on putting the youthful energy back inside ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’,"The ‘Mutant Mayhem’ writer/director speaks about working with Seth Rogan on a modern TMNT story, the empathy that exists within the mutants, and more.","I had various entry points concerning my long-standing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fandom. There was, of course, the 1990 live-action film, the Saturday morning cartoon with the infectious opening song, and the Nintendo and arcade games. We’ve been through decades of Ninja Rap, reboots and remakes, and larger-than-life costumes. With a beloved franchise such as this, it’s a formidable challenge to approach it without leaning on the things we already know.
That’s where Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem comes in. Films like the Spider-Verse series that animation can be the fertile ground for innovative artistic endeavors and engaging stories simultaneously. Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael have the personalities and familiarity of the characters you’ve known in the past. However, writer/director Jeff Rowe, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and others devised the novel approach of leaning into the teen aspect.
These turtles talk like young people you would know, molded by the sights and sounds of New York City, and exist with a friendship that makes it seem like the cast has been friends for years. It gives a fresh and vibrant feel to a story fans young and old know through decades. That’s coupled with a story of wanting to belong, figuring out your place within the world, and why fitting in feels better when you do it for the right reasons.
I spoke with Rowe about his approach to this classic property and the youthful exuberance Mutant Mayhem brings.
DraftKings Network: One of the prominent things that stood out to me when I watched Mutant Mayhem is how the turtles felt like teenagers. It’s in how they look and interact with each other. In past stories, there’s a suspension of disbelief because even when we’re told they are teenagers, the early 90s films had these life-like suits that resembled grown-ups. How did you arrive at doing this different approach?
Jeff Rowe: That was the thing that got me excited about the project. Seth Rogan’s big idea was, “We have to cast real teenagers,” I said, “That’s crazy. Kids can’t act, right?” That’s the old Hollywood adage – never work with kids or animals. But then I thought about it for 30 seconds and said, “No, that’s great.” So much of what Seth and Evan [Goldberg0 have done has always relied on authenticity
If you look at Superbad, Jonah Hill, and Michael Cera did not look the glamorous cast of a CW TV show about teenagers. They felt relatable – like real people you knew and went to high school with. That’s such a refreshing take on the Turtles, who have always been played by grown men and sounded adult. We did this huge casting search, and I watched hundreds and hundreds of auditions. Then we found Micah [Abbey], Brady [Noon], Nick [Cantu], and Shamon [Brown Jr.]. They’re so funny and likable, and their chemistry together is so appealing.
It became immediately apparent that was the movie. We have to write specifically to their voices and who they are as teenagers. We have to record them all simultaneously to catch them talking to each other, sharing YouTube videos, and just being teens with each other. The movie almost took on a documentary-style approach to filmmaking. It’s so different from what’s done and the majority of animation.
In all my years of watching the many iterations of the Ninja Turtles, it always feels like they have a complete grasp of their various fighting styles. With Mutant Mayhem, we see them go through the training with Splinter, but with the fight in the garage, they have to stumble into their gifts to figure out what they are working with. There’s a difference between fighting in the sewer and actual hand-to-hand combat.
It’s more fun, I feel, as an audience member, to watch a character figure it out. We enjoy seeing Luke Skywalker learn how to become a Jedi. Part of the journey for the moviegoer is, “Oh, if they can get there, I can get there, too.” It helps you imagine a world where you can work through problems and get better at things. And it’s fun to watch. Part of that came from looking at many Jackie Chan movies as references for the fight sequences and how we would choreograph them and make them funny.
Jackie Chan is an amazing martial artist. He could kill me with his bare hands, but he’s so nice, he never would. Even though he’s so good in all of his movies, he’s constantly taking hits or at a disadvantage. He’s messing up as much as he is succeeding. It makes it so likable and funny, and I think we just wanted to give the turtles that level of reliability.
It could have been an easy slam dunk to place Shredder as the main villain, but the film takes a different turn. Superfly and his fellow band of mutants have been just as ostracized as the turtles and Splinter have. They share a father-figure bond but go about their anger in opposite directions.
With that going on, the shadowy figure of TCRI is looking to swoop in for other nefarious reasons. How did you balance all those elements and not elect a conventional antagonist?
The closest thing to like a real true villain in the film is probably Cynthia Utrom. It’s the corporation. It’s the system. If watching every season of The Wire multiple times taught me anything, it’s looking at the systems and the power structures as the villains – not the like street-level criminals who are just as much victims of that system as the turtles are.
Superfly is a victim because he experienced trauma and had a tough upbringing. He gets a little too extreme and takes it too far at the end, but t it was essential to us to have him be a sympathetic character in some ways. Also, in another way, have that connection to Splinter and help him grow and see himself differently.
I’ve discussed it in other interviews, but the movie's first draft was Shredder. We said, “Oh, we’ll do the turtles thing. We’ll make it a film about shredder.” However, having a villain who was also a mutant that could relate to the Turtles, and had a similar tragic backstory was much more valuable and emotional. It makes sense for the Turtles to think, “I don’t know, he’s kind of cool. Should we listen to him to have them not be wrong about everything?” That makes for the most interesting villains.
Another big key in how Mutant Mayhem presents itself is the revamp of the April O’Neil character. Here, she’s just a teen in New York who wishes to become a reporter and crack a story to get her high school prom back. She has a situation she must overcome, and it was a fresh take on the character – mainly from what we’ve known her.
The most important thing was that she needed to be a teen like them and be like “the fifth turtle” April needed to be able to give them shit as much as they were giving her shit. They all need to talk over each other and laugh at one another, and it needs to feel like she’s part of the unit.
It makes sense for April to be like a typical New York teenager, have teenage problems, and have things she’s embarrassed about. She wants to be accepted and find friends who are like her. Those are universally relatable things that meshed with what the turtles were going for. Ayo is so funny and brings such warmth to the character and intelligence. I love this version of April.
With the animation style, it toes the line between beauty and being rough around the edges. You can see it in the differences when characters go to Time Square and down to the sewer. There’s a very New York quality to things that go along with this origin story that makes the art and characters grow alongside each other.
We decided we would make a teenage movie, and teenagers are rough around the edges. You’re going through puberty, your body’s changing, and you’re figuring out who your friends are, what you like, and who you are as a person.
You don’t have it all figured out and often rough around the edges. The art style needs to support that and feel passionate and energetic. Those days when you’re so excited about sketching, it’s like you can’t keep the color inside the lines. But you’re also not doing a good job because you’re 16 and have no formal art training.
The process of that was encouraging the highly skilled, talented artists in the art team to be looser, sketchier, and more experimental. Many even worked on Spider-Verse and can do that slick, polished, cleaned-up style. The team took to it and enjoyed it because we were all making art like we did when we were teenagers again.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZGtuZXR3b3JrLmRyYWZ0a2luZ3MuY29tL3BvcC1jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvOC8xOC8yMzgzNzE5NC90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0taW50ZXJ2aWV3LWplZmYtcm93ZdIBiwFodHRwczovL2RrbmV0d29yay5kcmFmdGtpbmdzLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvcG9wLWN1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy84LzE4LzIzODM3MTk0L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1pbnRlcnZpZXctamVmZi1yb3dl?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This post contains mild spoilers for ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" so beware.
""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" as the title implies, features a plethora of mutant characters, and it's not just the titular heroes in a half-shell either. Led by Ice Cube as the villainous Superfly, there's a whole ensemble of mutants voiced by an all-star cast that includes Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Paul Rudd, and more. However, one of the more grotesque mutant baddies isn't voiced by anyone famous at all. And it turns out the marketing department made quite the snafu in highlighting Scumbug when the character was given their own individual poster during the lead-up to the film's release.
When the big batch of ""TMNT: Mutant Mayhem"" character posters were released, each of the posters highlighted one of the film's characters and included the cast member who was voicing them. In the instance of Scumbug, however, the poster merely said, ""Scumbug as Himself."" That's largely because Scumbug doesn't speak words in ""Mutant Mayhem,"" but instead the creature snarls, growls, and throws slime all over the place. However, this little identifier may now seem strange to anybody who has already seen the movie, because Scumbug is very clearly referred to as a female cockroach. In a forthcoming interview conducted by myself with director Jeff Rowe this week for /Film, he confirmed to us that this was a major mistake in marketing, one that made filmmakers ""furious"" behind the scenes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM1NTk5OS90bW50LW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tbWFya2V0aW5nLW1pc3Rha2Utc2N1bWJ1Zy1mZW1hbGUtZXhjbHVzaXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Won’t Have Any ‘Boring’ Scenes: ‘The Movie Is Crackling With Energy,’ Says Seth Rogen – Exclusive Image",The heroes in a half shell are getting a vibrant animated overhaul with a sketchy pencil-drawn feel. Read more at Empire.,"Pause any frame from the trailers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and you’ll see an image filled with artistic flourishes. The animated overhaul of TMNT, directed by The Mitchells Vs The Machines co-director Jeff Rowe and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, has a visual style all its own – with an energy you might immediately associate with the Spider-Verse movies, but bearing a distinctive scratchy, scrawly pencil style. Channelling both the sketchy, lo-fi energy of the original off-beat Turtles comics, and the youthful exuberance of its central quartet of characters, Mutant Mayhem has been imagined as a lead-on-paper doodle come to vivid life.
The result should be another animated movie this summer that pushes the art form in a new direction. “The film itself is permeated with this teenage energy – where you don’t stay in the lines, and you’re pushing harder on the stuff that you like, and you’re impressionably scribbling in the background,” Rogen tells Empire. And once they saw what was possible visually, it upped their writing game too. “We started to write to the animation style,” he says. “It needed to capture that – we can never have boring scenes, because the movie itself just seems to be crackling with energy.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbXBpcmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL21vdmllcy9uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS13b250LWhhdmUtYm9yaW5nLXNjZW5lcy1zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

It revolves around family, unity, father-and-son relationships, and harmony. Just like my Jackie Chan action movies, there's a lot of action, non-violence, and comedy that the whole family can enjoy. It combines adventure with my special character. I like my character, and I also like the four small Ninja Turtles. Each of them has their own unique personality,"" Chan said.

Directed by Jeff Rowe, the film's voice cast includes Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Ayo Edebiri, Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen, who is also a producer and writer of the film. This coming-of-age superhero comedy action film, based on the Mirage Studios characters of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, serves as the seventh movie installment and is essentially a reboot. Notably, the film has received high approval ratings, currently at 96% based on 178 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" director Jeff Rowe said that he learned lots of new phrases from the movie's Gen Z cast members.
Rowe and producer Seth Rogen cast teen actors, whose ages range between 15 and 19, to voice the titular turtles, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.
The cast — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Brady Noon, and Nicolas Cantu — recorded their lines together in the same booth in order to allow them to riff off each other.
In an interview with Insider, Rowe said that some of the conversations between the turtles in the movie were improvised by the actors.
""There's this very funny scene where the turtles are just talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. Like, 'Hey, we're gonna be like real New Yorkers. Get a bacon egg, and cheese sandwich.' And they're all like quoting different YouTube videos that they watch and they just go off for like a minute talking about that,"" Rowe said.

""We didn't script that. They just did that in between takes. I think they were just legitimately talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. And then they were like, 'Make sure you're rolling,'"" the director continued.

Rowe added: ""And then we just put that in the film. It's totally improvised and totally not planned. It's unwritable. I don't think you can write that.""
Rowe said that he and the producers had to check if the teens' conversations were appropriate for the PG-13 movie, especially when they used Gen Z slang.
""I learned what 'rizz' is,"" Rowe said. ""They would say stuff and then we'd be like, 'Cool. Just say it like that. Wait, is that offensive? Is that beyond PG-13? What? Okay. No? It's cool.'""
Rizz is short for charisma and is used in romantic situations when a person is able to effortlessly charm another person.

Leading this colorful charge is Ramsey Naito, a veteran animation exec with past stints at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Blue Sky and who, under Paramount CEO Brian Robbins, was appointed to be the president of both Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation.
“Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” sees Paramount join in what has become a very competitive market for theatrical animation. Disney and Pixar, once the undisputed box office kings, have hit a rough skid in the past couple of years while Universal and Sony have yielded hits like DreamWorks’ “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” Illumination’s “Minions: The Rise of Gru” and “The Super Mario Bros.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3JhbXNleS1uYWl0by1wYXJhbW91bnQtYW5pbWF0aW9uLWludGVydmlldy10bW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Thanks to the nature of the medium, actors in animation don't have to be in the same room together to share a scene. In most productions, actors' voices are recorded and edited ahead of time, and the animators add their physical acting after the fact. It's typically more common for animated productions to record each of their actors separately, then edit together a vocal track before the animation begins. Indeed, if one has ever seen a behind-the-scenes video of voice actors in a booth, one might see how recording lines can become very tedious as actors will have to repeat single lines over and over again until the director hears a take they like. It's quite rare for actors to play out entire scenes the way they appear in a final animated product.
In certain television shows over the years, however, that practice has been eschewed. Some producers prefer their actors retain their ability to play off each other, reacting in real-time, talking over each other, and generally lending a more natural performance to the show in question. This was famously done for shows like ""Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,"" ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""The Powerpuff Girls,"" and ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" all of which liked to gather as much of their cast as possible into one recording booth.
In movies, entire-cast recordings are all but unheard of, save for a few notable pairings. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, for instance, recorded their lines together for ""Toy Story,"" as did John Goodman and Billy Crystal for ""Monsters, Inc."" Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro shared a booth for ""Shark Tale."" And, according to a recent behind-the-scenes interview with executive producer Seth Rogen, the four lead actors of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (in theaters August 2) did the same.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM0MTk4Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmVjb3JkZWQtdG9nZXRoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is currently entertaining audiences of all ages in movie theaters and has opened to glowing reviews and impressive box office figures ($51.6 million worldwide to date, against a $70 million budget).
The film has an impressive assortment of heroes and villains, but it’s the latter that boasts the most where A-list actors are concerned. There’s Seth Rogen (Bebop), John Cena (Rocksteady), Rose Byrne (Leatherhead), Ice Cube (Superfly), Paul Rudd (Mondo Gecko), and Giancarlo Esposito (Baxter Stockman), to name a few. But with the exception of Bebop and Rocksteady, Mutant Mayhem is missing some major iconic villains.

In an interview with Den of Geek at San Diego Comic-Con, Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe talked about where things might go in the next movie, which, looking at the critical reception for the current film and, more importantly, the box office takings, is inevitable.
“I think a lot of people are gonna want more,” Rowe said. “These characters are so wonderful, this casting is so wonderful, you just love spending time with them. The Turtles’ world is a big one. There’s a lot left to explore. Conversations are happening, and it would be really exciting to let these characters keep on living and breathing.”
One of those conversations is undoubtedly centered around the Turtles’ iconic arch nemesis.

Warning: there are major spoilers ahead for Mutant Mayhem!
During a mid-credits scene, the Ninja Turtles, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), are adjusting to life at Eastman High with their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri).
However, it’s revealed that TCRI head Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who earlier in the film failed to extract the Ninja Turtles’ mutagen-blood to create an army of mutant soldiers, has surveillance on our half-shell heroes. Before the scene ends, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder, who we see standing in the dark near Brooklyn Bridge.

In a recent interview with SFX magazine, when discussing whether or not The Shredder will show up in Mutant Mayhem 2, Rowe jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger), who was missing from the first film in the series, Batman Begins (2005).
Fans hungry for another slice of Ninja Turtles won’t need to wait long, though. Paramount has already greenlit a 2D animated series for Paramount+ later this year, titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2023), that will follow on from Mutant Mayhem, as part of a planned TMNT shared universe.

The mid-credits scene confirms that The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2. He may even show up in the 2D animated series, but it’s likely Nickelodeon will want to save the silver samurai for the silver screen.
While The Shredder is a somewhat exhausted villain, we’ve no doubt that the “Mutant Mayhem-verse” will offer a fresh take on the character, just as the first film has done with its roster of mutants. But which other iconic villains from the wider TMNT universe do we need to see in the sequel?
The Shredder
Many fans would argue that you can’t have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (or show) without The Shredder, the franchise’s most iconic villain. But Oroku Saki was actually killed off in the first volume of the original Mirage Studios comic books in the ’80s.
Be that as it may, the 1987 cartoon series immortalized the character, as he went on to appear in numerous iterations on the small screen, in comic books, video games, and four out of seven of the theatrical movies (not counting Mutant Mayhem‘s mid-credits scene).
Now that we know The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2, it’s high time for something very different. While the Michael Bay-produced 2014 live-action film gave us a “Transformer” version of the character, we’re hoping for something a bit more subtle.
Related: All 12 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Explained (Yes, 12!)
The Foot
You can’t have The Shredder without the Foot (known also as the Foot Clan or the Foot Soldiers). His legion of ninja followers are often depicted as wearing black bodysuits to blend in with the dark, and with large, bug-like eyes on their masks (a bit like Spider-Man).
The Foot are hardly the front and center of TMNT‘s extensive rogues gallery, but they’re just as iconic as The Shredder, largely because they’re so heavily associated with him. Assuming Mutant Mayhem‘s version of The Shredder is a ninja, then the Foot are a no-brainer.
In the mid-credits scene, we only see the side of The Shredder’s helmet, and the spikes on his shoulder pad. He certainly looks like a ninja, but whether or not he’s Oroku Saki remains to be seen. But as Splinter (Jackie Chan) isn’t the Hamato Yoshi version, who shares a history with Saki, it’s unlikely.

Krang
For many fans, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) remains a bit of a mystery. This is understandable, because Mutant Mayhem doesn’t reveal much about her, other than the fact she heads up TCRI, and wants the Turtles’ blood to create super-soldiers.
In the mid-credits scene, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder to help her capture the Turtles now that they’re in high school and surrounded by people, as opposed to living in the shadows. But who is Cynthia Utrom?
Well, we know the word “Utrom” is the name given to Krang’s species — yes, the Krang, from the many cartoons and comic books and live-action movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) — and we know that they love to make mutant armies.
Cynthia Utrom’s human form is probably a robot, with a Krang operating from the inside, who is most likely female, especially when you consider that the mutants Leatherhead (Rose Byrne) and Wingnut (Natasha Demetriou) are female versions of past iterations.

Baxter Stockman
While Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) already appears in Mutant Mayhem’s opening sequence, there’s plenty of room for him to appear in the sequel. The tricky part is that Stockman is (apparently) killed before the opening credits, but he could always show up in a flashback sequence, or some kind video diary footage.
The sequel may even reveal that Superfly (Ice Cube) is the same person as Baxter Stockman. In previous iterations of TMNT, Baxter is Superfly, as part of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like mutation storyline, however, in Mutant Mayhem, both characters are entirely separate. As far as we’re told anyway, as Superfly’s hair looks suspiciously similar to Baxter’s.

Casey Jones
We know what you’re thinking: Casey Jones isn’t a villain. But Mutant Mayhem doesn’t appear to be following the TMNT playbook all that much. For starters, most of its mutant characters were born as animals, such as Superfly, Bebop, and Rocksteady, whereas in previous iterations they are humans who are transformed into mutant animals.
And don’t get us started on all the lore the film completely ignores, from Splinter’s backstory with The Shredder, which seems to have been thrown out of the window, to the fact that the Ninja Turtles end up in high school. A bold and admirable direction, for sure, but loyal to the TMNT mythology this film ain’t. This could work in its favors, though.
Casey Jones, the hockey stick-wielding vigilante, could be introduced a villain, which would create an interesting dynamic between Casey and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and in turn, the Ninja Turtles.

Due to the writers and actors strikes, the studio didn’t have Seth Rogen, who is both one of the movie’s producers and actors, nor any other voice stars. But it did bring out director Jeff Rowe and plenty of footage from the movie.
Twenty minutes of footage, to be precise. Rowe showed off a chunk from the beginning of the movie and, judging by the reaction, it went over gangbusters. The hall, while not packed in the usual way, still had thousands in their seats, and the audience was howling for the film, which opens Aug. 2 in theaters.
Unspooling was an introduction to the four turtle heroes, making a night run for groceries around town, deciding to catch a movie in the park (Ferris Bueller’s Day Off — a Paramount movie, naturally), and thinking how great life would be if only they could be liked by humans and have normal lives. What follows is getting grounded by their father, Splinter, a recap of their origin, an intro to the bad guy, and then their first meeting with human girl April O’Neil, which leaves a bunch of crooks messed up.
And while Rogen wasn’t in attendance, he did make his presence felt via two videos, one which detailed a quick history of the Turtles phenomenon, and another which, paired with Ice Cube (and said to have been made a month ago, before the SAG-AFTRA strike), talked about the movie in general.
Rowe, meanwhile, talked up how much the Turtles meant to him as a child. “It’s what taught me to be a fan,” he said.
And he said Rogen pushed for the angle of focusing on the “teenage” aspect of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, something he thought was underserved.
The film’s art style is a break from the shiny and polished look of many other animated movies, with the filmmakers making the choice to emulate an underground comic vibe.
“We looked at how we used to draw in high school, when you’re so passionate but you don’t know how to draw but you don’t know that you don’t know how to draw yet,” said Rowe. “So you’ll lovingly draw a hand, drawing every fingernail, every wrinkle, but the hand is horribly misshapen. There is no formal art training to encumber your pure expression. And we said, let’s do that.”
The panel wrapped with a surprise appearance by TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman, who announced that Nickelodeon and Paramount have secured the rights to the original TMNT animated series that aired in the late 1980s. He did not give details as to when and on what platform the series would appear.
“It’s been almost 40 years and I’m still drawing Turtles thanks to you guys,” he said, nodding to the power of fandom.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1jb21pYy1jb24tMTIzNTU0MDY3NS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1raWNrcy1vZmYtY29taWMtY29uLTEyMzU1NDA2NzUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Ramsey Naito: Paramount/Nickelodeon “Absolutely Committed to Making Original Animated Films”,,"In a brief interview in Variety discussing animation strategy, the new pic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and her own career arc, Nickelodeon Animation & Paramount Animation President Ramsey Naito clarified a statement made by Brian Robbins about the future of original animation at the studio which caused some uproar in the toon community.
In a cover story for the trade, Robbins was quoted saying, “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come.” Filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro and Christopher Miller — evangelists of the ‘animation is cinema’ message — took to social media to decry the implied abandonment of non-IP films.
Noting that Robbins was “one of the creators who really helped define the [Nickelodeon] brand” and his instatement as CEO of Paramount was a major factor in her decision to join the studio, Naito clarified that Paramount/Nickelodeon is not cutting original concepts out of its animated feature slate.
Acknowledging that “we [at Paramount] have to be careful about the concepts we decide to embrace for theatrical and make sure they are big and juicy and that there’s hooks in them,” Naito explained:
“We are absolutely committed to making original animated films and are in development on a handful of projects. Brian and I believe we are nothing without fresh voices, faces and narratives and it’s our responsibility to add new perspectives, modern characters, and vernacular to our culture of storytelling. Originals speak authentically to today’s audience, must be handled with care, and make their own mark in our legacy library… and hopefully stand the test of time. That said, we’re not a one-size-fits-all kind of studio and our budgets are designed to support the scope of our storytelling.”
For those curious about Nick’s mega-IP, SpongeBob SquarePants, Naito also shared that the SpongeBob Universe will continue to expand with more spinoff series and a raft of movies in the works for both Paramount+ streaming and theatrical release. Paramount/Nickelodeon has Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie directed by animation newcomer Liza Johnson (Elvis & Nixon, The Last of Us, A Series of Unfortunate Events [2019]) slated for 2024, and The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants helmed by veteran animator/SpongeBob comics story writer Derek Drymon (Hotel Transylvania: Transformania).
“The next one is going to be set in the deep sea, somewhere the series has never gone before. And the plan is that, like Avatar 2 or Wakanda Forever, we’re going to be immersed in this extraordinary underwater world,” Naito revealed.

So what does this rendition of the cult ’80s media franchise have going for it? Well, this take on “TMNT” sees Paramount team up with Nickelodeon and Point Grey Pictures (aka the production hub for Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and Jeff Weaver), with “The Mitchells Vs. The Machines” director Jeff Rowe at the helm. Sound intriguing to anyone else?
Here’s an official synopsis for “Mutant Mayhem,” courtesy of Paramount:
After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
A new animated “TMNT” movie wouldn’t be complete without a new voice cast ensemble to headline it. And that’s what fans get here, with Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, and Nicolas Cantu leading the way. Other voice cast includes John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Brady Noon, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, and Maya Rudolph.
As noted earlier, Rogen, Goldberg, and Weaver co-produce “Mutant Mayhem” through Point Grey. Executive producers on the film include Ramsay McBean and Josh Fagen. Kyler Spears co-directs with Rowe. Rogen, Goldberg, and Rowe also team up to pen the screenplay with Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, from a story by Rogen, Goldberg and Rowe & Brendan O’Brien.
So how will “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” fare with critics and audiences next weekend; better than 2007’s “TMNT“? With the major success of “Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse,” another CGI animated film, earlier this summer, maybe the latest rendition of the ’80s cult franchise fares better than the past three installments. “Mutant Mayhem” hits theaters everywhere on August 2.

Cube drove through his former stomping grounds of South Central Los Angeles with Carlson last month where they covered numerous topics including Barack Obama’s presidency, Black Lives Matter and the COVID-19 vaccine.

“I don’t believe in politicians,” the West Coast rap legend stated when asked if he’s ever donated to a political campaign. “Politicians have hidden agendas. They owe a lot of people a lot of favors. The more money you give them, the more you’re listened to.”
Ice Cube said he was proud to see Obama get elected as President of the United States in 2008 as he “didn’t think America would ever take that step” — but his enthusiasm didn’t last.

Greta Gerwig’s fantasy comedy added a remarkable $53 million in its third weekend of release, a decline of just 43% from its prior frame. “Barbie” has generated $459 million in North America and surpassed the $1 billion mark globally after just 17 days in theaters. It’s the first film directed solely by a woman to cross the coveted milestone.

Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” too, stayed strong in its third outing with $28.7 million, dropping only 39% from last weekend and bringing domestic ticket sales to $228 million. The R-rated historical drama has grossed $552 million at the worldwide box office, becoming the director’s sixth film to cross the $500 million mark. “Oppenheimer,” which has remained a force in Imax, landed in third place on domestic box office charts behind the sequel to “The Meg” and ahead of “Mutant Mayhem.”
Overall, it’s a rare weekend in which four movies earned at least $28 million between Friday and Sunday. As a result, the box office is 98% ahead of the same weekend in 2022 and 19% above the same weekend in 2019.
“A rare quadruple threat of $25 million-plus performers is driving another terrific weekend for theaters,” says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst.
“Meg 2: The Trench” opened in second place with $30 million from 3,503 North American theaters. It’s a decent start, albeit a significant drop from the original 2018 film, which opened to $45 million and became a surprise smash with $530.5 million globally.

The follow-up film about scientists who take on giant prehistoric sharks cost $130 million, so Warner Bros. is banking on another strong turnout at the international box office to offset its price tag. China Media Capital co-financed the film.
The good news is that despite terrible reviews and mediocre audience scores, “Meg 2: The Trench” has collected $112 million overseas for a mighty global start of $142 million.
“The drop from the first film’s start shows the series is wearing thin,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “But foreign is where ‘The Meg’ makes its money, and the overseas openings are strong.”
In fourth place, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” pulled in a solid $28 million from 3,858 venues over the weekend and $43 million over its first five days of release. The PG film will continue to benefit in the coming weeks from its “A” CinemaScore and 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. It cost $70 million, which less than recent animated offerings such as Pixar’s $200 million-budgeted “Elemental” and Sony’s $100 million-budgeted “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”
“We are thrilled,” says Chris Aronson, Paramount’s president of domestic distribution. “Getting to $43 million in five days in August is fantastic. It’s an all-audience film, not just a family film.”
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the creative team behind “Superbad,” wrote and produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which follows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo as they set out to conquer the streets of New York City after spending years sheltered from the human world. Before the film was released, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon announced the development of a sequel, as well as a two-season Paramount+ series that will serve as a “bridge” between the big screen adventures.
“Turning to animation […] opens up creative possibilities and broadens the appeal demographically,” Gross says.
Disney’s “Haunted Mansion” remake dropped to No. 5 with $9 million from 3,740 theaters, a 63% dip from its debut. The spooky film, which was curiously released in July, has grossed $42 million in North America and $59 million globally to date. It’s shaping up to be a theatrical misfire for Disney, which spent $150 million to produce the film and tens of millions on promotional efforts.
Elsewhere, A24’s low-budget thriller “Talk to Me” added a healthy $6.27 million from 2,370 screens its sophomore outing. With $22.1 million at the domestic box office, the film already stands as A24’s highest-grossing release of the year.

2023-08-13 12:09:46+00:00,'Mutant Mayhem' Actor Open to Returning in 'The Last Ronin' Movie - Inside the Magic,The 'Mutant Mayhem' actor is open to reprising his role in 'The Last Ronin' movie.,"This Mutant Mayhem actor wants to return for The Last Ronin movie.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is the latest iteration of TMNT in film. But unlike previous entries, this time all the focus is on the teenage aspects of the Ninja Turtles, while the film is easily the most family-friendly of all seven.
So, fans hoping for a dark and gritty take on the half-shell heroes, particularly those who are familiar with the ongoing comic book series, “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) from IDW Publishing, may walk away understandably disappointed.

While Mutant Mayhem is heavily marketed towards younger audiences, none of the films, or the numerous television shows, are geared towards adults, save for the original film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). But even that is quite cheesy in retrospect.
A genuinely adult-themed Ninja Turtles reboot, whether it’s on the big screen or the small screen, would definitely need to take a page out of the comic books, whether it’s the original run from Mirage Studios in the ’80s, or “The Last Ronin”.

“The Last Ronin” takes place in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City, where an older Michelangelo embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter.
A second series titled “Lost Years” (2023) is currently available, and it was announced at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con that a third series titled “Re-Evolution” is in the works, with the first issue available from December. The Last Ronin game is also now in development.

Recently, in an interview with ComicBook.com, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman commented on the possibility of a movie adaptation of “The Last Ronin”, while also sharing some details about The Last Ronin game.
Here are his full comments:
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take ‘The Last Ronin’ concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While The Last Ronin game sounds really exciting, unsurprisingly, when it comes to the big screen, Nickelodeon is clearly more focused on building a Mutant Mayhem shared universe. Not only has a sequel already been greenlit, a 2D animated follow-up series will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.
This isn’t great news for fans hoping for a live-action adaptation of The Last Ronin. Fortunately, The Last Ronin game will remedy some of that disappointment when it’s eventually released.

Either way, the popular comic book series is on the tip of everyone’s tongue, even when it comes to conversations about Mutant Mayhem. In an interview with YouTube channel Nerd Reactor, the brand-new Ninja Turtles actors were asked for their thoughts on “The Last Ronin.” Leonardo actor, Nicolas Cantu, who is clearly a fan of the comic books, was the first to respond, saying, “That is sick! That is sick!”
Brady Noon, who voices Raphael in the film, said to the interviewer, “You are the first person who has mentioned ‘The Last Ronin’!” before asking his co-stars, “Did you see the YouTube thing for it?”, referring to the popular fan film that imagines what a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” might look like.

The interviewer then put a question to Shamon Brown Jr. who voices Michelangelo, saying, “Let’s say, in the future, people love this [Mutant Mayhem], the reception is well, and people are like, ‘Oh man I want to see older Mikey deal with [the death of his brothers!'”
Here’s what the actor said in response: “I would be open to that, for sure. You know the voice gets deeper a little bit and, you know, has to get a bit more gruesome, but it’s going to be amazing. Hey, we’ll see. It could be five to ten years from now, you never know.”
“Are you going to miss us?” Cantu jokingly asked his co-star. “Cuz we’re gone in that storyline!”
While Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael are indeed dead at the time “The Last Ronin” takes place, they still appear in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, so there would certainly be room for Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey (Donatello) to appear alongside Shamon Brown Jr. They’d just need to be considerably older first.
Check out the interview below:
Even if The Last Ronin movie does eventually happen, it’s unlikely any of the Mutant Mayhem actors will ever end up reprising their roles, as Nickelodeon would likely want to keep the film as far from the Mutant Mayhem universe as possible. But who knows. One day, we could get a CG-animated Last Ronin movie as part of the “Mutant Mayhem-verse.”
Either way, who else could take on the role?
Who could play Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie?
Keanu Reeves
Keanu Reeves is no stranger to the martial arts, or taking down hordes of bad guys in neon-lit city settings as he sets out to exact vengeance upon a powerful enemy. If you’ve seen the John Wick films, you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Reeves’ gruff and somber voice would also be perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie.
Michael Shannon
Michael Shannon plays General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) and The Flash (2023), so he has plenty of experience with movies based on comic books. But it’s his role as Mr. Green in the comedy film The Night Before (2015) that oozes those “chilled out” Michelangelo vibes. More importantly, Shannon would bring a ton of grit to the role in The Last Ronin movie.
Chris Hemsworth
Chris Hemsworth also has experience with comic book movies as the God of Thunder, Thor, but we’re looking at his role as Tyler Rake in the Extraction films. Hemsworth also has the physique perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, and he’s also a great comedy actor, which would allow for the more “traditional” Mikey to surface from time to time.
Andy Serkis
Andy Serkis might not be the first actor you think of when casting a character like Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, or any Turtle for that matter. However, Serkis is the king of motion-capture performance, whether it’s Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, King Kong in Peter Jackson’s 2005 epic, or Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy.
Iko Uwais
Iko Uwais is hardly a household name in these parts of the world, but he might just be the most suited candidate for playing Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie. Uwais is best known for playing Rama in The Raid films, the adrenalin-charged Indonesian actioners. The actor’s mind-blowing fighting skills could prove an absolute game-changer .
Noel Fisher
There’s probably no better actor to play Michelangelo than, well, Michelangelo. It would seem unfair to give the character the motion-capture treatment again without considering Noel Fisher, who portrayed him in the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. The Last Ronin version of Mikey, however, would be very different to what you saw in those films.
These actors could even portray Michelangelo in The Last Ronin game, whether it’s through motion-capture performance or voice work. Unless Mutant Mayhem‘s Shamon Brown Jr. is confident about doing that deeper voice.
While there’s no film based on “The Last Ronin” in development, a trailer for The Last Ronin video game was released on Friday. Check it out below:
There’s no release date for The Last Ronin game. “The Last Ronin” comic books are all on sale now. The third series, “Re-Evolution”, goes on sale in December.
Mutant Mayhem is in theaters now. Check out the trailer below:

,Does Splinter Kiss A Male Cockroach In The New 'Ninja Turtles' Movie?,Conspiracies surround the marketing for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"Is Paramount covering up the fact that Splinter is gay in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie? That’s certainly the conspiracy theory flying across the internet.
This all started when YouTube movie reviewer Price of Reason went to an early screening of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — which premiered on Aug. 2 — and was angered that the movie portrayed the mutant rat voiced by Jackie Chan as gay.
In the film, a romance blossoms between Splinter and a mutant cockroach named Scumbag. “To add insult to injury,” he said in the video, “at the end of the movie Splinter is seen making out with Scumbug and then professing his love for Scumbug who he seemingly enters into a relationship with.”
You may be asking yourself how he came to this conclusion. Well, it’s all based on a series of movie posters released by ParamountUK that introduced audiences to each character. For the poster featuring Scumbag the text read, “Scumbug as himself,” meaning that Splinter was having a make-out sesh with a male cockroach.
“Now that in and of itself is already out of character for Splinter as we’ve known him for years, as it just doesn’t seem like something he would do,” he said. “But then later after researching the character posters for this movie and also consulting with Tom from Midnight’s Edge, I’ve come to the conclusion that they’ve decided to present Splinter in this movie as an LGBT character, a creative decision that I disagree with since he’s never been presented that way in the 40 years that this franchise has existed.”
Splinter is not canonically queer in any of the various movies, TV shows, or comics, in fact, little attention is ever paid to the talking rat’s romantic life. And despite the pronouns on the poster which imply Splinter has a gay romance in the film, Scumbag is portrayed as a female cockroach throughout TMNT: Mutant Mayhem.
The misleading poster has since been deleted from social media, leading some to believe that Paramount may have originally intended the romance between Splinter and Scumbag to be queer, but have since walked it back because of the backlash.
PARAMOUNT IS TRYING TO COVER UP THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY TRIED TO MAKE SPLINTER GAY! https://t.co/aJ8LrDscgw — MEAD The 4K💿 Master (Tom Connors) (@ThomasConnorsJr) August 2, 2023
In a recent interview with Slashfilm, director Jeff Rowe confirmed that the pronoun on the poster was incorrect. “We were furious about it,” Rowe said. “They put that out, I don’t know who did that or how that happened, but we were immediately like, ‘That’s not true. Don’t put that in the world,’ and that will now be on the internet forever. But that was never the intention. That was never the character. We always imagined her to be a female cockroach. And that one poster was a slip up.”
However, the poster was left up for over a month and the studio only changed it once a homophobic YouTuber started complaining. In light of the backlash and boycotts other companies have faced recently for including LGBTQ+ representation, it wouldn’t surprise us if a major studio changed their mind about having a gay romance in their money-making franchise.
But regardless of the original plan, it seems ridiculous that right-wing homophobes are up in arms about the sexuality of a cartoon rat and cockroach.

2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.
Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.
Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.
Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.
The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”
Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.
Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”
There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.
On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).
Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.
Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.
Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)
“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

2023-08-15 13:46:01+00:00,Why TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Didn’t Use the Iconic ’80s Theme Song,TMNT: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe opted to avoid the franchise's most iconic theme song to prevent alienating audiences.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe opted to avoid the franchise’s most iconic theme song to prevent alienating audiences.
Rowe broke down his reasoning during an interview with SlashFilm, noting that the inclusion of the music made popular by the original cartoon series would only have been appreciated by some fans and not general moviegoers. “It works for a certain crowd, and it works for a certain era of nostalgia for this franchise, and it’s exciting on opening weekend. But then, hopefully, this film is remembered longer than that,” Rowe said. The filmmaker elaborated that the addition of references to the past can result in a movie becoming unnecessarily dated by only appealing to a single demographic of fans.
“When you put those things in, it dates it, and I think robs it of being its own iteration, which was really important for us to make this just stand on its own feet and be a fresh reintroduction of these characters,” Rowe concluded. “So the temptation was there, but I always squirmed away from it.”
Shredder Takes a Seat
Not using the classic theme song isn’t the only major franchise staple Rowe opted to exclude. The director previously admitted that the villainous Shredder was meant to feature in Mutant Mayhem but he was ultimately cut to improve the movie’s narrative. Fans need not worry though as Rowe has confirmed the leader of the Foot Clan will plague the Turtles in the future.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is the franchise’s latest reimagining as it brings the Heroes in a Half-Shell into the modern era. The film’s unique animation style and heartfelt writing earned it plenty of praise from both critics and fans, with Paramount announcing plans to develop a sequel shortly after its premiere.

The peripherals themselves have been inspired by the green ninja reptiles (specifically the upcoming film, which is due for release on August 2), with four variations to choose from. Obviously, that means there’s a controller modelled after Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael.
As for the scent itself, the controllers come with a “built-in scent diffuser shaped like a slice of delicious New York ‘za.” No mention on what specific flavor, though.

,Seth Rogen Talks Remaking 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Starring Actual Teenagers (Exclusive),'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' hits theaters on Aug. 2.,"Everyone's favorite sewer-dwelling, pizza-gobbling, crime-fighting reptiles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, but this time there's one major difference -- the titular turtles are actually played by teenagers!
""They're often middle-aged men doing Teenage-Voiced Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" joked Seth Rogen when he sat down with ET's Will Marfuggi to talk about how a life-long love of the titular turtles led to writing and producing the latest installment in the long-running franchise.
""I was really the target audience for the first iteration of all this stuff,"" he explained, noting that he watched the TMNT cartoons and movies as a kid and was ""obsessed"" with the toys. ""My dad bought like, a big box of used Ninja Turtle toys at a garage sale when I was a kid, and so I had those and I played with them so much.""
However, Rogen admitted, ""I always thought that the 'Teenage' part of it was weirdly under-explored, you know?""
For his movie, the Dumb Money star added in more details about the turtles' desire to be just regular teens, and wanted the cast to be made up of voice actors that were closer in age to their characters than past iterations.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star Brady Noon, 17, is Raphael, the bravest and strongest -- but also most impulsive -- of his brothers, who wears a red mask and fights with two pronged sai weapons.
Paramount Pictures
The Amazing World of Gumball's Nicolas Cantu, 19, plays Leonardo, ""the leader and the most honorable and responsible"" of the turtles, who wears blue and wields two katana.
Paramount Pictures
Cousins for Life star Micah Abbey, 15, plays the ""wise and resourceful"" Donatello, who wears a purple mask and wields a bō staff.
Paramount Pictures
And The Chi's Shamon Brown Jr., 19, is Michelangelo, the heart and charismatic soul of the family. ""Mikey,"" as his brothers call him, dons an orange mask and primarily fights with nunchucks, though he's wielded other weapons throughout the years.
Paramount Pictures
""It's always [been] the same kind of energy, from the beginning,"" Brown Jr. said of stepping into a beloved role that multiple actors have played throughout the years. ""Mikey, personally, being like the funny one and you know, the loving one, I kind of embodied that in to this, just [adding] the modern day feel to it.""
Part of that modern feel, Rogen admitted, came from letting the core foursome improvise and inject some modern-day teen speak to make up for the old, outdated ""cowabungas"" -- which would feel totally anachronistic in 2023.
""I think it was so important that the freedom that Jeff [Rowe, Mutant Mayhem director] and Seth gave us and kind of the trust that they put into us being like, 'I think these kids know the generation better then we do as older men,'"" Noon shared, earning a guffaw from Rogen. ""I think that that was really important that we just had that trust and [knew] certain slangs that we can put into the film to make it better understanding for our generation.""
""Most of it was just Seth and Jeff giving us like, the reins to be crazy,"" Cantu agreed, recalling that Rogen and Rowe would often hear the boys joking around off-camera and ask them to recreate the dialogue in the booth.
""We cast them well and we just knew if they were essentially themselves, honestly, that it would convey the right dynamic and it would be the right energy,"" Rogen noted. ""That was like so helpful and it's why the movie feels natural, and I think why you stop thinking of them as turtles and you start thinking of them as teenagers within like, 30 seconds of seeing them on screen.""
For Rogen, it was an exercise in feeling a bit out of his depth as a writer.
""A large part of it was acknowledging, like, I don't know how these kids talk anymore,"" he admitted. ""When we wrote Superbad, we had such a handle of how 18-year-olds in 2004 spoke, you know what I mean? But now it's like 20 years later... We don't want to sound like 40-year-old men writing for teenagers.""
""I don't know half the stuff they say in the movie,"" he joked, teasing the cast, ""I signed off on it. I've heard since that it's really offensive.""
The film also stars Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rogen as Bebop, John Cena as Rocksteady, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito and Maya Rudolph.

2023-08-01 16:09:01+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Beg BTS’ Jung Kook Not to Watch Them Sing ‘Butter’ in ‘Mutant Mayhem’ Teaser,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sing BTS' 'Butter' in a teaser for the upcoming 'Mutant Mayhem' animated movie reboot.,"It’s right there in the name: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So, given that said bony-shelled reptiles are right in the demo, it’s fitting that in a new promo for the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that is out on Wednesday (Aug. 2), Leo, Raph, Don and Mikey are unabashed members of the ARMY.
“This is it, guys,” Raphael laments in the 20-second clip in which the foursome are lashed to a giant bomb-like device that seems to spell their demise. “Oh, so many regrets,” he groans. “I just wish I could see BTS IRL,” says Donatello.
Leonardo, of course, has a creative idea, offering, “We could do some of the songs for you,” he says, with Michelangelo adding that he’d be down for a few bars. Leo then gets the gang started, singing the first lines of BTS’ global No. 1 smash “Butter,” while encouraging the others to join in. But, given their predicament — they are lashed to a wall by their wrists and ankles — the song comes out as more of a cry than a croon.
It’s all a bit sad, honestly and Don complains that they don’t even really know the words. To be fair, the tweet of the clip had a very stark warning message: “Jung Kook please don’t watch this.”
In addition to the four turtles (voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon), the film also features the voices of Rogen, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph; Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote and co-produced the film directed by Jeff Rowe.

2023-08-04 02:20:34+00:00,The Bear’s Ayo Edebiri on being cast in Marvel’s Thunderbolts,"Ayo Edebiri, known for her breakout role in The Bear, italks abouther yet undisclosed role for the upcoming Thunderbolts movie.","Back in January, it was revealed that Ayo Edebiri, known for her breakout role in The Bear, was set to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe in an undisclosed role for the upcoming Thunderbolts movie.
Though Edebiri had not officially confirmed her involvement in the Phase 5 film, she expressed her excitement for the project and her journey in the MCU while discussing her voice role as April O’Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem in an interview with Backstage Magazine (the interview took place before the strikes).
Edebiri said, “I love being a sponge. I just want to learn as much as possible. I’m excited [for ‘Thunderbolts’] because I don’t know; and to me, that’s cool. I feel like those are always the situations that I’ve benefited from the most. If I don’t know what I’m going to learn, that’s the best possible scenario for me.”
As of now, there are no official details about Edebiri’s character in the movie. However, there have been rumors that she might be playing the liaison between Val (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the Thunderbolts team.
The current Thunderbolts roster includes characters like Red Guardian (David Harbour), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), John Walker/U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), and Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko).
Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine will be the one assembling the team, and she may also be partially responsible for the creation of Sentry.
Harrison Ford is set to replace the late William Hurt as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who might undergo a transformation into the Red Hulk.
The movie will be directed by Jake Schreier (Robot and Frank, Dave) with the script penned by Eric Pearson, the writer behind Black Widow.
Originally scheduled for production in June, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes caused delays, prompting Marvel Studios to announce the shift of the movie’s release date from July 26, 2024, to December 20, 2024.
Edebiri hits Bottom
Ayo Edebiri can also be seen in this month’s Bottoms a film that pays homage to David Fincher’s Fight Club. The story revolves around two queer teen girls, PJ (portrayed by Rachel Sennott) and Josie (played by Edebiri), who come up with an unconventional plan to lose their virginities to cheerleaders. They create a fight club as part of their scheme, with the intention of gaining popularity and recognition among their peers.
Surprisingly, their peculiar plan works, and the fight club gains traction. Soon, the most popular girls in school find themselves engaged in physical altercations under the guise of self-defense. However, as the fight club’s popularity grows, PJ and Josie find themselves in over their heads, realizing that they need an escape plan before their scheme is exposed. Watch the trailer below:
The film is directed by Emma Seligman, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rachel Sennott. The cast also includes Havana Rose Liu, Kaia Gerber, Nicholas Galitzine, Dagmara Dominczyk, and Marshawn Lynch, adding to the talent and diversity of the ensemble.
Sennott and Edebiri have previously collaborated on comedy series like Ayo and Rachel Are Single, showcasing their chemistry and comedic prowess.

2023-08-09 13:00:00+00:00,Ayo Edebiri Is Suddenly Everywhere,"Ayo Edebiri talks about her career, journey to starring on 'The Bear', fan theories, and new projects Bottoms, Theater Camp and Thunderbolts.","On a Saturday morning, Ayo Edebiri is discussing her first name. The restaurant required I put in my name for the breakfast order, a mundane request for most people but a potential point of distress for those of us with phonetically daunting monikers. The stakes are low if you’re a journalist but much higher if you’re a young actress and writer with one of the most electric careers of the moment — and a summer slate that’s poised to further cement her stardom. Ayo (EYE-oh) is a star of The Bear, FX’s restaurant-set dramedy that became a runaway hit last summer and returned for season two in June. She has film roles in Theater Camp, Bottoms and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem; makes a memorable appearance in the much-discussed first episode of Black Mirror‘s latest season, “Joan Is Awful”; and will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Thunderbolts alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Steven Yeun. Yet she still recalls (and sometimes still endures) the countless incorrect pronunciations. “I know that feeling of anticipating somebody being confused over your name well,” she says when I explain my awkward reaction to the hostess’ well-meaning request and aversion to correcting people. “But we might as well try.”

Edebiri, open, warm and quick to banter, has spoken in the past about having little in common with The Bear‘s Sydney Adamu, the earnest and occasionally vexing sous chef (and eventual chef de cuisine) to Jeremy Allen White’s culinary wunderkind Carmy, but it quickly becomes clear they share a fastidious attention to detail, a need to get things just right. “Sometimes when I do these interviews, I can tell I’m a writer because when I speak, it’s just a first draft,” she says of her tendency to correct herself or cast around for the best turn of phrase. “I’m deleting and editing in real time.” (A member of both the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, Edebiri spoke with THR before the actors guild called a strike on July 13.)
Another similarity: Both Sydney and Ayo seem to know everyone in the local restaurant scene. Shortly after we’re seated in a corner table at All Time, a trendy café south of Griffith Park where the menu is scrawled onto butcher paper nightly, she recognizes several people. We’ve barely made a dent in our respective bowls of yogurt and chia-forward granola when she spots a table full of friends from the neighborhood. She stops to chat with a runner who also works at Little Dom’s, the ever popular Italian joint up the street. Later, when we’re at Dinosaur Coffee, the baristas around the counter ask about her dog, Grommet, and her vacation plans; there’s a facetious request to bring back some clothes from Paris Fashion Week (“No, yeah, I’ll definitely think about it,” she deadpans). She’s made fast friends across the entertainment industry, too, finding her footing quickly despite entering a cutthroat environment without a single connection.

Edebiri, 27, grew up in what she describes in her stand-up act as the “gorgeous Caucasian haven of Boston, Massachusetts,” an only child of immigrant parents (her father is Nigerian, her mother from Barbados) with a large extended family and equally large church circle. She remembers being social in high school, being good at school, being very involved with clubs and improv. “I was definitely dealing with a lot of hormones and undiagnosed things swirling around, but I was also very focused on sorting out my adult life,” she says. “I’m a future person, always wondering what’s the next move. I’m very rarely here.”
That future was New York University, where she enrolled to study education before ultimately switching to its Tisch School for the Arts (and the Dramatic Writing program) once she decided to give herself entirely over to her show business aspirations. She worked multiple jobs in addition to the coursework and her near-nightly stand-up shows, moonlighting as a nanny, a barista and (as is The Bear canon by now) in restaurants, including Jean-George Vongerichten’s ABC Kitchen. The school introduced her to a cadre of fellow strivers in an environment she describes as similar to a conservatory: “Writing was all I could think about — I was in the deep end.”
Edebiri had a plan to break into the business. She was going to give herself three to four years to get a writers assistant job and then another four years to get staffed. Cold emails to reps led nowhere. Instead, her manager found her after reading a humor piece she had co-written for The New Yorker (“So You Want to Date a New York Museum”) and eventually came to see her act.
Edebiri’s first entertainment job was helping in the writers room of Franchesca Ramsey’s Comedy Central pilot (which never made it to air). She then flew to Los Angeles for meetings and landed punch-up gigs on various scripts. She was still performing in as many stand-up shows as she could manage, and the right people started to take notice. “I had no framework for this kind of career,” she says, “but I think a little bit of delusion is healthy here. Because we’re doing a delusional thing. A career in the arts? It’s delusional.” By 2019, she was living in Los Angeles and writing on Sunnyside, the one-season-long NBC comedy created by Kal Penn, and she joined rooms for Dickinson and Big Mouth soon after — all according to her plan, but much, much faster.
Edebiri wrote on Big Mouth and later voiced the geeky teenager Missy, after Jenny Slate stepped down during the summer of 2020 amid controversy over her voicing a mixed-race character as a white actress. On Dickinson, the Apple TV+ series reimagining Emily Dickinson’s early days, she was hired as a writer and was later cast as the supporting character of Hattie, a maid and friend of Hailee Steinfeld’s titular poet. She always had an eye toward performing and says that she has adapted her career plan accordingly. “I’m now always checking in with myself and giving myself space for my goals to shift as my life shifts,” she says, also noting that she can be coy with the way she articulates her creative desires. “Even if I’m phrasing things in a way like, ‘I don’t know what I want,’ it’s because I know.”
It was while on Dickinson that Edebiri met Christopher Storer, who directed two of Edebiri’s episodes. At the time, he was still developing the show that would become The Bear. When it came time to cast it, he quickly thought of Edebiri for Sydney.

The Bear changed everything. The series, about an award-winning chef who returns to Chicago to salvage the family restaurant after his brother’s suicide, was a sleeper hit last year and earned nearly universal critical acclaim. It launched several (overlapping) fandoms — the earliest, and often the loudest, revolves around the internet’s obsession with and babygirlification of White as Carmy, the tortured and tattooed bad boy with a heart of gold (sort of), but a close second was Edebiri’s performance as the hyper-driven Sydney. Earlier this year, White won the Golden Globe, and Edebiri took home a Spirit Award for best supporting performance in a new scripted series. In July, they were both nominated for Emmys (in addition to the show’s outstanding comedy series nod).
Season two follows the crew of the cult sandwich shop The Beef as they struggle through attempts to flip the restaurant into a fine-dining establishment, a process that opens up the storylines of the whole ensemble and complicates the emotionally charged relationship between Carmy and Sydney. Their dynamic as professional partners is stress-tested by the horrors of opening a new restaurant (red tape, budget woes, mold, oversalting a test dish) and by Carmy’s budding romance with an old friend (played by Molly Gordon, co-director and co-star of Theater Camp). After all 10 episodes dropped on June 22, the premiere became the most watched FX show on Hulu (the networks won’t release streaming numbers but noted that the audience was 70 percent higher than the first season during the same time frame).
Edebiri is not involved in writing The Bear, though Storer has shared his plan for a third season with her — she won’t tell me what it involves, only that it “makes sense” to her. “I guess I want Syd to keep pushing,” she says.
She’s also been made aware of the (seemingly) sizable group of Carmy-Sydney shippers that have appeared, rising from the Twitter mist to declare their allegiances to an imaginary romance. These fan theories are something of a pain point for Edebiri, who says she is grateful that people are so engaged with the show, but that it’s “frustrating.” She adds: “It’s really not our thought process when we’re making the show, and I understand it can be part of a show’s culture — but I don’t think they’re going to get what they want.” Gordon told THR that while she also doesn’t subscribe to the shipper theories, she believes it’s a testament to the work of Storer, White, and Edebiri that they’re able to create something so passionate. “I think it’s incredibly cool to have this dynamic onscreen that isn’t romantic, but that feels charged and sexy,” she said.
Narratively speaking, Edebiri isn’t actually sure that Carmy should be in a relationship with anyone (“It’s TV, do you want to see Walter White go to therapy and then reunite with his family?” she asks with a laugh), but admits that she can’t resist falling — platonically! — for the character’s complicated charms. “I love this little fucked up guy in the kitchen,” she says before quickly self-editing. “Or wait, this messed-up guy.” (The more she reads her own interviews, the more she sees her own explicit language: “I think I do it when I’m telling a joke, like I’m putting a swear in there to let you know I’m saying a joke — it’s something for me to reflect on.”)
At this point, I remember — and bring up — a tweet I saw recently, that drew a line between the many years that Succession fans spent caring (deeply) about the show’s (deeply) damaged men and the way they were able to quickly jump to the stage of “babygirlifying” the men of The Bear. She looks aghast, the parasocial implications a step too far even for someone from her inherently online cohort. “That is so Internet,” she manages, her expression a flash of the face-acting that has become a hallmark of her Emmy-nominated performance.
As The Bear’s main characters went on their own journeys this season, it created moments of quiet — a creative pivot that felt rewarding to the viewer but often lonely for its actors, who grew to love the fast-paced, raucous, highly choreographed scenes in The Beef’s back-of-house. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays hotheaded “cousin” Richie, previously told THR that he “mourned” the loss of those chaotic days, and Edebiri felt a similar melancholy while filming episode three (“Sundae”), which follows Sydney as she travels across Chicago for culinary inspiration. “It was just two weeks of shooting me eating food and being in the cold, and I was by myself and missing everybody,” she says. “That’s the hardest type of acting for me, where it’s like, you’re a person, by herself, being vulnerable. There are 40 teamsters around and I’m just by myself in front of everybody.” (But she did love that she got to contribute something from her own closet to Sydney’s wardrobe: that quirky little detachable puffer hood. “It’s sick,” she says with glee. “Next winter everyone is going to be buying this shit, but it’s fine. I’m happy I did it.”)

Storer brought back some of season one’s notorious chaos for “Fishes,” the flashback Christmas episode that offered a window into Carmy’s deep-seated trauma. The stand-alone brought in such heavyweight guest stars as Jamie Lee Curtis (as Carmy’s mother, Donna Berzatto), Jon Bernthal, Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, John Mulaney and Storer’s longtime partner, Gillian Jacobs. Edebiri does not appear in “Fishes” — she shadowed Storer on set as he directed the episode and was given a co-executive producer credit. She says Storer noticed her aspirations before she saw them in herself: “When I met Chris, he was like, ‘You’re going to be a director’ — I just said, ‘Cool, you’re directing my life, and I love it.’ ” She says she is indeed interested in more producing and directing work and was greatly inspired by Storer’s collaborative style. Watching an ego-less showrunner at work, she says, taught her that “you can be a director without being omnipotent; you’re not an almighty power floating in the sky with a little monocle and a megaphone, or whatever.”
Two of the other releases that make up this Summer of Ayo — Theater Camp (out now) and Bottoms (Aug. 25) — are helmed by close friends, part of a growing web of close collaborators. Edebiri met Bottoms co-writers Rachel Sennott and Emma Seligman while at NYU. Seligman later directed Sennott and Gordon in her feature debut, Shiva Baby; during filming, Sennott organized a “girls hang” to introduce Gordon and Edebiri. “She lost her credit card within the first hour of being there, so I felt like we were going to be friends,” Gordon recalls.

In Theater Camp, a mockumentary about a summer arts camp under threat of financial insolvency, Edebiri appears alongside Ben Platt and a bevy of comedy’s rising stars like Patti Harrison, Jimmy Tatro, Noah Galvin and Owen Thiele. Gordon wrote the part of an instructor who lied on her résumé to get the job specifically for Edebiri, relishing the idea of allowing what she saw as Edebiri’s “unbelievably wacky” side to flourish. The character that Edebiri brought to the screen vacillates between deadpan delivery and energetic outbursts, which feels reminiscent of her early stand-up work, and occasionally borders on the nonsensical, much like her social media presence. (See her Twitter bio, which identifies her — incorrectly and without explanation — as “Showrunner of The Kominsky Method, now streaming on Netflix, Vudu, and the ITV app.”)
The Bear’s first season dropped the day that Edebiri started filming Theater Camp with Gordon in upstate New York, offering a striking view into the actress’ range. “She can be messing around and goofing off, and then the second the camera rolls, she’s delivering the most dropped-in performance you’ve ever seen,” says Gordon.
Edebiri’s part in Bottoms was also written just for her. Seligman and Sennott had been working on the film — about queer teenagers who start a fight club at their high school to get closer to their crushes — since 2017, and once they decided to make the raunchy romp a two-hander, Seligman suggested their mutual friend to play opposite Sennott. Seligman met Edebiri at a party and remembers an inherent sweetness that she now sees reflected in the way she performs. “She was just so awkward and funny and nerdy,” Seligman says, “and had such a good handle on slapstick physical humor that you never really see in the alt-comedy scene.” She references an early bit from Edebiri’s stand-up where she does an impression of an emcee/hype man trying to work the crowd despite feeling debilitatingly sad; there’s also a moment from a landmark Comedy Central set wherein the comedian makes fun of her own brand-new, blindingly white Vans, punctuating the joke with a Molly Shannon-esque high kick.
As Edebiri recalls, she had to audition for the role that had been custom written for her. “I’m still slightly salty about it,” she says. “I don’t know who made me audition, but I passed.” Seligman recalls it as more of a chemistry read — a “box to check” for the studio (Orion) to give its blessing on the onscreen matchup between Edebiri and Sennott. The actress already had been cast on The Bear, but the show hadn’t been given the season order. “Her résumé was good and it was already obvious that her career had so much promise,” says Seligman, “but it was cool to feel validated that we all saw something.”

The day of our interview, Edebiri is flying to Paris to attend the debut Thom Browne couture show, which will also be her first-ever fashion show. The brand has a knack for tapping into the cultural moment — Browne’s Fall/Winter 2022 campaign featured Euphoria‘s Angus Cloud and Chase Sui Wonders of Bodies Bodies Bodies, and he has dressed Cloud’s co-star Maude Apatow as well as Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. “I wouldn’t say I’m totally comfortable in that world, but I’m learning it,” she says. “Right now, I’m like, ‘How should I be at a show?’ ” Though she’s often in the ultra-casual wardrobe of a Los Angeles screenwriter (today’s ensemble includes a denim jacket and sweatpants), she loves clothes, and her growing fame gives her greater entrée into the space. Recent press appearances have seen her in everything from heritage luxury brands like Valentino to ready-to-wear from Rosie Assoulin and Ernest W. Baker. She’s becoming something of a Browne devotee in her own right — she wore one of his signature suits when she accompanied him to the CFDA Awards, and he created the custom chef jacket that Carmy gifts Sydney in The Bear‘s season two finale.

Here at All Time, the morning has gotten a little away from us. We met at 8 o’clock on the dot so she can catch her flight tonight. After the Thom Browne show in Paris, she’ll shoot THR‘s cover, then pop over to London, Copenhagen, Minorca and Lisbon to see various friends. The trip came out of a realization that, during interviews, she was constantly asked questions like “When do you sleep?” or “When are you going to take a break?” without a good answer. She seems a little bit anxious. She hasn’t packed yet, and now the dog sitter is en route to her house for the handoff, and we’re still picking chia seeds out of our teeth.
We wrap up quickly — she’s barely touched her oat milk cappuccino in its handmade speckled-beige ceramic mug — and she drives us back to her house, Grommet balancing daintily on my knees. After Grommet is safely ensconced in the dog sitter’s car, we walk for more cappuccinos (iced this time), and the conversation turns to relationships. She’s on good terms with her ex, who is in the process of moving from New York to Los Angeles and will soon be another source of pet care (apparently great terms is more like it) and is intrigued by my own (relative) apathy toward marriage. “You could do a small party, which is my dream, even though it’s crazy because my family is so big,” she says. “If I ever had a wedding …by the way, literally, who am I dating?”
After we’re situated on the back patio of Dinosaur Coffee, a man approaches, bursting to offer his congratulations on Edebiri’s recent success. His companion quickly chides him for interrupting, putting her in the uncomfortable position of having to make this stranger feel better for having entered her space.
She has described a singular drive to enter the entertainment business as a writer, but given her seemingly fated pivot to on-camera work, I’m curious whether she ever stopped to consider if it would make her truly famous. “No, I’d be insane,” she says. “Some people are literally supermodels, so it makes sense that their life would change.” She didn’t imagine herself in the spotlight because that would betray the self-deprecation inherent in her comedy work, and now she’s having to make sense of phenomena like fans screenshotting her online film reviews from Letterbox’d (posting on the site is “supposed to be fun,” she says, “and that makes it not fun”) or being asked to do things like this interview.
I ask whether she enjoys (or tolerates) watching herself onscreen, and she explains that, for now, she’s able to “zoom out” and not get in her own head but that it will get harder if she’s ever the lead of a project. Wasn’t she essentially the lead of The Bear’s second season, I wonder? She begins talking about how the show opened up for all the characters and how much she loved Moss-Bachrach’s work, particularly in episode seven. “This deflecting,” she adds with a grin. “Do you like it?”
And then it’s nearly time to go — there are books to pack (David Grann’s new nonfiction) and shoes to ponder over (“What about a sneaker and a ballet flat?” she asks. “Those are two good shoes.”) She entertains a final question about Thunderbolts, the upcoming Marvel antihero film that, at least until the SAG strike, was supposed to start filming this summer and hit theaters next July, employing a deft evasiveness one can only assume is taught in some sort of pre-Marvel boot camp.
What can you tell me about Thunderbolts? I ask.
“I know that I’m in it, and I’m excited to be in it,” she says.
Do you have to keep your schedule clear in the meantime?
“I don’t know.”
You don’t know …
“I don’t know. I know that I’ve been cast.”
So you signed something …
“I don’t know.”
I pivot, remarking on how stressful that sounds — that most people would struggle with that lack of control.
“It actually isn’t,” she says. “You’ve got to embrace the unknown. That’s literally half of my therapy — it’s just my therapist being like, ‘Isn’t not knowing exciting?’ And I’m like, it actually is kind of beautiful. It’s kind of sick. I’m at a place where my life has opened up in all these different ways, and I’m trying to be there for it, to be an active participant in my whole life and be OK with making mistakes,” she says, then obliquely references her moment of ubiquity. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is that you have to rely on people. You can’t do this on your own. Sometimes I just ask friends to get a drink so I can complain, or to get a drink so they can tell me about their life and I can remember there are bigger things than this.” It’s a valid point, but this, it must be said, feels pretty freaking big.

2023-08-17 19:04:23+00:00,The Surprise Winners From Hollywood’s Summer of Toys,"The toy market is seeing unexpected trends following the release of ‘Barbie,’ ‘Transformers’ and other titles.","Marl Davidson has been selling vintage Barbie dolls for more than 30 years, and business has always been strong — with one notable exception. Allan, released in 1964 as Ken’s best friend, was so unpopular that he was discontinued two years later before resurfacing in the 1990s. For years, Davidson had zero luck interesting buyers in Allan — that is, until Warner Bros.’ smash summer hit Barbie, featuring Michael Cera as the awkward, colorfully attired sidekick. “Allan is [usually] hard to sell,” she tells The Hollywood Reporter. “You can’t get rid of Allan, seriously. But now you can’t have enough Allans. Allan came out the winner.”
This forgotten doll turned success story hasn’t been the only standout surprise during this summer of toys. As Hollywood’s emphasis on established IP has led to film franchises based around characters that originated as dolls, comic book characters and action figures (like Ninja Turtles or Lego Indiana Jones), 2023 has delivered unexpected results for retailers. Barbie, based on the Mattel doll that launched in 1959, leads the way for recent toy-centric titles — and the season’s theatrical features in general, having topped $1.1 billion globally. And Paramount Consumer Products touts 400 licensees for its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem film and 1,100 total for the franchise.
The boost is much needed after U.S. retail toy sales in 2022 slipped 0.2 percent from the previous year, according to research firm NPD Group, following a notable rise during the pandemic as families craved at-home entertainment. And toy retailers are grateful: Davidson sold a firstedition Barbie doll from the 1959 line last month for $20,000, and a collection on consignment went for $600,000. Additionally, eBay vp global collectibles Gene Cook tells THR that site users worldwide searched for Barbie more than 14,000 times an hour in the week before and after the film’s release, with Allan searches up 1,300 percent.
Other surprises linked to Barbie include the increased interest in Ken, whose portrayal by Ryan Gosling has been a fan favorite. “Ken has been outselling Barbie [because of the film], which is pretty interesting to us,” admits Don Kipper, owner of L.A.’s oldest toy store, Kip’s Toyland, who notes that Barbie sales in general have been up dramatically thanks to the movie. “Barbie has been a staple, of course, for many years since the late ’50s. But Ken has not, and Ken has surpassed her after the movie.”
Today, the latest development is the “Kiddult” trend, with toys not only going to children but also to teens and adults. “We are seeing adults who haven’t bought a toy in a long time; they may buy one because they are gravitating toward the Barbie movie,” notes Adrienne Appell, executive vp marketing communications at The Toy Association. Hasbro, which launched Transformers toys in 1984 and has seen them remain a top performer, reports that the line’s sales have increased 85 percent since the latest film’s debut in June. “The characters that are featured in the films usually rise to the top — along with some of the ones that are classic, beloved characters like Bumblebee and Optimus Prime,” says Tom Warner, Hasbro G.M. and senior vp global action brands. “It just halos the entire brand at the time.”
Even more than for toys, the comic book market correlates quite closely to the success (or failure) of a film or TV show. This summer, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse solidified Miles Morales as perhaps the most valuable character created this century. Before the 2018 original Spider-Verse movie, a collector could pick up a mint copy of Miles’ first comic book appearance (2011’s Ultimate Fallout No. 4) for less than $50. By the time Across the Spider-Verse arrived in June, it became a $2,000 book (it has since leveled out to about $1,600), per CovrPrice, which tracks comic book sales across the internet.
The new film also has propelled Spider-Man 2099 to new heights. Miguel O’Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), was a largely overlooked ‘90s character whose first appearance (1992’s Spider-Man 2099 No. 1) was a bargain bin issue and is now selling for around $200 in the 9.8 grade, per CovrPrice.
Just as much a part of the narrative of this summer’s releases are the surprising misses, such as a recent rough stretch for DC Studios titles that include the audience rejection of the Ezra Miller-starring The Flash, which collected just $268 million at the global box office against a $200 million budget before marketing, impacting toy sales for the project. “When you look at the Flash toys, the character from the movie that outsold everything else was Batman and the Batmobile,” says Jordan Hembrough, founder of the toy retail site Hollywood Heroes. “And it’s because people have this connection to Michael Keaton and his portrayal of the 1989 Batman.”
The same is true on the comic book side in terms of value of classic comics. “Flash books are down. Anything related to this film is kind of dropping,” says CovrPrice co-founder Matt Devoe, noting that part of what drives collectability is the promise of what comes next. (See: Marvel’s post-credit scenes). “The Flash film didn’t have anything for fans to take and speculate on. In fact, it’s led to a lot of confusion of, ‘OK, what is DC doing with their future lineup?’”

2023-06-26 12:00:58+00:00,Across The Spider-Verse's Success Helped Make TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Possible,Spider-Verse kicked down the door. What else will walk through it?,"Across The Spider-Verse's Success Helped Make TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Possible
It is an unfortunate fact that Hollywood is very risk-averse, particularly when it comes to animation. For years, the big studios would make rather formulaic films and try to replicate the success of anything that popped, from Disney and their musicals to DreamWorks and comedies with pop culture references a la ""Shrek."" After the brief moment in the late '90s and early '00s when ambitious sci-fi adventure epics like ""Atlantis"" and ""Titan A.E."" failed financially, all studios started doing visually similar 3D CG movies.
That all changed, of course, when ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" came out. Not that there weren't other movies trying different things, of course. ""The Peanuts Movie"" also delivered stunning 3D visuals with 2D textures, while ""Rango"" delivered photo-realistic animation on a level not even Disney was doing, inside a rather mature Western adventure. And yet not many people saw either of these, and neither received the level of commercial, critical, or awards success ""Spider-Verse"" received.
Since 2018, more studios have experimented with the art form, delivering visually inventive films like ""The Mitchells vs. the Machines,"" or ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,"" the latter of which also delivered a far more mature movie with higher stakes than any other DreamWorks movie at the time, with inventive visuals that deviate from the ""perfect"" CGI animation that audiences have become used to. It's not that they were trying to replicate ""Spider-Verse,"" it was that Miles Morales' tale opened the door and proved you could deviate from the norm and be successful.
The latest film to follow in these footsteps is ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" which debuted a work-in-progress cut at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival earlier this month to tremendous applause.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMyMDA5Ny9hY3Jvc3MtdGhlLXNwaWRlci12ZXJzZS1zdWNjZXNzLWhlbHBlZC10bW50LW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Ice Cube opens up about a potential 'Ride Along 3' as he gives an update on his 'Friday' franchise,"“We’ve been talking a little on ‘Ride Along 3,'” Ice Cube revealed.","Ice Cube is looking to add to his film portfolio as he gears up for the theater release of his latest movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
Today (July 24), “ET” released its interview with Cube, conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike. During the conversation, he opened up about the possibility of adding sequels to some of his hit franchises. In particular, he spoke about making another Ride Along film and gave an update on the future of Friday. “I’m in a situation [of] trying to get control of the movie where I can do it the way I want to do it when I want to do it,” Cube shared before adding, “You know, that’s been a task.”
The N.W.A. legend debuted Friday in 1995 with Chris Tucker as his co-star. He then created two additional films alongside Mike Epps, with the last one released in 2002. Since then, Cube has been vocal about adding a fourth movie but said he’s been met with resistance from Warner Bros., who owns the rights to the franchise.
Regarding Ride Along, which Cube starred in with Kevin Hart, he shared that there have been conversations about a third film. “We’ve been talking a little on Ride Along 3,” he continued. “We haven’t locked in on the right concept and the right place to take the franchise. We don’t want to just do it just to do it.” Cube added, “We need to do it, and it needs to be, you know, a standalone movie that works. We’re going to work it out. Kevin Hart, you know, he’s hard to find too.” The acting duo released the first of the potential trilogy in 2014, followed by the second in 2016. Cube is set to star as Superfly, a mutant villain fly in the new TMNT movie, which hits theaters on Aug. 2.

2023-08-06 16:30:20-04:00,Box Office Report for the Week of August 6,"Barbie crosses the billion-dollar mark, while Meg 2: The Trench eats away Oppenheimer's second place hold. Read more here:","Barbie has officially crossed the billion-dollar mark, making it the second film to pass this number this year, after The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Moreover, the movie becomes the first solo female directorial effort to reach $1 billion at the box office, reaching this milestone 17 days after its initial release. Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer is also holding out well and has crossed the $500 million mark this weekend. I doubt the latter film will reach $1 billion, but the two have broken several box office records in the Barbenheimer battle. However, the two films only helped themselves reach the records they set during this time.
Barbie remains the top film of the weekend, while Oppenheimer fell to third place for the first time since its release. Greta Gerwig‘s movie has grossed $53 million this week, while Nolan’s Oppenheimer came in with a $28 million tally. It’s safe to say that the hype for Barbenheimer is slowly dying down, but none of those films are dropping precipitously.
Several new movies came out this week, with Ben Wheatley‘s Meg 2: The Trench being the weekend’s biggest winner. While the film had a meager $30 million opening in North America, it grossed over $112 million internationally, giving it a worldwide cume of $142 million. I wouldn’t be surprised that another sequel gets greenlighted, even if reviews for this one were worse than the 2018 original. The movie benefited from the star power of Jason Statham and Wu Jing to appeal to a broader audience, particularly in China. Jing’s films Wolf Warrior 2 and The Wandering Earth 2 are two of the highest-grossing Chinese blockbusters ever.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem did do relatively well in a crowded marketplace, grossing $28 million domestically, with a total of $51.5 million worldwide. With a budget of $70 million, Paramount played their cards right with this one, and the reviews are excellent. It’ll likely hold up over the next few weeks as studios usually dump films they don’t believe in during the month of August. The paradigm shifted for January, but August has remained consistent, even in a post-COVID world.
Here is the top ten films of the weekend:
Barbie (Warner Bros): $53M (-43%) – 4,178 theatres Meg 2: The Trench (Warner Bros): $30M – 3,503 theatres Oppenheimer (Universal): $28.7M (-38.6%) – 3,612 theatres Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Paramount): $28.0M – 3,858 theatres Haunted Mansion (Disney): $8.9M (-62.7%) – 3,740 theatres Sound of Freedom (Angel Studios): $7.0M (-45.1%) – 2,975 theatres Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning – Part One (Paramount): $6.4M (-39.3%) – 2,370 theatres Talk to Me (A24): $6.2M (-39.9%) – 2,370 theatres Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Disney): $1.5M (-61.7%) – 1,190 theatres Elemental (Disney): $1.2M (-65.1%) – 1,160 theatres

In a new interview with Sky News, Rogen said the issue is that studios like Disney and Universal, who are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), and the unions have different priorities.
“The studios haven’t even spoken to each other, is what I’ve heard,” Rogen said. “So not only does it seem as though the writers and actors have a great distance to go when it comes to the studios, I think the studios have a great distance to go, probably a greater one, when it goes to them getting on the same page.”
He continued, “These are people who hate each other. To think that Universal has the same priorities as Netflix is insane. What concerns me is that they will be completely unable to bring forth a coherent and unified proposal because of their own infighting and divergent priorities.”
Rogen has been on the picket lines recently in support of SAG-AFTRA. He recently co-wrote produced Paramount’s new animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, in theaters now. The actor also voices Bebop in the movie.
SAG-AFTRA joined the WGA on strike in July, marking a historic dual strike that has since crippled Hollywood. It is the first time that both unions, the 160,000-strong SAG-AFTRA and some 25,000 WGA members, have gone on strike simultaneously since 1960, when then-actor Ronald Reagan served as SAG president.
Members of both guilds are fighting for the same issues: increased residual payments, higher salaries, and the regulation of artificial intelligence in filmmaking, among other concerns.
The strikes have caused a massive ripple effect in Hollywood. Late-night shows have been dark since the WGA strike began and the 75th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards were recently postponed to an unspecified date. Trending Hunter Biden Offers to Testify Publicly.

Earlier this month, Carol Lombardini, president of the AMPTP, reached out to Ellen Stutzman, the WGA’s chief negotiator, for a potential resumption of talks. It was the first communication between the two sides since May 1 when the WGA voted to go on strike. Following the meeting, the WGA confirmed the studios said they would increase their offers on a “few writer-specific TV minimums and talk about AI,” but did not indicate a willingness to engage in screenwriters’ issues and other proposals.

,Ayo Edebiri Talks Which Live-Action Marvel Character She Wants to Play,The Bear and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star Ayo Edebiri wants to play a superhero!,"Between The Bear, Abbott Elementary, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and the forthcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Ayo Edebiri is having a pretty epic year — and it sounds like she's more than willing to add a blockbuster superhero movie to that list. In a recent interview with ComicBook.com's Chris Killian to promote her role as April O'Neil in Mutant Mayhem, Edebiri was asked if there is a live-action superhero movie she would like to portray onscreen. This comes as reports have indicated that Edebiri is cast in a mystery role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Thunderbolts movie, although that casting has yet to be confirmed by Marvel Studios.
""I don't know,"" Edebiri said in our interview, which you can check out above. ""As a big X Men kid, I feel like if there's... I don't know. I don't think I'm cool enough to play Storm.""
""If there's anybody in that arena I get, you know, some powers,"" Edebiri continued. ""I could do things that make sense with my hands. I'd throw down. Yeah, I'm down.""

Who Is Cast in Thunderbolts?
If Edebiri ends up joining the cast of Thunderbolts, she would star alongside MCU veterans Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, Wyatt Russell as John Walker / U.S. Agent, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost, Olgya Kurylenko as Taskmaster, and Harrison Ford as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross.
""I just made a joke about [how] it's like Dungeons and Dragons, where you meet in a tavern and it's like there's a dwarf drinking a beer and then there's like an elvish figure over there, we all come together and then there's this ghost... it's not gonna happen like that, I don't think,"" Harbour told ComicBook.com in an interview at last year's D23 Expo. ""But I think that's one of the mysteries of the movie is what is their relationship, and as you say, there is a lot of exciting things as you wrap up the next phase in terms of sort of what their part of the whole universe is in this random, chaotic way. So, you know, we can't say too much at this point, but they're an exciting introduction of this team together again, that's going to be a lot of fun.""
What Is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem About?

Ware returned as ""Zombie Kid"" to promote the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.","Sixteen years ago, a young kid named Jonathan Ware made internet history. He was interviewed at a Waterfront Park in downtown Portland, wearing zombie face paint and had bleached hair. In addition to his unforgettable look, Ware left a lasting impression with his hilarious response to the reporter who prompted him with, “Jonathan just got an awesome face paint job. What do you think?” The stoic child simply said, “I like turtles.” And that was and it took for the internet to affectionately nickname him “Zombie Kid” and make his short video clip go viral. In anticipation of the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie, Ware made a surprise return—face paint and all.
This new video is set in the Waterfront Village of New York's Midtown. “We found the Zombie Kid a.k.a Jonathan! He still has an awesome face paint job and is here with the first review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” it says in the video's caption. When the reporter turns to the now-adult Ware, she asks him for his opinion of the new film, to which he replies: “I like turtles.” This was the same answer he gave in the interview over a decade ago. Ware even mimicked the deadpanned inflection he had as a child.
Paramount's remake of the viral sensation playfully promotes the new film, which will be released in theaters on August 2, 2023. If you “like turtles” then odds are that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will be the movie for you.
Sixteen years ago, Jonathan Ware became known as “Zombie Kid” in a viral clip.
Paramount brought Ware back as “Zombie Kid” to promote the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

2023-07-31 15:01:18+00:00,"'TMNT' Co-Creator Confirms Disappointing News for ""Last Ronin"" Fans - Inside the Magic","It might be a great week for 'TMNT' fans, but this is bad news.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will likely take theaters by storm over the next few weeks. This year has seen its fair share of blockbusters take a massive slice out of the box office, including Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023). However, it’s animated films that seem to be the dominant force of cinema in 2023.
Across the Spider-Verse (2023) caught $682.4 million on its web and became Sony Pictures Animation’s highest-grossing film, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.355 billion worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing animated films ever.
Needless to say, the CG-animated Mutant Mayhem stands a solid chance at success. The film is also being heavily marketed in a similar fashion to Barbie (minus all the many shades of pink, of course), which echoes “Turtle-Mania” from the early ’90s.
In fact, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures are so confident Mutant Mayhem will turn in a huge profit that they’ve already announced the film is the first installment in a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set to follow the movie on Paramount+ this year.
So it makes sense that Nickelodeon isn’t letting anything stand in the film’s way — not even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
It turns out Nickelodeon is king when it comes to the TMNT property, so much so that they appear to have already stopped another Ninja Turtles reboot from hitting the big screen, likely because it may interfere with the new Mutant Mayhem universe.
That reboot is “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020)…
What is “The Last Ronin”?
“The Last Ronin” is an ongoing comic book series from IDW Publishing, which has been churning out TMNT comic books since 2011. The series follows lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo as he embarks on a one-way revenge mission to take on the man responsible for the deaths of his three brothers in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City.
The series now also has a follow-up titled “Lost Years,” which details the preceding years in which Michelangelo embarks on a quest to become the Last Ronin while, in the present day, introducing four brand-new Ninja Turtles, Odyn, Yin, Moja, and Uno, who are under the tutelage of newly-appointed sensei, Casey Marie Jones.
At this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that “The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution” (2023) will arrive later this year.

Is “The Last Ronin” in a different universe?
“The Last Ronin” takes place in an alternate timeline now dubbed the “Ronin-verse.” However, it’s reasonable to consider that it follows on from the “present-day” IDW material, which is still ongoing.
The Ronin-verse is already expanding in the form of follow-ups such as “Lost Years,” the one-shot comic “Lost Day,” and the upcoming “Re-Evolution,” and also with many collectible action figures. There’s also a “Triple-A” video game in the works, although most fans would prefer a theatrical adaptation.

Will there be a “Last Ronin” movie?
Since it arrived in 2020, TMNT fans have been clamoring for a big-screen adaptation of “The Last Ronin.” In fact, fans have wanted a dark, gritty theatrical outing for well over three years. After all, this is the style and tone in which the Ninja Turtles first started in Mirage Comics, co-created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984.
Unfortunately, it looks like “The Last Ronin” won’t be getting the big screen treatment, or the small screen treatment for that matter — at least not anytime soon.
In an interview with ComicBook.com, Kevin Eastman discussed the fact fans have been hoping for a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” but explained that Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route instead.
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
While Nickelodeon could easily adopt DC’s “Elseworlds” strategy, which isolates films such as Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) from its shared universe installments, it looks like the universe established in Mutant Mayhem is their number one priority.
This may come as very disappointing news for fans of “The Last Ronin,” but there is a short, CG-animated, fan-made film on YouTube worth checking out. And then, of course, there’s the upcoming video game based on the ongoing comic book series.

When is “The Last Ronin” game out?
There’s currently no release date for “The Last Ronin” video game, though we do know it is inspired by the popular God of War video game series.
Earlier this year, Doug Rosen, Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said the game would focus only on Michelangelo. However, he added that Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, who only appear in the comics through hallucinations and flashbacks, may also appear in a playable format in flashback sequences.
Rosen also said that the mature themes of The Last Ronin (TBA) would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be.”

The “Mission Impossible” franchise has pulled off some of the biggest stunts in cinematic history. On many top ten lists of most dangerous stunts of all time is a scene from “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol” (2011) in which Tom Cruise's death-defying Ethan Hunt scales a skyscraper using suction gloves and makes a nerve-wracking jump, which leaves him hanging by one foot. The latest installment, “Mission: Impossible–Dead Reckoning Part One,” is no exception with audiences leaving the theaters mystified at how Cruise drove a motorcycle off a cliff. Stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood has been the stunt coordinator for the last three Mission: Impossible films. Eastwood has been in the industry for nearly 30 years and is credited with stunt work on some of the biggest recent blockbusters like “Interstellar,” “Inception” and “Troy.” Eastwood joins Larry on FilmWeek to discuss some of the biggest stunts he worked on for “Mission: Impossible–Dead Reckoning,” how he prepares actors to do death-defying feats, and whether or not the Oscars should add a stunt category to the awards.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtwY2Mub3JnL3BvZGNhc3QvZmlsbXdlZWsvbGFycnktbWFudGxlLWludGVydmlld3MtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXN0dW50LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yLXdhZGUtZWFzdHdvb2TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

His latest film, Oppenheimer, although Nolan’s first biopic, is no exception. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” (2005) by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, and tells the story of the scientist who invented the atomic bomb. The film is shot on IMAX® much like his previous works and maintains Nolan’s signature storytelling that plays with time and our perception of it.

Monster Hunter has had so many cool collabs, it’s hard to keep track, and it seems Street Fighter 6 is getting in on the Turtles action now, like a few other titles, as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are coming to the game from tomorrow, August 8th.
Now don’t get too excited, because you aren’t going to be able to battle Ryu or Rashid against Donatello (the best turtle) or Leonardo, this is more about custom gear for your online avatar. Players will be able to “style their custom avatars with new TMNT gear and emotes, apply fun new Titles, send TMNT stamps to the chat, customize their in-game mobile wallpaper and camera frames, and even turn their World Tour and Battle Hub custom avatar into their favourite Turtle! High Three”.
Elsewhere, A.K.I. was announced as the 20th playable Street Fighter 6 character, and Capcom put out some in-game cinematic footage from the World Tour mode as a surprise for the Evo 2023 crowd. A.K.I. will be coming in “Autumn 2023” and more will be shared about her at “a later date”.
The first DLC character revealed was Rashid, who was a lot of fun in the last game, but A.K.I. is a new character, and you can see the new trailer, below.
Capcom says that the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collaboration is the second branded partnership within Street Fighter 6 since its release in June 2023, following a collaboration with Onitsuka Tiger at launch”, and it’s a timely one with the Mutant Mayhem movie just out in cinemas. Even Session: Skate Sim got a TMNT update, and Xbox even make Pizza-smell-based controllers to celebrate the movie.

It might seem like a strange one, since Session: Skate Sim is a pretty hardcore Skateboarding sim, but it’s happening, and NACON says that “With your controller in one hand and a slice of pepperoni pizza in the other, you will need to show real skill to pull off the best tricks in a new spot specially created for the occasion”.
“Skateboarding fans can now ride out to conquer the New York sewer system in the guise of the famous heroes Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello”, the publisher adds, saying “A brand-new filter inspired by the movie’s artistic direction team has been adopted in the replay editor, and a whole collection of themed objects and content has been added in tribute to this iconic franchise”.
Check out the reveal trailer:
Session: Skate Sim invites players to dive into the genuine 1990s skateboarding way of life, when each stretch of pavement and each stairway was a great location for your favorite stunt. The game’s ultra-realistic physics bring the sensations of skateboarding to life, and the studio has even integrated ground-breaking gameplay, a first in a skateboarding game: the “True Stance Stick”, where each foot is independently managed using the two sticks. With a learning curve that is just as demanding as in real life, players have to practice how to control their board and pull off all the different stunts available in the game, from the simplest to the most complicated. The integrated editing tool lets each player immortalize their greatest achievements on video.
It’s worth noting that the developer also explained that “in order to continue to bring an ever more hard-core and complete skateboarding experience, the studio is working on new updates and additional content which will arrive in the coming months”.
Session: Skate Sim is out now for PC (Steam, Epic Games Store), PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZGlzYWdlZWsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvc2Vzc2lvbi1za2F0ZS1zaW0taXMtZ2V0dGluZy1hLXRtbnQtZnJlZS11cGRhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,TMNT Co-Creator Kevin Eastman Reveals Why The Last Ronin Became a Video Game (Exclusive),"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans wanted a movie, but a video game made more sense.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin introduced readers to a dark future where just one member of the team survived. The series was a massive success, and a video game based on The Last Ronin is currently in the works. While details are slim at this time, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman recently spoke with ComicBook.com's Jim Viscardi about the game. Eastman noted that a lot of fans had shared hopes of seeing a TV series or movie, but it was Nickelodeon that suggested going with a video game instead. Video of Eastman's comments can be found at the top of this page.
""Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn't wanna take The Last Ronin concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome). They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They've taken all the different drawings and moments... the stuff we've seen so far is goosebump city,"" said Eastman. ""It's really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.""
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a long history in video games, dating all the way back to 1989, when the heroes in a half-shell appeared in both an NES game, and a title release in arcades. In the decades since, gamers have been treated to countless games starring the TMNT, including recent options like Shredder's Revenge and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. It remains to be seen whether The Last Ronin video game will rank with the best, but it's a good sign that Eastman is so optimistic about it! Hopefully the game will prove enjoyable for fans of the comic, as well as those experiencing this world for the very first time.

2023-07-26 22:57:38+00:00,Ice Cube Claims in New Interview With Tucker Carlson He’s Lost $9 Million And Counting After He Refused To Get The COVID Vaccine,Ice Cube spoke to Tucker Carlson about why he decided not to get the COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic.,"Rapper and actor Ice Cube recently opened up to Tucker Carlson about his decision to not get vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic, a decision which he claims cost him a $9 million movie role … and more.
In a recent episode of the former Fox anchor’s show, Tucker on Twitter, Ice Cube said he refused to get the COVID-19 vaccination because he “didn’t feel safe,” calling it a “six-month kind of rush job.”
Carlson then asked if it was a tough decision to make, to which Ice Cube replied, “It wasn’t a tough call. I wanted to be an example for my kids and I wanted to make sure they didn’t take it either.”
“I want to stand on my convictions and that I was willing to lose $9 million and more, because we probably lost more since then,” he continued, referring to the role he was offered in Oh Hell No opposite Jack Black.
The rapper candidly addressed the reports circulating at the time, confirming that he “turned down” the movie because of the vaccine mandate.
“I turned down a movie because I didn’t want to get the motherfucking jab,” he said, per The Root. “I turned down $9 million. I didn’t want get the jab. Fuck that jab. Fuck ya’ll for trying to make me get it. I don’t know how Hollywood feels about me right now.”

But speaking to Carlson, Ice Cube maintained that he “never told anyone not to get vaccinated publicly.”
“I was pretty upset that that even came out because I was just going to quietly just not take it and deal with the consequences as they came,” he said.
The video included a clip of Kenan Thompson impersonating Ice Cube talking about his anti-vax views during an episode of Saturday Night Live.
He may have lost out on that $9 million role, but his career in film has only since continued. The rapper did some voice acting in the upcoming film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. He is also set to appear in War of the Worlds and The Killer’s Game. A third installment to his buddy comedy series with Kevin Hart, Ride Along, is also in development.
The interview between the unlikely pair was shared on Twitter in Carlson’s new web series, Tucker On Twitter.
The conservative talking head moved his platform to Twitter after he was suddenly fired from Fox in April.
His firing came just weeks after his text messages leaked, showing him privately bashing Donald Trump and his network’s coverage of the 2020 presidential election.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNi9pY2UtY3ViZS10dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi_SATtodHRwczovL2RlY2lkZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjYvaWNlLWN1YmUtdHVja2VyLWNhcmxzb24vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-09 21:00:27+00:00,Box office preview: ‘The Last Voyage of the Demeter’ and ‘Jules’ will battle against ‘Barbenheimer’,"There's very little doubt that ""Barbie"" can pull off a rare fourth weekend at #1 with upwards of $32 million or more.","There are two new wide or semi-wide releases this weekend, “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” and “Jules,” but how many moviegoers will actually buy tickets with so many other stronger contenders still in theaters? Read on for Gold Derby’s box office preview.
Before we get to the new movies this week, we probably should address the “Barbenheimer” in the room. There’s very little doubt that “Barbie” can pull off a rare fourth weekend at #1 with upwards of $32 million or more after holding up so well against “Meg 2” and the “Ninja Turtles” this past weekend. Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” also has a good chance at reclaiming second place, since it’s likely to have a smaller drop-off this weekend than both of last week’s new movies.
SEE Box office: ‘Barbie’ crosses $400 million mark in less than 3 weeks
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” was just two million behind “Meg 2: The Trench” over the weekend but received much better reviews and a higher CinemaScore, so we can probably expect it to hold up better and take third place, leaving fourth place for “Meg 2.”
That brings us to the first of the new wide releases, and that is Universal Pictures’ “The Last Voyage of the Demeter,” directed by André Øvredal (“Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). It’s based on the section of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” where the vampire travels by ship from Romania to England to continue his reign of terror. In this case, Dracula (or “Nosferatu,” going by the 1922 silent classic starring Max Schreck) is played by creature performer and actor Javier Botet.
The crew of the Demeter – that’s the name of the ship – includes Corey Hawkins from “Straight Outta Compton” as a British doctor hoping to get a trip back home, while the captain is played by veteran actor Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”) and his young son is played by Woody Norman (“C’mon C’mon”). Other known names and/or faces include David Dastmalchian (“Ant-Man,” “The Boogeyman”) as the ship’s first mate and Irish-Italian actress Aisling Franciosi (also “GoT”) as a stowaway.
While the movie definitely has the Dracula thing going for it and being dark horror by a fairly well-respected genre filmmaker like Øvredal, it’s also a period gothic horror film, which tend to be a tougher sell to American audiences. Case in point: 2012’s “The Woman in Black,” starring Daniel Radcliffe, opened shortly after the end of his “Harry Potter” run with $20.9 million in early February; its 2015 sequel sans Radcliffe earned roughly half the original film’s domestic take. The 2018 gothic horror film “Winchester” (also from the now defunct CBS Films) opened on the same weekend as “Woman in Black” with just $9.3 million and grossed less than $46 million worldwide.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
Earlier this year, the Dracula horror-comedy spin-off “Renfield,” starring Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage as Dracula, bombed quite badly, opening with just $8 million, so it’s odd for Universal to be releasing another Dracula spin-off (essentially) so soon.
There’s a good chance that a movie like “Demeter” can do well in European and other international countries, but Universal is only opening the movie in roughly 2,600 North American theaters, maybe realizing it would be a tougher sell. Reviews (which won’t hit until Thursday) probably won’t be so kind for various reasons I won’t break embargo to share, but those things alone might keep “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” from opening over $10 million. Because of that, it’s likely to open in fifth place behind last week’s rejiggered top four.
Filmmaker Marc Turtletaub, who received an Oscar nomination for producing “Little Miss Sunshine,” directs “Jules,” a smaller indie comedy starring Sir Ben Kingsley as a small-town Pennsylvania resident who encounters an alien after his craft crash lands in his garden. Bleecker Street Films will be releasing the movie moderately wide on Friday, also in an attempt to try to grab older adult business away from “Oppenheimer” mostly.
SEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million
Turtletaub previously directed the Sundance drama “Puzzle,” starring Kelly McDonald and late Bollywood great Irrfan Khan, but that movie didn’t even make $2.3 million worldwide, which is not a good sign that the producer of so many huge hits picks the best material to direct. (Turtletaub previously wrote “Gods Behaving Badly” and two short films, but he didn’t write either of his most recent features.)
Although Kingsley probably has a decent draw with older audiences, as does his co-star, Jane Curtin, a veteran from the early days of “Saturday Night Live,” there’s no theater count reported for “Jules,” as of this writing. Without having a presence in more than 1,000 theaters, there’s no guarantee this can even get into the Top 10, making something closer to the $2 million opening for the Bleecker Street release “Mafia Mamma” earlier this year, but probably less.
Also, Cohen Media Group will give a platform release to Juliet Binoche’s latest film “Between Two Worlds,” directed by Emmanuel Carrère. Check back on Sunday to see if the new movies fare better against the late summer blockbusters.

,"Ice Cube Talks 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Film, Shares Update on 'Friday' and 'Ride Along' Sequels",Ice Cube talks to ET about lending his voice to 'TMNT' and when fans can expected new installments in his film franchises.,"After a string of live-action movies, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back to being animated in the latest feature film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, with Ice Cube as one of the many A-list stars lending his voice to the cast.
While speaking to ET's Will Marfuggi about the upcoming theatrical release, the 54-year-old performer opens up about his friendship with co-writer, co-director and co-executive producer Seth Rogen and shares an update on the status of the long-awaited sequels in the Friday and Ride Along film franchises.
In the latest installment in the TNMT movie franchise, Cube voices the villain, Superfly, a mutant fly who wants all mutants to have dominance over humans. And for the performer, it was exactly the kind of character he likes to play.
""You want to do characters that make an impact,"" he says. ""So, to be Superfly, the supervillain with a heart, looking for love [and] looking for friends, the complexity of the role was just right up my alley.""
Encouraged to ad lib in the recording booth, Cube says he had fun adding more to the performance -- and adding a bit of comedy and authenticity to the role. ""He's the kingpin of New York,"" he says, noting ""you could do no wrong"" while bringing the character to life.
Lending his voice to the film also meant getting to work alongside Rogen, whom he considers a longtime friend. ""We've been cool for a while,"" the performer says, joking that there's ""a lot of weed in the air"" when they do get to hang out in person.
""But, it's fun. He's a creative guy that I've been wanting to work with this close for a while,"" Cube says, noting that his son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., ""got a chance to work with him in Long Shot,"" the 2019 rom-com also starring Charlize Theron.
Cube adds that when it comes to having Rogen helming the project alongside Brendan O'Brien, Evan Goldberg and Jeff Rowe, they had a ""fun dude"" at the reins. ""He knows pop culture and he's just smart, you know,"" he says. ""His style of comedy is unique and he finds the nuances that most people overlook.""
He adds, ""We've been trying to do a movie… And, you know, fortunately this is the first one. But we're going to do more.""
In addition to more films with Rogen, Cube has also been working on more sequels to the Friday and Ride Along film franchises. The latter, which was co-written by and starring Cube, first became a hit in 1995 before spawning Next Friday (2000) and Friday After Next (2002) with a third sequel, reportedly called Last Friday, long in the works.
""I'm in a situation [of] trying to get control of the movie where I can do it the way I want to do it when I want to do it,"" Cube says, adding, ""You know, that's been a task.""
As for Ride Along, the hit buddy cop action-comedy starring Cube and Kevin Hart first came out in 2014. It was followed up by Ride Along 2 in 2016, with the sequel also a big hit at the box office.
""We've been talking a little on Ride Along 3,"" Cube says, revealing that ""we haven't locked in on the right concept and the right place to take the franchise. We don't want to just do it just to do it.""
He adds, ""We need to do it and it needs to be, you know, a standalone movie that works. We're going to work it out. Kevin Hart, you know, he's hard to find too.""
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem debuts in theaters on Aug. 2.
This interview was conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike, which began on July 13, 2023.

2023-08-05 13:00:00+00:00,Seth Rogen on why he hasn’t joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe,Seth Rogen says he hasn't teamed up with Marvel is because his process would differ too much from the studio's.,"Seth Rogen has been a steady presence on the big and small screen for over two decades and is entering a hit franchise with the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, but he has yet to cross over into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something he says is intentional and comes out of fear.
Speaking with Polygon, Seth Rogen said he has shied away from working with Marvel due to his own process and the structure already in place. “We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love. It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with?”
Seth Rogen also suggested that a gig at Marvel might mean he couldn’t bring anything to the table that would allow for his personal touch. “[Comic books we come across] have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?” For this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, “[Co-writer Evan Goldberg and I] felt like there was an unexplored facet, and as people who have written a lot of teenage films and have been cinematically linked to that genre a lot over the years, we were like, Oh, like, that’s totally different for this, is if we do a teenage version of it…We are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!” Mutant Mayhem, which garnered strong reactions after its June premiere, arrives on August 2nd.
As far as comic book adaptations go, Seth Rogen has stayed far away from the likes of Marvel, instead championing the likes of Preacher (rival DC’s Vertigo), The Boys (WildStorm / Dynamite Entertainment) and Invincible (Image Comics), which returns this November. There was also The Green Hornet, which has comic ties, but the less said about that the better…

2023-08-06 17:51:37+00:00,"More, Please: Four Films Grossed Over $28 Million, a Summer Weekend Box-Office First","""Sound of Freedom"" and ""The Meg 2"" also grossed over $28 million this weekend, but ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning"" is running out of time.","This weekend represented a summer box-office first: Four films grossed over $28 million. The last time that happened was Thanksgiving 2018, a year when domestic ticket sales hit $11.89 billion. “Barbie” (Warner Bros.) led for the third time with $53 million, down 43 percent. It now stands at $459 million domestic and over $1 billion worldwide, something has happened that defies all normal distribution logic.
The reason four films rarely gross this much in a single weekend is studios do everything they can to prevent it. They make sure to stagger new openings and avoid any competitive roadblocks. Yet audiences defied that logic as “Oppenheimer” (Universal), off only 39 percent, added another $28.7 million in its third week for $228 million domestic, $553 million worldwide.
Then add two new releases with “Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros.) at $30 million domestic and $112 million worldwide, and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount), $28 million, with an additional $8.5 million in 24 initial markets.
Based on Sunday’s estimates, the order between #2-#4 could change. “Turtles,” with its Wednesday domestic opening, grossed $15 million before the weekend. Had it opened Friday, much of that gross would have ended up in the three-day weekend and it would easily have been #1. (Its five-day domestic haul is $43 million).
It’s a victory for theaters when multiple titles don’t cannibalize grosses. The $178 million weekend total wasn’t a record August weekend (the same weekend in 2016 did $228 million, over $270 million adjusted, with “Suicide Squad” providing over half the gross). However, the unusually strong number suggests that success feeds momentum.
“Meg 2: The Trench” Courtesy Warner Bros.
It’s also a bit reassuring to see two franchise films with decent starts. The animated “Turtles” cost $70 million pre-marketing and should gross $100 million domestic or more. The original “Meg” grossed $530 million worldwide; this one has already collected $130 million. “Turtles” had an A Cinemascore, “Meg” B-, so expect the former to have better domestic legs.
With 29 days of the movie summer season remaining and $3.4 billion in grosses, we’ve exceeded the same period in 2023 and $4 billion remains possible. Year to date is around $6 billion (depending on whether you include non-film theater events). Year to date that’s up 23 percent, which would project to $9.1 million for the full year.
At #5, “Haunted Mansion” (Disney) fell 63 percent to just under $9 million. “Talk to Me” (A24) at #8 had an outstanding drop of only 40 percent for a horror film, adding $6.2 million. “Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” (Moviegoers) from India is a close #9 with over $1.5 million in only 270 theaters, off only nine percent.
Though it remains a disappointment, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) at #7 fell only 39 percent. It crossed $500 million worldwide, but it’s running out of time; in 2018, “Fallout” reached nearly $800 million. “Sound of Freedom” (Angel), down 43 percent, placed #6 to $163 million reported so far.
“Passages“ Courtesy MUBI
Ira Sachs’ unrated “Passages” (MUBI) (after the MPAA slapped on a dubious NC-17) debuted with a promising $64,000 in three New York/Los Angeles locations ($21,333 average). It adds another 12 cities next Friday, though its expansion might be slightly limited if some theaters exclude unrated films.
Elsewhere, specialized titles struggle. “Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics) out of Sundance this year managed only $316,000 in 404 theaters. Even worse was “Dreaming Wild” (Roadside Attractions), $129,000 in 402. “CatVideoFest 2023” fared better with $115,000 in only 41 theaters.
“Theater Camp” (Searchlight) nearly doubled its theaters, but managed only $570,000 in 555. It has reached $2.4 million, with an ultimate $4 million. The reported acquisition cost out of Sundance was $8 million.

,TMNT Mutant Mayhem Found The Zombie Turtle Kid For The Best Viral Marketing Ever,"Remember the ""I like turtles"" kid? Well Paramount found him and implemented him into the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles marketing.","It’s been years since the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graced the big screen, but the superhero team is set to return next weekend with TMNT: Mutant Mayhem . As one of the next titles among 2023's new movie release dates prepares to hit theaters, Paramount has called upon a throwback meme to bring attention to its release, and the marketing idea is top tier.
Back in May 2007, 10-year-old Jonathan Ware went absolutely viral for appearing on a local news interview at the Rose Festival in Portland, Oregon. While in zombie makeup, a TV reporter turned the microphone to a kid attending the festivities to ask what he thought about the whole thing. He memorably responded with “I like turtles.” Over 16 years later, the marketing team behind the TMNT movie brought back the viral sensation for this bit:
Jonathan Ware is all grown up, in his mid-20s now, and yes, it is, in fact, the same Jonathan. He put the zombie makeup back on, and he got into character as his childhood self to say “I like turtles” to promote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. Obviously, the recreation of the now-classic internet meme is already going viral!
Commenters took to TikTok to react with things like “NO WAY!!!!!!!! He’s all grown up,” “living legend” and “This is something I never knew I needed.” Considering most memes like this live and die with a single video, it’s quite the welcome jump scare to see Jonathan Ware as an adult in the zombie makeup doing the meme years later. We have to wonder what his reaction was when he was approached by Paramount and how much the viral gentlemen got for helping promote the new TMNT movie. Since we’re getting nostalgic, check out the original video that started it all:
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Donatello and Leonardo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Release Date: August 2, 2023
Directed By: Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears
Written By: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg & Jeff Rowe
Starring: Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito, Maya Rudolph, Ice Cube, etc.
Rating: PG for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material
Runtime: 99 minutes
It’s pretty clever marketing on Paramount’s part ahead of the animated movie hitting theaters next weekend. Critics have also seen Mutant Mayhem and are loving it, with many saying the movie walks a nice line between being very nostalgic and a fresh take on the franchise. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise has been around since the early ‘80s, beginning as comic books before becoming a mainstay in toy sections and getting its own video games and beloved animated series. This latest movie sees Seth Rogen and his longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg putting their own spin on the franchise.
This year feels like it’s been an especially great year for studios stepping up their campaigns, especially on social media, between M3GAN ’s viral marketing efforts and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie inspiring people to wear pink outfits to theaters. You can look forward to the latest TMNT movie hitting theaters next Friday, August 2… if you like turtles, that is.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RtbnQtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1mb3VuZC16b21iaWUtMDAzODM4OTA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-13 20:21:05+00:00,Long Range Box Office Forecast: Early Prospects for GRAN TURISMO and THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER; Trends for BARBIE Climb to Potential $115M+ Debut,"This week's report takes a preliminary look at two releases from major studios slated to open August 11, Gran Turismo and The Last Voyage of the Demeter.","Photo Credit: Gordon Timpen/Columbia/Sony ; Rainer Bajo/Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment
This week’s report takes a preliminary look at two releases from major studios slated to open August 11: Gran Turismo and The Last Voyage of the Demeter.
Updated tracking for Barbie can also be found below, as the film continues to shatter expectations with pre-sales pacing higher than for any release since Black Panther: Wakanda Forever last November. Likewise, Oppenheimer is maintaining its relatively robust pace as the two films look to combine for a powerhouse weekend at the box office one week from now.
Gran Turismo
Sony Pictures
August 11, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $15M-$20M
Domestic Total Range: $35M-$55M
PROS:
The Gran Turismo video game franchise has endured over the last few decades, with its popularity helping to boost awareness and interest for this film adaptation.
Director Neill Blomkamp has had prior success with late summer releases in the form of District 9 and Elysium.
The movie’s fact-based approach to story—at its center is Jann Mardenborough, who went from playing the Gran Turismo game to embarking on a successful career as a professional race driver—might help this stand out from past video game adaptations.
CONS:
A significant amount of competition for male audiences will be in play late this summer, with Gran Turismo‘s opening weekend going up against the second frames of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Meg 2: The Trench.
Hollywood’s actors joining writers in their ongoing strike could impact the talent promotion phase of marketing.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter
Universal Pictures
August 11, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $5M-$10M
Domestic Total Range: $14M-$28M
PROS:
Horror has quite often over-delivered at the box office in recent months and years. This summer, however, has been light on horror releases, which could spur interest here if reviews and audience buzz are positive.
CONS:
The film has been delayed several times by this point, and early social metrics aren’t encouraging. With abundant competition for male audiences and the aforementioned possibility of the actors’ strike affecting promotion, it’ll be challenging for this to stand out based on current models.

2023-08-01 16:29:50+00:00,Book Review: 'The Ravening Deep' by Tim Pratt,"Luna Gauthier reviews The Ravening Deep, an Arkham Horror novel by Tim Pratt. Available from Aconyte Books August 4th.","Share this:
An ancient hunger has been awoken. It is never can never be satiated. It will just eat and eat until it devours the whole world. Unless a group of unlikely heroes can stop it. Abel Davenport, the man who awoke the eldritch god, Diana Stanley, a reformed cultist, and Ruby Standish, a thief of esoteric goods, don’t seem like the most likely monster slayers. But if the world is going to survive they’ll have to become more than that, they’ll have to become god killers. Check out Tim Pratt’s The Ravening Deep to see if they can stop Asterias before it consumes them all.
[Note: While I am reviewing this novel independently and honestly, it should be noted that it has been provided to me by Aconyte for the purpose of this review. Warning: My review of The Ravening Deep contains some spoilers!]
The sea holds many secrets
Abel was raised on tales of gods and monsters by his mother and he’s been a fisherman all his life. But he’s never seen much to convince him that those monsters are real. Until the day he almost died, that is. Caught at sea during a powerful storm, Abel is sure that his time is up. Then he wakes up on a rocky spot of land in the middle of the ocean. He finds a cave that contains some strange growths, an altar, and a medallion. When he touches the medallion he’s overcome with visions showing strange robed figures making sacrifices to an ancient god.
When the visions end, Abel is on a beach not far from his home. He still has the medallion but now he also has a purpose. The god from his visions saved him and he’s determined to resurrect the god to show his gratitude. He knows exactly what to do thanks to the visions from the medallion and he gets started right away.
Silver Twilight Lodge holds more
Diana owns a woman’s fashion store in Arkham. She’s been trying to join ever higher circles of society in order to grow her business. As part of her social climb, Diana joined the Silver Twilight Lodge. But after some sketchy situations, and one truly terrifying encounter Diana has realized that the Lodge isn’t just a social club. What’s more, she’s decided to take down the lodge from the inside. She’s just not sure how yet.
One night, Abel shows up drunk on her doorstep. She doesn’t know him but she decides to extend him a little kindness anyway. After bringing him in, giving him a place to sleep, and offering him breakfast, the two start talking. Abel shares his story of an ancient god from the deep that is planning on destroying the world. Awakened to the terror of Asterias and ashamed of his part in god’s return, Abel wants to stop the cult he’s started from realizing its goal. Diana shares her tale of a cult that controls Arkham and summons monsters. The two realize that by helping each other they may be able to end both threats.
Then Ruby gets thrown into the mix. She’s a talented thief who has stolen from the Silver Twilight Lodge in the past. The leader of the Lodge, Carl Sanford, took the theft as a personal insult and wants revenge on Ruby. He sets a trap to lure her back to Arkham and she’s almost caught. But Diana stumbles into the trap too and ends up freeing Ruby. After they talk the two realize that they can help each other, and Abel too. The three start working to stop Asterias and curb the Silver Twilight Lodge.
The Ravening Deep is a classic monster tale
Some of the Arkham horror stories keep the eldritch gods in the background. Even though they are mentioned and are usually the focal point of the story, they aren’t often actually seen. If they do make an appearance, it’s usually quick and couched in terms of “too much for the mind to comprehend” or “eyes couldn’t really focus on them” or similar ideas that cheap out on actually showing the monsters. There is a certain amount of terror from things that are seen from the corner of the eye or only in shadows or that are too much for the human mind to handle. But sometimes it’s nice to have a real, definable, physical threat to face.
Pratt has given us a nice corporal monster to fight in The Ravening Deep. Asterias has a real, physical body that our heroes are trying to keep from being resurrected. I really liked this change. The solidity of Asterias (and his maw) made him feel more real and more scary than a more ethereal foe. I really liked Pratt’s comets concept too. Not knowing who to trust or just how much strength the cult had was a nice twist as the story went along.
Another great Arkham Horror installment
The Arkham Horror series is a great collection. The various characters and dangers all centered around the city of Arkham are engaging and connected enough to feel like a real-world while varied enough to stay fresh. Pratt’s newest entry for the collection continues the tradition. There are familiar locations and names but the main characters and situation are new and exciting. The Ravening Deep manages to combine the unknown dangers of the ocean with an alien threat without feeling hokey.
Different story threads are hinted at for future novels without detracting from Abel, Diane, and Ruby’s current plight. The Ravening Deep is a total and complete story that still connects to the larger Arkham world, which is the whole appeal of this series in the first place. Each story is a self-contained adventure. Reading more stories from the collection will give you a deep connection and understanding of some situations but it isn’t actually necessary to enjoy any one book.
It’s the perfect type of series, in my opinion, engaging stand-alone stories that create a larger interconnected world. And Tim Pratt’s The Ravening Deep is the perfect continuation of this series. I highly recommend picking it up when it comes out on August 4th.
My Rating: 9/10

The Ravening Deep by Tim Pratt is available on August 4th. Will you be checking it out? Let us know on Twitter or in The Cosmic Circus Discord.

Barbie

Warner Bros.’ comedy declines only -36% to $21.5M, finally notching the runner-up slot after spending four frames in first place.

All time, Barbie has now earned the:






With $567.2M total through 31 days, it now ranks as the #15 biggest movie of all time, between April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie with $574.2M and 2019’s The Lion King with $543.6M.

Barbie also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only Mario. However, it’s running +12% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 31-day point in release: $503.7M.

Oppenheimer

Universal’s historical war drama declines only -43% to $10.6M, falling from second to third place.

All time, Oppenheimer has earned:

Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M




Fifth frame once again falling outside the top 100: $10.6M

With $285.2M total through 31 days, it now stands as the #117 biggest movie of all time domestically, ranking between 1990’s Home Alone with $285.7M and 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 with $281.7M.

It also stands as the #7 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 2018’s Deadpool 2 with $324.5M and 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded with $281.5M.

Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.

Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 31-day point in wide release:

-6% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $305.6M -13% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $328.2M -13% behind 2014’s American Sniper : also $328.2M -3% behind 2019’s Joker : $299.1M -6% behind 2017’s It : $305.2M

Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film. Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest original titles:

+14% above 2010’s Inception , through the equivalent point in release: $248.4M / only -2% behind its final total: $292.5M

+51% and counting above the final total for 2014’s Interstellar : $188.0M

+50% and counting above the final total for 2017’s Dunkirk : $190.0M

Last Wednesday, Oppenheimer also set another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never top a weekend box office.

It beat the prior record holder, 2016’s Sing with $270.3M, which peaked at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

Overseas / global

This weekend, Oppenheimer declined -38% overseas, milder than its -44% domestic drop.

Oppenheimer has earned $432.6M overseas and $717.8M globally.

That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M and Interstellar with $648M, and is right on the verge of surpassing Inception with $728M, likely later this week.

Globally, it’s now the #132 film of all time, ranking between 2021’s F9 with $726.2M and Nolan’s Interstellar with $715.7M.

Top overseas markets totals are:

U.K.: $63.8M Germany: $39.5M France: $31.2M Australia: $22.9M India: $18.4M Spain: $18.3M Mexico: $18.0M Netherlands: $16.1M South Korea: $12.6M Brazil: $12.5M

Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China and Italy.

IMAX

Oppenheimer has earned $80.8M domestically and $146.4M globally from IMAX, the #4 domestic and #5 global IMAX total of all time.

Globally, it only trails 2009’s Avatar, 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water, 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

In its third frame, Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot declines -45% to $8.4M, falling from third to fourth place.

After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $88.1M after 19 days. It’s already outgrossed two of the last three films in the franchise:

+7% and counting above the final total for 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $82.0M

+62% and counting above the final total for 2007’s TMNT : $54.1M

However, it’s running below both the franchise’s 2014 installment and another comparable title, through the equivalent 19-day point in release:

-40% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $148.4M

-23% below 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $114.3M

Overseas / global

This weekend, Mayhem declined -52% overseas in holdover markets, slightly steeper than its -45% domestic drop.

Mayhem has now earned $30.3M overseas and $118.4M globally.

It looks certain not to reach the $485M global total for 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but could still match the $245M global total for 2016’s Out of the Shadows.

Top overseas markets are:

U.K.: $9.0M Mexico: $5.0M France: $3.2M Germany: $2.0M

Last weekend, the film opened with less than $1M in China, only eighth place in that market.

Strays

Universal’s R-rated comedy about talking dogs didn’t have much bite, with only a $8.3M fifth place debut.

That’s lower than essentially every other August R-rated comedies of the past decade:

-13% below 2018’s The Happytime Murders : $9.5M

-31% below 2018’s The Spy Who Dumped Me : $12.1M

-43% below 2016’s War Dogs : $14.6M

-61% below 2019’s Good Boys : $21.4M

-75% below 2016’s Sausage Party : $34.2M

It also opened below some of this year’s other R-rated comedies:

-44% below June’s No Hard Feelings : $15.0M

Even with February’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance : $8.3M

However, it did open +43% above July’s Joy Ride: $5.8M

Audience demographics

Strays earned a “B+” CinemaScore, from an audience estimated at 56% male, 67% ages 25+, and only 46% white.

Overseas / global

Strays opened in a limited 21 overseas markets to $1.9M, for a $10.2M global opening.

While it’s not an exact comparison because of the wider rollout, Feelings opened to $9.5M overseas in 48 markets, for a $24.5M global opening.

2023-08-19 15:41:33+00:00,‘Painkiller’ Director/EP Pete Berg On How ‘Dog Day Afternoon’ Set His Career Path: Miramax Presents The Film That Lit My Fuse,Video interview with 'Painkiller' helmer and 'Patriots Day' director Peter Berg about his cinematic influences for Deadline's 'The Film That Lit My Fuse' series,"Miramax Presents The Film That Lit My Fuse is a Deadline video series that aims to provide an antidote to headlines about industry uncertainty by swinging the conversation back to the creative ambitions, formative influences and inspirations of some of today’s great screen artists.

Every installment asks the same five questions. This week’s subject is Pete Berg, director and executive producer of the Netflix limited series Painkiller. In six episodes, the series traces the rise of the opioid crisis from the vantage point of people who were prescribed Oxycontin for pain — Taylor Kitsch is particularly good — and then became hopelessly hooked on pills said to have the addictive power of heroin, to the wealthy Sackler family. That greedy clan is led by Richard Sackler (Matthew Broderick) who leaned in on grassroots marketing to get doctors to make Oxycontin their prescription drug of choice, and then allegedly hid behind their billions to shield the devastating effects the drug had on pain sufferers.

Berg got his break into the business as part of the cast of Chicago Hope, and he transitioned to directing and writing with the buzzy dark thriller Very Bad Things. His films include Patriots Day, Deepwater Horizon, Lone Survivor, Hancock, The Kingdom and Friday Night Lights. The latter he launched as a groundbreaking TV series which became a breakout venue for talent including Kitsch, Jesse Plemons and Michael B Jordan, among others. Here, he discusses how he found his mojo as a writer, director and producer.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tL3ZpZGVvL3BldGVyLWJlcmctaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXBhaW5raWxsZXItaW5mbHVlbmNlcy1kb2ctZGF5LWFmdGVybm9vbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Is 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning' A Failure?,Tom Cruise's latest entry in the Mission franchise hasn't taken the industry by storm as the franchise has come to expect. Does that make it a failure? Let's discuss.,"Powered by RedCircle

Tom Cruise’s ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1"" has not lived up to box office expectations the franchise has set, but the audience that has gone out to see it has responded very well. Given the lackluster performance, and the overall lack of conversation surrounding the film, would we consider the $290M budgeted film a failure? There are external factors to consider such as the competitive summer release calendar. Both Greta Gerwig’s ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan’s ""Oppenheimer"" followed up the latest ""Mission"" with a one-two punch we may never see again in the cultural phenomenon that was “Barbenheimer.” But the film itself could also be criticized for not drumming up hype all on its own.

Give our conversation on this central question a listen and head to the YouTube comments to let us know where you fall on the debate.

Stick around though, as this week’s episode also includes our review of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" an interview with Marvel’s ""Secret Invasion"" director Ali Selim, and more.

2023-08-01 15:00:00-04:00,"Interview: ‘Cruel Summer’ Showrunner Elle Triedman Talks the ‘Intense, Twisted, Fun’ Second Season","'Cruel Summer' showrunner, Elle Triedman, discusses the secrets, alternative endings and all that goes into the intense anthology series.","Another Cruel Summer has come to an end. No, not the record-breaking heatwaves that have been scorching the globe. I am referring to the addictive anthology series on Freeform that has kept viewers full of burning questions all season long. After the first season left viewers’ jaws on the floor, the challenge was on to deliver another intense season of mysteries and twists. Taking on the task of telling another dark and unpredictable drama was showrunner and executive producer, Elle Triedman.



Cruel Summer‘s second season finale just aired yesterday and Triedman spoke with Awards Radar all about it: her goals, keeping secrets from the cast and crew, the unexpected alternate endings, what happens to some characters after the series ends, and much more.



This season centers around an unexpected love triangle between Megan (Sadie Stanley), her best friend Luke (Griffin Gluck) and a new arrival in town, Isabella (Lexi Underwood) who quickly befriends Megan. All seems like high school business as usual until Luke turns up dead, suspiciously drowned in the lake.

CRUEL SUMMER – (Freeform) ELLE TRIEDMAN (EXECUTIVE PRODUCER)

(Warning: Luke’s death occurs in episode one – so it is not much of a spoiler. While we avoided some of the biggest reveals, the conversation is not spoiler-free – especially the end. If you are not caught u with the season two finale, proceed with caution.)

As an anthology series, each season is essentially a fresh start – new cast, new location, and a new mystery. This provided Triedman with a nearly blank canvas with which to work. “You do get to build it from the ground up, which is pretty incredible. I knew we were going to using Vancouver that was already established. So that setting it in the Pacific Northwest, and Washington State was perfect, because it looks like Vancouver, and it’s just spectacular.” The setting serves as a perfect backdrop for the dark subject matter the series likes to dabble with, she explained. “You get that sort of small town fell. It’s very woodsy but the water is also so dynamic. It’s sort of mysterious up there. It’s a little too quiet sometimes. Which is great for drama, and great for a murder. “



One reason this small town is ‘quiet’ is directly related to the time in which this story is set, the turn of the century before smartphones existed – right in the middle of the Y2K madness. While they may seem like more innocent times, especially since social media sites and apps did not exist in their current form, the characters are not immune to the power of gossip. “Years ago, you had the telephone game. We didn’t have social media, but word among friends spreads like rapid fire in a small town. People shift the story as they tell it, and it gets embellished,” explained Triedman.



“The impact of your one mistake in a small town is exponential. There isn’t another crisis of the day to kick you off that top headline. In the timeline of the winter of December 1999, this takes place over 12 or 13 days. So it’s very compressed, and everything is very heightened. If that were a three week period, some of the scandal would have died down. But everything just gets ratcheted up and up in this situation.”



While season one was intense, Triedman’s goal was to take season two up a notch or two, “I really wanted this season to feel different. I wanted more of an outright crime. I wanted a murder. I love puzzles. I love mysteries. I think it’s really fun to track that as a viewer. We definitely felt pressure to try to match the level of what we call ‘the doorknob moment’ at the end of season one. So that was a big goal.” (If you do not know what ‘the doorknob moment’ is, do yourself a favor after watching season two and check out season one as well – both are streaming on Hulu.)



While the addition of a murder is a great place to start, what really separates season two is an approach that more closely examines the bonds of friendship and family. “In season one, the girls, Kate (Olivia Holt) and Jeanette (Chiara Aurelia), were really on separate tracks – they barely interacted during the season. I really came in wanting to explore this very intense, non-romantic friendship between two late-teenage girls. That was something that was very, very important to me because I think it’s just such a unique and special time in people’s lives,” explained Triedman.

“It’s a relationship that had a lot of impact on my life and it’s really interesting to see; To have Isabella come in, like this meteorite, to this small town, to this girl, to this group of friends, and see her impact on it. You you sort of wonder, what if she hadn’t come? What would have happened with any of this.”



Many of the events of the season pivot around the decisions and actions of the characters. Though it may easy to judge their choices Triedman hopes viewers take a different perspective. “The thing that I always want to emphasize is, these are teenagers, these are 17 year-olds, and they’re works in progress. They’re trying to figure out who they are versus who they’ve been, and how their friends and their family and their community are seeing them versus who they want to be. You make a lot of mistakes along the way.”



“The fun of the show is, who you think the killer is, and trying to guess, episode to episode. It’s also been interesting to watch people’s loyalties shift from character to character, and someone they thought they hated. They may still hate them in the end, but maybe they see that there are more layers, and it’s not so black and white,”continued Triedman. “Especially with Luke, I think it’s interesting to see that by the time he gets to the last moments of his life, he realizes and sees all of his mistakes, and he wants to correct them. You’d like to think that if he had another few days, let alone, another 60 years, he’d probably turned out to be a different person.”

CRUEL SUMMER – (Freeform/Ricardo Hubbs) LEXI UNDERWOOD, GRIFFIN GLUCK

The death of Luke turns lives upside down, leaving his best friend a suspect and keeping viewers guessing where the actual truth lies right until the final seconds of the season. The puzzles may have kept viewers coming back for more, but equally important is the exploration of the character dynamics. “It was fun to play with such a great cast, the impact of a family, and what a crisis, a death, and some mystery does to a family – the lies and the secrets that are told. That was something that we certainly deepened over the season, said Triedman”



To accomplish this, the series requires layered characters for viewers to invest in, ones that have much more to them beneath the surface. Triedman broke down Isabella and Megan, who relationship is the heart of the series. “I think Isabella is a searcher. She’s someone who really craves family, and love, and a sense of community, and belonging. She’s on her path and will continue to look for that. I think she has major boundary issues, and a very twisted sense of loyalty and what that truly means.” She continued, “In terms of Megan, I think she’s someone who has always worked incredibly hard, who has also been aware that the playing field is not always even, that life is not fair. I think that she’s learned that sometimes some shortcuts are necessary. She is incredibly driven. And she is relentless, and will be, in terms of getting what she wants.”



(Warning: full on spoilers ahead)



Triedman held the biggest secrets, keeping the stars of the series in the dark for much of the time about the details of the mystery. “They were very patient, because I would not tell them much,” she explained. “In some ways, it doesn’t help you to know what’s coming. It’s hard to stay in the moment in terms of, especially who the killer is. If you know that in advance, it’s going to color your performance, it’s almost impossible for it not to.” She continued, “So I’m very good at keeping secrets. It was fun to have people on the crew guessing and trying to figure it out.”



Fans who watched either season know that on Cruel Summer it is not over until it is over; both seasons ended with final second jaw-dropping moments that changed the read on everything preceding them. The showrunner was able to keep that secret right until the very end. “When we did put out the final script, we did not put out the last two pages, except for people who absolutely needed.”



Scripts certainly would have read much different before the final killer was settled on. “We had a lot of different potential killers on the board,” said Triedman. “We had everyone from Debbie (Megan’s mom) to the Sheriff (Sean Blakemore). But once once we decided it was Isabella, that was a very clear line.”

CRUEL SUMMER – (Freeform/Justine Yeung) ELIJAH SILVA, SADIE STANLEY, SEAN BLAKEMORE

Throughout the season, Triedman enjoyed following the online chatter about the show during and after each episode’s airing. Every week had new details and revelations that had viewers not only shifting their theories, but also their allegiances. Some fans even expected the there was no victim, “There were so many theories that Luke was still alive. I never saw that coming,” recalled a surprised Triedman.



In the end, most our questions are answered but the fate of Isabella and Megan does remain open to some interpretation. Triedman believes Megan would stay true to her self. “She took that footage and gave it to the sheriff. You don’t just sit on something like that. Sadie’s performance is so great because you see her shock and anger and grief, and then her sort of steely resolve. So that may not be the only thing she would do, but I think she’s definitely going to make sure Brent doesn’t go down for this and get justice for Luke.”



As for Isabella, who was last seen flying solo to Ibiza under the name Lisa, could she pop up in season three, “It’s sort of too early to say what’s in store for the future? It is set up as an anthology series. I think it’s fun to keep them all separate, but we’ll see. It’s fun to have different interpretations. I think that’s a great way to leave it. Everyone can make their own decision about what happens next.”



When asked for three words to describe season three of Cruel Summer, Triedman responded with, “Intense. Twisted. Fun.” After that finale, they are three words all viewers should be able to agree on.

,Alternate Character Designs For April O'Neil in TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM — GeekTyrant,,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is pretty much a whole new reimagining of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, and with that came a very cool and wild art style and character designs.

For the most part, fans seem to enjoy this new version of the character and the new look that she’s sporting. The character was created by artist James A. Castillo, who took to Twitter to share some alternate designs of April. Those images came with the following note:

Barbie

Warner Bros.’ comedy declines only -36% to $33.7M, spending its fourth frame in first place, and marking the first film to spend four frames at #1 since The Super Mario Bros. in April.

All time, Barbie has now earned the:





With $526.3M total through 24 days, it now ranks as the #18 biggest movie of all time, between 2016’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story with $533.5M and 2019’s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker with $515.2M.

It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $574.1M.

However, Barbie is running +14% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 24-day point in release: $458.9M.

Overseas / global

This weekend, Barbie declined -47% overseas in holdover markets, steeper than its -36% domestic drop.

Last frame, Barbie surpassed the billion-dollar mark. It’s now earned $657.6M overseas and $1.18B globally.

Globally, that’s already the #25 film of all time, ranking between 2013’s Iron Man 3 with $1.21B and 2015’s Minions with $1.15B.

It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $1.45B.

Barbie’s top overseas markets totals are:

U.K.: $101.1M Mexico: $51.8M Australia: $47.3M Germany: $42.2M Brazil: $42.0M France: $34.4M China: $33.7M Italy: $31.0M Spain: $30.0M Holland: $15.4M

Oppenheimer

Universal’s historical war drama declines only -35% to $18.8M, rising from third to second place in its fourth frame, due to the steep fall of last weekend’s runner-up Meg 2: The Trench.

All time, Oppenheimer has improved by earning the:

Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M




With $264.2M total through 17 days, it now stands as the #129 biggest movie of all time domestically, ranking between 2017’s Despicable Me 3 with $264.6M and 2002’s Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets with $262.6M.

It also stands as the #9 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 2009’s The Hangover with $277.3M and 2011’s The Hangover Part II with $254.4M.

Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.

Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 24-day point in wide release:

-6% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $281.0M -15% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $311.4M -6% behind 2014’s American Sniper : $281.3M -5% behind 2019’s Joker : $277.9M -9% behind 2017’s It : $290.7M

Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film.

It’s already exceeded the final totals for both 2014’s Interstellar with $188.0M and 2017’s Dunkirk $190.0M, and potentially closing in on 2010’s Inception with $292.5M.

Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest films, through the equivalent 24-day point in wide release:

+16% above 2010’s Inception : $227.6M

+79% above 2014’s Interstellar : $147.0M / +40% ahead of its final total: $188.0M

+72% above 2017’s Dunkirk : $153.1M / +39% ahead of its final total: $190.0M

Oppenheimer is also closing in on another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never reach #1 at a weekend box office.

It already ranks #2 on that metric, behind only 2016’s Sing with $270.3M, which peaked at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

Overseas / global

This weekend, Oppenheimer declined -43% overseas, steeper than its -35% domestic drop.

Oppenheimer has earned $384.8M overseas and $649.0M globally.

That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M and Interstellar with $648M, though matching Inception with $728M will prove a bit harder.

Globally, it’s also the #163 film of all time, ranking between 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 with $653.4M and 2013’s Thor: The Dark World with $644.7M.

Top overseas markets totals are:

U.K.: $58.1M Germany: $35.4M France: $28.0M Australia: $20.9M India: $17.6M Mexico: $16.7M Spain: $16.2M Netherlands: $14.2M Brazil: $11.5M Saudi Arabia: $11.0M

Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China, South Korea, and Italy.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Last weekend, Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot came out of its shell with a $28.0M opening in fourth place.

This frame, it declines only -44% to $15.7M, accordingly rising one spot to third place.

That’s a milder drop than:

2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : -57%

2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (-59%)

2007’s TMNT : -62%

2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (-53%)

After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $72.7M after 12 days. Here’s how that compares to other comparable titles, through the equivalent 12-day point in release:

+13% above 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $64.1M

-1% below 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $73,543,868

-41% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $124.0M

+81% above 2007’s TMNT : $40.0M

Overseas / global

This weekend, Mayhem declined -48% overseas in holdover markets, slightly steeper than its -44% domestic drop.

Mayhem has now earned $21.9M overseas and $94.6M globally.

It looks almost certain not to reach the $485M global total for 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but may match the $245M global total for 2016’s Out of the Shadows.

Top overseas markets are:

U.K.: $7.2M Mexico: $2.9M France: $1.8M Germany: $1.7M

This weekend, the film opened with less than $1M in China, only eighth place in that market.

Later this month and next, the film will debut in key markets including Spain, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, and Japan.

Meg 2: The Trench

Last weekend, Warner Bros.’ shark-themed thriller failed to take as big a bite out of the box office, with a $30.0M opening in second place.

That was -34% below the debut of 2018’s original The Meg: $45.4M, opening in first place.

Now in its sophomore frame, Trench falls a steep -58% to $12.7M and fourth place. That’s steeper than the sophomore drop for The Meg: -53%.

Trench has earned $54.1M after 10 days. That’s -35% below The Meg through the equivalent 10-day point in release: $83.7M.

Overseas / global

This weekend, Trench declined -61% overseas in holdover markets, slightly steeper than its -58% domestic drop.

These kinds of films always earn the vast majority of their money from outside the U.S. and Trench is no exception, with $202.8M overseas and $256.9M globally.

The film has earned 79% from overseas, higerh than the original’s 73%.

Top overseas market totals are:

China: $90.2M [compared to the original’s $152.3M China total] Mexico: $15.0M U.K.: $9.7M France: $7.6M Spain: $7.4M Germany: $6.4M Italy: $4.2M Indonesia: $4.1M Malaysia: $3.8M Australia: $3.7M

Later this month, the film will open in key markets including South Korea and Japan.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter

Universal’s Dracula-themed horror thriller bit off a $6.5M opening in fifth place.

Compared to some other horror-thriller films from last August, 2022, that’s:

-43% below 2022’s Beast : $11.5M

-4% below 2022’s The Invitation : $6.8M

Compared to some other “thriller at sea” films, albeit non-horror releases, that’s:

-41% below 2015’s In the Heart of the Sea : $11.0M

-36% below 2016’s The Finest Hours : $10.2M

-44% below 2018’s Adrift : $11.6M

Audience demographics

The opening weekend audience for Demeter was an estimated:

62% male

75% ages 25+

44% white, 22% Hispanic, 16% black, and 11% Asian-American

Gave the film a “B-” CinemaScore

Outside the top five

Disney’s family horror comedy Haunted Mansion takes sixth place with $5.6M, in its third frame.

It’s earned $52.8M through 17 days. That’s +7% above 2003’s original Haunted Mansion through the equivalent point in release: $49.1M. (Although that’s also without adjusting for ticket price inflation.)

A24’s horror Talk to Me takes seventh place with $5.1M in its third frame, actually rising one spot after coming in eighth last weekend. Its -19% decline represents the mildest drop among the top 10.

Angel Studios’ faith-based action drama Sound of Freedom takes eighth place with $4.8M, in its sixth frame.

With $172.8M after 41 days, Sound is certainly the biggest box office surprise of 2023 so far. It’s earned more than such expected summer blockbusters as the new Fast and the Furious, Indiana Jones, Fast and the Furious, and Mission: Impossible installments, plus The Flash and Pixar’s Elemental.

Paramount’s action-adventure sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One takes ninth place with $4.6M, in its fifth frame.

It’s earned $159.5M through 33 days. That trails both its two Mission: Impossible predecessors through the equivalent point in release: -18% below 2018’s Fallout with $195.8M and -7% below 2015’s Rogue Nation with $171.8M.

Weekend comparisons

Total box office this weekend came in around $110.5M.

Here’s how this weekend compares to last weekend, the same weekend last year, and the same weekend in the last pre-pandemic year of 2019:

,"The World and Everything in It: August 4, 2023","On Culture Friday, explaining the absurd reasoning behind a headline that abortion bans create teen parents; Reviews of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:…","The World and Everything in It is made possible by listeners like us. Hi, I'm Trey and me and my wife Lydia often listen to the world together early in the morning. Today just so happens to be her birthday. And so I want to wish her a happy birthday on her favorite podcast. I love you hun and I hope you enjoy today's program.



MYRNA BROWN, HOST: Good morning!

A potentially challenging season for pro lifers in Wisconsin, the abortion ban in Texas and a First Amendment victory in Illinois!

PAUL BUTLER, HOST: That’s all ahead on Culture Friday with John Stonestreet.

Plus, two movies about teenagers with superpowers.

SUPERFLY: Let me guess. Fifteen years ago, right? Some sludge was pumped in the sewer, and y’all came from that.

RAPHAEL: We prefer the term “ooze,” but yeah.

BUTLER: Also, Ask the Editor for August.

And Whitney Williams on spiritual lessons learned during embryo adoption.

BROWN: It’s Friday, August 4th. This is The World and Everything in It from listener-supported WORLD Radio. I’m Myrna Brown.



BUTLER: And I’m Paul Butler. Good morning!

BROWN: Up next, Kent Covington with today’s news.

Trump latest » Donald Trump told a magistrate judge on Thursday that he is not guilty … of trying to overturn the 2020 election.

And former president told reporters outside a Washington D.C. courthouse:

TRUMP: This is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America.

His plea came two days after Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith announced the latest indictment against Trump.

It charges him with four felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.



He’s scheduled to appear in the same court later this month … when a judge will set a tentative trial date.



Hunter latest » Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn reacted Thursday:

BLACKBURN: Attorney General Garland can no longer say there is one standard of Justice. There are clearly two standards of justice.

She said the Justice Department has gone after Trump while protecting President Biden.

Her remarks came after Republicans released a transcript Thursday of their closed-door interview with Hunter Biden’s friend and former business partner, Devon Archer … who served with Hunter on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

He testified that people would be intimidated to mess with Burisma with the Biden name attached to the company … and that the Biden “brand” was critical to Burisma’s survival.

Archer testified that to his knowledge, Joe Biden was never directly involved in Burisma business dealings. But his testimony does seem to refute the president’s prior claims that he was entirely disconnected from his son’s business activities



Blinken Security Council » Secretary of State Tony Blinken addressed leaders on the UN Security Council Thursday … and challenged them to send a clear message to Moscow:

BLINKEN: Enough. Enough using the Black Sea as blackmail.

Russia recently pulled out of a grain deal that allowed Ukraine to safely export grain around the world. Many impoverished nations have relied on those shipments to stave off hunger.

Blinken said the Kremlin is using the world’s most vulnerable people as leverage in its “unconscionable war.”



And after the meeting, the secretary added:

BLINKEN: We are the largest contributor by far to the World Food Program, 50% of its budget every single year. And today, I was able to announce another $360 million dollars in assistance.

Blinken also seemed to take an implicit jab at China for not contributing more.



IRS paperless » Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says by 2025 … the IRS will offer an entirely paperless experience.

She announced the initiative yesterday, saying the change will save about $40 million a year in document storage costs.

Yellen: It will enable taxpayers to see their documents securely access their data and save time and money. And it will allow reports of the IRS to rely on these digital copies to provide faster refunds…and deliver a more seamless and responsive customer service experience.

The shift will also cut office paper correspondence in half and digitize all tax records.

But Yellen said citizens will always have the option of submitting their taxes on paper.

Two sailors » Two U-S sailors have been arrested on espionage charges… after they allegedly provided sensitive military information to China.

U-S attorney Martin Estrada:

ESTRADA - The scheme alleged here is just one more example of the People's Republic of China's ongoing and brazen campaign to target US officials with access to sensitive military secrets.

The suspects allegedly provided China information on military exercises, operations, and technical material … in exchange for cash bribes.



Kherson church shelled » Russian shelling has damaged an 18th-century church in the Ukrainian city of Kherson.

MOS (Ukrainian): [In and under]

One witness said smoke began rising from the historic church in the early morning hours.

Until last year the church held the remains of Prince Grigory Potemkin … an 18th-century Russian military commander who advised Catherine the Great to expand the Russian empire into what is now southern Ukraine.

A Russian missile destroyed a historic cathedral in the city of Odesa last month.

Russian attacks have damaged or destroyed dozens of cultural monuments across the country since the start of the war.

I'm Kent Covington.

Straight ahead: Culture Friday with John Stonestreet.

Plus, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the big screen.

This is The World and Everything in It.

BUTLER: It’s the 4th day of August 2023.

Glad to have you along for today’s edition of The World and Everything in It. Good morning, I’m Paul Butler.

BROWN: And I’m Myrna Brown. It’s Culture Friday.

Joining us now is John Stonestreet, the president of the Colson Center and host of the Breakpoint Podcast. John, good morning.

JOHN STONESTREET, GUEST: John, for the first time in 15 years, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has a liberal majority. That’s worth noting because the court is expected to consider a challenge to the state’s pro-life law.

This week the court swore in Judge Janet Protasiewicz for a ten year term.

In her remarks she used the word impartial…impartiality twice. I mention that because the office she holds is technically non-partisan, yet her campaign was financed by Democrats, pro-abortion groups and other liberal figures. That doesn’t have an impartial ring to it. What do you think?

STONESTREET: Well, it doesn't. But I think it's important that we wait and see how exactly this particular judge rules. I mean, that's the only way to really figure out if someone is actually committed to the law or committed to a particular take on the law. You know, I think this is one of the things that we can continue to hear, for example, about the Supreme Court being so quote, unquote, partisan, even though if you actually do the numbers, the United States Supreme Court, actually it was just kind of in the same trend line is courts before it in terms of how many things that how many cases they ruled on unanimously, how many cases were wrote on it with an eight to one majority in other words that weren't divided down party lines. And yet, all we've heard is that the Supreme Court is illegitimate, illegitimate, illegitimate, because they're so political, and they're so partisan, and they're so partial, even though the facts don't point to that. And one of the reasons I think you see the court kind of in line here is because of what a conservative judicial philosophy is that you know, that there's actually a law and that law is something that we are to interpret, we are under that law, we do not make the law, it's not the the judges job is not to, you know, push a nation closer and closer towards some sort of kind of utopian future of the, you know, perfect justice or something like like that. In contrast, a progressive vision of the law was really, I think, basically articulated most clearly, recently, or at least in recent decades by Sonya Sotomayor, in a speech that she gave before she became a Supreme Court justice, the one that came up during her confirmation hearings, and what she said, “To judge is an exercise of power.” Look, there's a world of difference between thinking that judging is an exercise of interpretation and to judge is an exercise of power. There's a world of difference between assuming that the future of a society heading towards justice depends on you, and that you are a lawmaker in the role of judge versus one that says you are to not evaluate what a particular law is, that's, you know, another branch of government's job, but yours is to actually interpret what was done in light of that law. And that's what's so fascinating and all these claims of impartiality. So what I want to do is give this particular justice, you know, the benefit of the doubt and say, How are you actually going to rule. But the idea that somehow we are impartial in our perspective, that's just not true. We come with a lens, we come with a worldview, a vision of reality, and that will tend to play itself out and the decisions we make and for judges that those are decisions that affect everybody else.

BROWN: As we talk about what could be a challenging season for pro-lifers in Wisconsin, I want to turn your attention to another pro-life story that’s being shared and posted on a number of different platforms, yours included. It’s the story of two teenagers, their unwanted pregnancy, the abortion ban in Texas and their twin daughters, now two years old. The headline says, “An abortion ban made them teen parents.”

Is it really that simple?

STONESTREET: I just, you just see these headlines and you think, wow, I don't even know what to say. This is pretty basic biology. What makes people teen parents is when teenagers have sex and unprotected and they end up getting pregnant. This is not bigotry. It's biology. It's not rocket science, either. Laws don't make people pregnant. They just don't. I mean, I'm tempted to just kind of leave it at this complete level of snark. But what was so challenging here is that essentially, the Washington Post who printed this article, follow this young couple who basically are married because of risky sexual behavior. Even in the article, by the way, as I read it, they were like, well, they met at a state skate park and hung out. And three weeks later, she turned up pregnant as if there's not another, you know, detail there that, you know, is actually applicable and maybe matters, it was bizarre, honestly. But it goes on to basically suggest that had abortion been legal, that would have been a better decision. So imagine these two little girls. Now to the young man, the only thing by the way, according to the article that is making this young man resemble an adult in any sort of real way in terms of getting a job and doing something other than just sit around and play video games all day, and by the way, that's the the article itself is the fact that he's a dad, this is actually making him a better person. But the immaturity is so thorough between both of them, and the bad decision that they made, and suddenly, basically the the article just kind of implies that they should have had an abortion. So imagine these two little girls, you know, growing up and reading this article one day, I mean, it's just it's just horrific. It's just awful, awful stuff right now that we have now entered a time I mean, it's just so far beyond the safe, legal, and rare rhetoric of the 90s to abortion is a is a good and when it's restricted, it's a bad, and that includes for the child who would have been killed anyway. It was it was just a stunning article. And it just got horrific once you got past the headline, which was just a patently ridiculous thing to say. I mean, let me just repeat it for everyone, you know, keeping score at home an abortion ban made them teen parents.

BUTLER: John, I’d like to step in here and get your take on a very different story…a First Amendment victory in my home state of Illinois. Maggie DeJong (Dee-Young) was an arts therapy student at Southern Illinois University.

She sued the college last year when three students complained that DeJong’s religious and political viewpoints, often posted on her social media account, constituted harassment and discrimination. And the school went along with it.

With the help of Alliance Defending Freedom, she sued the college and walked away with an $80,000 settlement.

What do you think will be the effect of this decision on First Amendment rights for other Christian college students?

STONESTREET: Look, the religious freedom rights of students have been so thoroughly protected by the courts, including the Supreme Court, that anyone who feels like they've been unfairly discriminated against should immediately come forward. And it will be good for everyone. Look, you will probably will probably win if the track record says anything and and the fact of the matter is they're still bureaucrats who run these various departments at these institutions, including public institutions, that just for some reason, haven't gotten the memo. You know, the way you told the story, Paul, was it was a little bit truncated. In other words, it wasn't just these three students complained, but then the university turned around and systemically harassed her. They actually put out a restraining order so that if Maggie walked into a coffee shop, and these other students were there, she had to leave and that was even off campus. They held a community meeting, and she was the topic of how to actually and I mean, they basically, based on these complaints held her up as someone who was doing grave harm to these other students, they that I actually just recently sat down with Maggie at an event and and heard this story firsthand. And I, my you know, look, it's my job to pay attention to these things. And my job was on the floor, that these folks at Southern Illinois University believed that they could get away with this, and just patently mistreat a student, because that she had viewpoints. And it wasn't like, you know, she was going around, threatening anyone or challenging anyone’s safety or anything like that. And what made this even harder was her vision for using this arts therapy degree to help others was so, so so clear, and was so promising. And thank the Lord, she's actually landed, I think, in a wonderful situation, and her courage now has paid off. And I don't just mean financially with an $80,000 settlement. But I mean, it has clarified her vision and it's clarified her calling. And I guess I just continued to look around and see, you know, three high school girls that stood up on the athletic question out of Connecticut and, and a young master student, graduate level student here, standing up and I just compare that to so many Christians who are just who just don't want to not even stand but stand with those who stand and right now the people that are showing us what courage is, or the Maggie DeJongs of the world, and I'm grateful for them and good for her. It's an amazing story. And you need to go to ADF's website and just read the details of what these folks at Southern Illinois University tried to do to me, you just will be shocked. And you will just be amazed that she could get up and go back. I mean, imagine just going everyday to school where everyone hates you and talks about you out loud in front of I mean, it was just it was like the college administrator version of Mean Girls, it was just insane what they did to her and good for her for standing up. And again, thanks to ADF for being there for her.

BUTLER: John Stonestreet is president of the Colson Center and host of the Breakpoint podcast … thanks, John!

STONESTREET: Thank you both.



BROWN: Today is Friday, August 4th.

Thank you for turning to WORLD Radio to help start your day.

Good morning. I’m Myrna Brown.

BUTLER: And I’m Paul Butler.

Today we take a look at two new animated movies about teenage superheroes, one in theaters and one on streaming. Here’s arts and culture editor Collin Garbarino.

COLLIN GARBARINO: In 1983, comics creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird wondered what it would look like for the slowest animal to take on a job that required quickness. This absurd thought experiment gave birth to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Almost overnight, those heroes in a halfshell became cultural icons.

This week, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, rebooting the 40-year-old franchise and continuing its legacy of reveling in the absurd.

LEONARDO: Master Splinter has given us a very important mission for tonight. The target is across the street. We must use stealth and cunning to infiltrate the human world and retrieve … Go-Gurt.

ALL: Gooo-guuurrrttt.

MICHELANGELO: Okay, Batman.

The four mutant turtles, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael live in the sewer with an old rat named Splinter who acts as their adoptive father. Splinter taught his turtle sons martial arts using scavenged videotapes because he fears the world above.



LEONARDO: Don’t let any humans see you, because why?

ALL: Humans are the demon scum of the earth, avoid them, don’t say “hi,” they lust to murder that which is different from them to interact with them is to die.

LEONARDO: Hey, I know that’s objectively prejudiced but that’s what Dad taught us.

But Leo, Mickey, Donnie, and Raph aren’t so sure that all humans are evil. Life outside the sewer looks kind of fun.



MICHELANGELO: I think humans seem kind of cool to be honest. Beyonce.

RAPHAEL: Drake! That guy’s the goat of all humans.

LEONARDO: I’d love to have a champagne brunch with Tom Brady.

MICHELANGELO: Guy Fieri seems like a fun hang, and I’ve always wanted to go to Flavortown.

The brothers think that if they can prove they’re heroes, humans will accept them, so they set off to defeat a villain who goes by the name Superfly. They’re shocked to discover Superfly is actually a giant mutated fly. They thought they were the only mutants.



SUPERFLY: Let me guess. Fifteen years ago, right? Some sludge was pumped in the sewer, and y’all came from that.

RAPHAEL: We prefer the term “ooze,” but yeah.

LEONARDO: It’s like more… It’s just nicer.

RAPHAEL: It rolls off the tongue better, yeah.

ALL: Ooze.

LEONARDO: It’s nice, right?

Mutant Mayhem is family friendly, but the script by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg pushes the boundaries of good tastes. The movie’s rated PG for some martial arts action, mild language, and gross-out humor.

The voice acting is delightful. The movie has real teenagers play the turtles. Jackie Chan and Ice Cube are fun as Master Splinter and Superfly. But the best part of the movie is the animation. It’s fresh and kinetic, with an off-kilter style that’s reminiscent of quick notebook sketches and sidewalk chalk. Visually it pays homage to the grittiness of Eastman and Laird’s earliest comics, while embracing the sillier aspects of the turtles’ legacy.

The Ninja Turtles are animals who take on aspects of humanity through radioactive ooze. Our other feature is about human teenagers who get the superpowers of animals from magical gemstones.

Miraculous: Ladybug and Cat Noir, the Movie recently debuted on Netflix. This feature film is based on the popular French TV series with the similar name Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir. The movie isn’t a continuation or a reboot. It’s sort of like an abridgment of the five-season series.



ADRIEN: Your dad has a bakery? That’s so cool!

MARINETTE: Yeah, waking up to the smell of fresh croissants every morning.

ADRIEN: Your dad sounds awesome.

Marinette and Adrien are two Parisian teenagers who each find a miraculous gemstone that has a magical animal living inside. These tiny creatures grant superpowers to the teens.



TIKKI: I’m a tiny genie, except I don’t grant wishes, but together we’ll do the most dangerous stunts, risk our lives, and save the world!

Marinette gets the powers of the lucky ladybug, and Adrien gains the destructive potential of a black cat. But neither knows the other’s secret identity.



LADYBUG: Who even are you?

CAT NOIR: Name’s Cat Noir.

LADYBUG: Do I know you?

CAT NOIR: I’m the new hero in town. Here, to save the world.

LADYBUG: Ha! With what? Furballs?

The two heroes battle monsters spawned by human grief and anger. The movie has plenty of action, but just like the series, the real attraction comes from the teenage romance. Marinette is in love with Adrien. But Adrien isn’t interested because he’s in love with Ladybug. It’s sort of like Clark who loves Lois who loves Superman, except this time both characters have secret identities.

Miraculous: The Movie juices up the story with improved animation and some Disney-style musical numbers.



[Marinette singing]

The Ninja Turtles movie surpasses the franchise’s other adaptations, but this Miraculous movie feels rushed. The TV series has got a lot of heart that this hour-and-45-minute feature fails to capture. It looks like the race for the best animal-human superheroes will be won by the tortoise—err—turtles.

I’m Collin Garbarino.



BROWN: Next up on The World and Everything in It: Ask the Editor…Paul, what do you have for us?



PAUL BUTLER, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Well Myrna, two comments today: one about street-level journalism and the other regarding the faith of our sources. Our first email today comes from 5th grade school teacher Kathryn Lewis. This is what she writes:

WORLD’s recent cover story on American exceptionalism strays from the organization’s ethos of street level journalism. I subscribe to WORLD because it uniquely reports on actual current events happening here and all around the world, not because I’m looking for a history lesson. WORLD does better when it reports on real events happening in real time.

We’ve had a few similar observations over the last year since our recent magazine redesign. Some readers wonder if we are straying from our mission of street level, Biblically directed reporting. For this one, I thought I’d invite Lynn Vincent to respond. She’s the executive producer of WORLD Magazine and we serve together on the Editorial Council.

LYNN VINCENT: Thanks Paul. First, a little history: I worked full-time for WORLD Magazine from 1998 to 2009 before rejoining WORLD in 2022 as the magazine's executive editor. I have received every issue since 1998. From 2009 to 2022 I was primarily a subscriber. The problem is, I live in California. Besides other … well … problems associated with living in California, one is the incredibly slow mail—especially post-pandemic. You may have noticed that in your area as well.

In today’s fast-moving, instant-everything news environment, this presents a challenge for a magazine that arrives in your mailbox every two weeks. So when I became editor, I asked myself, how can we provide our subscribers with a rich, value-added reading experience that feels fresh even if it takes a little time for them to receive their copy?

What we decided to do was embrace the fact that while WORLD radio and digital are more suited to breaking and daily news, WORLD magazine is uniquely suited to bring you in-depth reporting and analysis, profiles, and longer-form journalism from a Biblical worldview.

In fact, I believe that WORLD Magazine now provides our members with deeply reported — as well as under- or unreported stories—that are unavailable anywhere else. We are doubling down on street-level, Biblically directed reporting in four ways:

- We've refreshed our approach to the opening story in our Dispatches department. That story is now the last item reported and written before the magazine goes to press. This is to ensure we bring fresh reportage from a Christian worldview to a story that’s in the news.

- We've added four pages of U.S. and global news briefs. These briefs focus on delivering underreported or unreported news in America and around the world.

- And we've returned to reporting news in our Notebook section at the back of each issue…covering “beats” like sports, technology, science, religion, and education.

- Our 18-page features section focuses on in-depth reporting, presented with beautiful photography and informative graphics. We’re also excited to include occasional cover essays by Christian thinkers who are experts in their fields. Like columnist Cal Thomas on the fall of journalism. Molecular biochemist Michael Behe on how advances in the field of microscopy are also advancing the Biblical view of origins. And Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon on the left’s attack on the art of satire.

PB: For our second question today…one that came in a few days ago from listener Victor Chen. He writes:

I often wonder how many guests on the WORLD podcast are non-believers? And are any people hostile that the podcast is Christian and refuse to be on the program?

Well Victor, I don’t have an exact number for you…but here are three things about our process. First, for any news story that has clear Biblical teaching—or a crucial Christian worldview connection—we primarily look for Christian sources to address and analyze those issues. In addition to expertise in their field, we try to find believers with a shared conviction regarding the foundational nature of God’s revelation in the scriptures. That doesn’t mean we agree theologically on every point, but we believe that they have Spirit-led insights that can help fellow Christians understand and interpret the news better than non-believing sources.

Second, there are a lot of news stories that are purely informational. Stories without obvious Biblical worldview ramifications. For these stories we feel comfortable casting a broader net. We may find an expert who can help us understand economics, government policy, or technology who doesn’t share our faith—though we often look for believers first…but we don’t restrict it.

Third, there are some occasions where we actively seek out guests who we fundamentally disagree with. Either to better understand their position…or because there is some shared ground on an issue…like our recent interview with Erin Friday on protecting kids from transgender ideology.

Finally, to your last question...there are times when we approach possible sources or experts who decline to participate when they discover our Christian commitments. But it’s amazing to me how many non-believers are actually intrigued by our approach. While some get nasty, I’ve also had experts graciously decline an interview and then go on to suggest a Christian colleague or source they know.

The Apostle Paul writes in Romans 12:18: “If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.” Let’s face it, many people have had bad experiences with reporters. And bad experiences with Christians. So it’s not surprising that it’s sometimes hard to get non-believers to trust us. But I believe our commitment to the truth, plus our track record for respecting people who disagree with us, often earns us access to those who may not usually be open to talking to a Christian news organization.

And that’s this month’s Ask the Editor. I’m Paul Butler.







PAUL BUTLER, HOST: Today is August 4th. This is The World and Everything in It from listener-supported WORLD Radio. I’m Paul Butler.

MYRNA BROWN: And I’m Myrna Brown.

When a woman goes through in-vitro fertilization trying to become pregnant, she often has embryos left over. Worst-case scenario, they may be frozen indefinitely or eventually discarded. And that makes IVF a problematic process–something WORLD has reported on before.

BUTLER: Still, sometimes embryos are adopted by another loving family…and when that happens, many lives can be changed for good. Commentator Whitney Williams has seen that firsthand.

WHITNEY WILLIAMS, COMMENTATOR: Nine years ago, a woman called me from Portales, New Mexico to question whether or not I was fit to be a mother. And more specifically, was I fit to be the mother of her biological children?



She and her husband had struggled with infertility. They sought help from IVF, birthed three children from it and now had more embryos frozen than they felt they could parent. My husband and I, on the other hand, desired more children. But we found out via our firstborn that we both carried a harsh genetic disorder. It seemed like a match made in heaven–these little lives needed a mother to carry them, and a home and a family to nurture and love them, and I longed to be pregnant and give birth again, because to be honest, my first go around was a disaster.



I got, what, maybe ten minutes with my newborn baby before he was whisked away for transport to a nearby children’s hospital, my husband by his side? Sorrow and fear loomed over any bit of joy I could eeek out. I wanted a do-over, and this phone call was my chance! But was I good enough to meet this couple’s standards? And how does one prove that to a stranger?



As I gripped my phone, I paced up and down our cracked, uneven driveway, breath quick, heart racing. I had a choice to make–Do I make my husband and myself sound amazing to this lady or do I tell the truth?



I chose the latter. It’s God who’s amazing, not us, I told this woman in other words. So amazing was His grace, I explained, that He chose to scoop us up into His loving arms when we were dead and stinking in the bottom of a pit of our own transgressions. And honestly, we still close our eyes to our good God and stumble into that pit sometimes, but He keeps scoopin’.



It’s been ten years, but I remember her saying something along the lines of, “OK. I’ll talk to my husband and get back to you.” The girl was inscrutable.



But…God made a way. And after several miscarriages of those embryos, my husband and I got to experience the miracle of birth once again, this time with heaps of unmarred joy and gratefulness. Today, our twins are six years old, and their biological mom–the one I met on the phone that day–is so much more than that. She’s my friend, my sister in Christ, and she and her family consistently shower God’s love upon us.



I’ll never be able to thank her and her husband enough for choosing life for their remaining frozen embryos and for choosing us to be their parents. The fact that they deemed us worthy when we were far from it makes us want to be the best parents we possibly can be, not because we feel like we need to continue to earn their approval, but more because we see what a gift we’ve been given.



And being chosen like that, well, it changes you.



I’m Whitney Williams.

,The Boys Is About To Get Even More Shocking Than That Explosive Season 3 Scene: ‘Gen V Has Some Really Crazy Shit In It’,"Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg promise The Boys Season 4, Gen V, and Invincible Season 2 will be full of jaw-dropping moments. Read more at Empire.","Few people in Hollywood have the ability to shock like Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. From Superbad onwards, the writer/director/producers have been proliferating Hollywood with wild images and gags to make you choke on your popcorn – and they’ve showed no signs of slowing down. Just look at last year’s Season 3 of The Boys, their Prime Video series adaptation of Garth Ennis’ comics, spinning a no-holds-barred superhero satire where great power leads to head-spinning irresponsibility. Not only did that season bring the comics’ infamous, orgiastic ‘Herogasm’ event to the screen, but it contained something even more jaw-dropping: an elaborate sex-act-gone-wrong that’s almost impossible to describe – with the Ant-Man-esque Termite learning the horrifying consequences of re-embiggening while, erm, running around inside a sensitive piece of someone else’s anatomy.

The result was astoundingly gory – and there’s plenty more where that came from. Speaking to Empire, Rogen and Goldberg promised considerable carnage to come, not just in The Boys Season 4, but in spin-off series Gen V, and the second run of their equally-explosive animated show Invincible. There are scenes just as shocking in “every single one of them,” says Rogen. “Gen V has some really crazy shit in it. The fact that they’re in college, they’re a little younger, makes it more shocking maybe.” There’s no limit to the insanity they’re able to bring onto the screen. “In general, if you’re making an R-rated thing, they let you do whatever the fuck you want, unless there’s some real legal thing that they think you might be bumping against,” Rogen says. “With The Boys, maybe it requires one extra five-minutes phone call, where they’re like, ‘Really?’, and you’re like, ‘Really.’ There are other things you’re on hours of phone calls about that are so much less interesting than that.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcGlyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vdHYvbmV3cy90aGUtYm95cy1zZWFzb24tNC1nZW4tdi1ldmVuLW1vcmUtc2hvY2tpbmctcmVhbGx5LWNyYXp5LXNldGgtcm9nZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-05 15:16:39+00:00,"Box Office: ‘TMNT,’ ‘Meg 2’ Racing Against ‘Oppenheimer’ for Second as ‘Barbie’ Reign Continues","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and ""Meg 2: The Trench"" openings look to take second from ""Oppenheimer,"" as ""Barbie"" stays on top.","The summer box office season may have reached the dog days of August, but it’s hardly looked stronger over the past few months. Though the openings of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Meg 2: The Trench” won’t be able to take down “Barbie” as the top performer in North America, both new releases are boosting theaters to a weekend with four different features grossing north of $25 million.
Paramount Pictures’ “Mutant Mayhem” added $9.3 million from 3,858 locations on Friday, tracking neck-and-neck with “Oppenheimer” for second place on domestic charts. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, opened with Tuesday evening preview screenings and is now tracking for a $42 million five-day debut — squarely within the projections of $35 million to $45 million heading into the weekend.
That’s not shabby for the “TMNT” entry, which cost only $70 million to produce — an especially economical figure for an animated studio release. Paramount has managed to capitalize on strong buzz as both an effective nostalgia play and a modern spin on the ’80s property. The 90% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes brought momentum into the weekend, and the glowing “A” grade through research firm Cinema Score shows early audiences are digging the latest adventures of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. As the summer season winds down, “Mutant Mayhem” should find some steady play.
The “TMNT” entry features a celebrity voice cast including Jackie Chan, Ayo Edebiri, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube and Seth Rogen, plus a group of young stars — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon — voicing the Turtle Brothers, emphasizing the first “T” of “TMNT.” Jeff Rowe directs.
Meanwhile, “Meg 2: The Trench” chowed down on $12 million from 3,503 theaters on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.2 million in Thursday previews. The hungry, hungry sequel from Warner Bros. is still tracking for an opening with a ceiling of $30 million. That’s a chunk behind the 2018 original, which saw Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against two gigantic sharks. “The Meg” earned $45 million in its domestic opening and finished with $145 million in North America and $530 million worldwide.
As its predecessor did, “The Trench,” which sees Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against even more gigantic sharks, will look to international territories as its main course to replenish a $129 million production budget. Notably, the sequel adds Wu Jing to its cast — a colossal star in China who has anchored local mega-hits such as “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” “Wolf Warrior” and “The Wandering Earth.” In fact, though Wu’s character perished in the first “Wandering Earth” entry, its follow-up was conceived as a prequel so that the actor could return to star.
Not that the first “Meg” was an awards season heavyweight, but “The Trench” hasn’t performed well in reviews (a 33% from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences also seem to be cooler on the sequel, turning in a “B” grade on Cinema Score, down from the “B+” earned by the first entry. Consensus opinion may be that the franchise has jumped the… well… but a spectacular reception would’ve marked a bit of a marketing misdirect, to put it frankly.
“Meg 2: The Trench” sees Statham and Wu team up with Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, Cliff Curtis and Sienna Guillory to take down not one, not two, but three prehistoric sharks, along with a bunch of other sea creatures. Beguilingly, the feature is based on a novel, “The Trench” by Steve Alten, and helmed by “Kill List” and “High-Rise” director Ben Wheatley, making the jump to big-budget filmmaking.
Neither sharks nor turtles can take down “Barbie” though, which added $17 million on Friday, down only 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. release has been a dominant force since scoring the biggest opening of the year and there aren’t really any signs of stopping. The hot-pink comedy will likely surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales within the next day or two.
Still the hottest ticket in the nation, “Barbie” should surge beyond a $450 million domestic gross through Sunday, placing it hot on the heels of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) to become the highest-earning North American release of the year.
It’ll be a close call for “Oppenheimer,” which may finally need to surrender second place on domestic charts to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” or “Meg 2: The Trench.” Then again, it may not. The Christopher Nolan feature is projecting $28.7 million for the weekend, which would be down an impressively slim 39% from its previous outing.
The sweeping biopic has surpassed $200 million in North America and looks to keep playing through August, already having extended its tenure in Imax auditoriums. It’s a formidable performance for such a grim chatterbox of a film, which ranks among Nolan’s top four domestic grossers ever after just two weeks of release.
The floor is collapsing under Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which earned $2.6 million on its second Friday, down a staggering 73% from its debut. The family-friendly funhouse feature should push beyond a $40 million domestic gross on Saturday — not exactly the desired return for a film with a $150 million production budget. With plenty of competition for audiences’ attention, “Haunted Mansion” may be off to an early grave.
Notably, the unlikely summer hit “Sound of Freedom” continues to perform well in its sixth weekend of release. Competitors project the feature about child sex trafficking will drop only 39% this weekend, boosting its domestic haul to $164 million — enough to surpass “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” ($156 million) to become one of the top 10 highest-grossing North American releases of the year.
The Angel Studios release has drawn a substantial amount of skepticism among box office watchers. After the credits roll on the thriller, star Jim Caviezel appears on screen to speak directly to audiences, saying that he believes “we can make ‘Sound of Freedom’ the ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of 21st-century slavery” and presenting a QR code that directs viewers to the distributor’s unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing users to donate money to Angel Studios so that it may purchase tickets for its own film and distribute them to those that request free admission. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.
It’s unclear to what degree the program has buoyed the box office fortunes of “Sound of Freedom,” but religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind the feature and a superlative “A+” grade on Cinema Score indicates that its audience is certainly enthusiastic about it. And regardless, those “Pay It Forward” ticket sales are still putting money in the pocket of exhibitors — whether people show up or not.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-06 14:41:04+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Crosses $1B Globally, ‘Meg 2’ and ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Add to Moviegoing Boom",'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' opens to $43 million and 'Meg 2: The Trench' to $30 million as 'Barbie' stays No.,"Turtles and a humongous shark helped fuel another great weekend for moviegoing as the Barbenheimer parade continued.
Greta Gerwig‘s Barbie grossed another $53 million at the domestic box office as it hit $459.4 million in North America and crossed $1 billion globally in a huge win for the filmmakers, Warner Bros. and Mattel. The global number includes an impressive $572.1 million from the foreign box office for a worldwide cume through Sunday of $1.03 billion. It is the second film of the year to cross $1 billion after Universal and Illumination’s family pic The Super Mario Bros ($1.35 billion).
The Barbenheimer parade resulted in another huge moviegoing weekend even as the dual strikes threaten the gains theatrical is making. Combined domestic revenue for all films came in at around $180 million, up a staggering 90 percent from the same frame last year and even 19 percent up over 2019.
Gerwig’s Barbie is the first live-action film in history that’s directed by a woman solo to join the global billion-dollar club. It is already the biggest live-action film of all time domestically for a female director, solo or otherwise, after passing up the $413 million earned by in North America by Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman and the $426 million earned by Captain Marvel, which was directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.
Not often are veteran studio executives rendered speechless, but that’s how movie distribution chiefs Jeff Goldstein and Andrew Cripps described themselves on Sunday. “’Barbillion’ has blown even our most optimistic predictions out of the water,” they said in a statement. Added Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group co-CEOs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy in the statement: “With Barbie becoming the biggest film at the summer box office, Greta now joins an elite group of writer/directors whose singular vision has generated $1 billion at the global box office, a milestone that is a testament to her brilliance and to her commitment to deliver a movie that Barbie fans of every age want to see on the big screen.” (Barbie was mostly done by the time previous movie chief Toby Emmerich and top production executive Courtenay Valenti exited, but Abdy is said to have played a key role regarding certain last-minute production decisions.) And De Luca and Abdy oversee distribution and marketing.
Among all films, Barbie is the 53rd movie in history to cross $1 billion worldwide, and among only a few Warners titles to do so.
Barbie had no trouble staying No. 1 over the Aug. 4-6 weekend, while fellow Warners release Meg 2: The Trench opened in second place domestically with an estimated $30 million, compared to $45 million for 2018 summer success The Meg, which launched amid a far-less-crowded marketplace. The sequel earned a B- CinemaScore, not uncommon for a pic laced with horror.
Overseas, Meg 2 swam off with an impressive $112 million from its first 76 markets — including $26 million in China, a big sum considering the current climate — for a global start of $142 million against a reported budget of $129 million before marketing.
Universal’s Oppenheimer, like Barbie, remained a force of nature in its third outing as it raced past $500 million worldwide. In North America, it earned $28.7 million for a domestic tally of $228.6 million. Overseas, it earned another $52.8 million for an offshore haul of $552.9 million.
The Christopher Nolan-directed pic about the making of the atomic bomb finished Sunday with an estimated global tally of $552.9 million, the top gross ever for a World War II pic ahead of Nolan’s Dunkirk ($527 million) and Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan ($482 million), not adjusted for inflation. And the three-hour film is already the fifth-best showing ever for Nolan domestically, and one of the top biographical dramas of all time, not adjusted. It is also his biggest non-superhero pic in a slew of markets.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, similar to The Meg 2, likewise came in ahead of expectations with a five-day debut of $43.1 million, including $28 million for the three-day weekend. The movie’s performance further cements Paramount’s standout success in the PG space, and depending on where it tops out, should successfully reboot the TMNT big-screen franchise.
The PG-rated pic, written by Seth Rogen and appealing heavily to boys, is one of the best-reviewed studio films of the year and earned a stellar A CinemaScore from audiences. Mutant Mayhem opened mid-week in order to get a jump on the competition. Overseas, it earned $8.2 million from its first raft of markets for an early global tally of $51.3 million, and has little competition in sight.
Mutant Mayhem and Meg 2 are the first movies to feel the full weight of not having stars or influencers able to promote the film in the final three weeks leading up to their release. And the WGA strike presented an additional challenge because of Rogen.
Elsewhere, Disney’s live-action Haunted Mansion continued to scare off audiences. It plunged 63 percent in its sophomore outing to $9 million for a domestic tally of $42 million and $59.6 million globally.
Angel Studios’ sleeper hit Sound of Freedom fell to No. 6 domestically, grossing an estimated $7.6 million in its fifth weekend for a whopping total of $164 million (it has yet to open overseas). It’s still doing more business in North America than Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, which ended its fourth weekend with $151 million in domestic ticket sales and has lost hope of rebounding.
Sony’s Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse celebrated Insidious: The Red Door crossing $182 million at the global box office, including $101.8 million offshore, and becoming the top-grossing Hollywood horror pic of the year to date (M3gan was the previous best at $180 million).

Barbie
Warner Bros.’ comedy declines -43% in its third frame with $53.0M, three-peating in first place.
All time, It’s now earned the:
With $459.3M total through 17 days, it now stands as the #24 biggest movie of all time.
On the all time list, it ranks between 1977’s Star Wars with $460.9M (including subsequent theatrical re-releases) and 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron with $459.0M.
It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $574.1M.
However, Barbie is running +17% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 17-day point in release: $390.3M.
Overseas / global
When Margot Robbie originally pitched her vision of a subversive Barbie adaptation, she jokingly told studio executives that it would “make a billion dollars.” Well, it was no joke.
This weekend, Barbie surpassed the 10-digit mark with $572.1M overseas and $1.03B globally.
Globally, that’s already the #45 film of all time.
On the all time list, it ranks between 2017’s Despicable Me 3 with $1.03B and 2016’s Finding Dory with $1.02B.
It also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie: $1.45B.
Barbie’s top overseas markets totals are:
U.K.: $87.9M Mexico: $48.9M Australia: $41.1M Brazil: $39.5M China: $31.7M Germany: $33.7M France: $29.1M Italy: $27.9M Spain: $26.0M Argentina: $13.0M
This weekend, Barbie declined -41% overseas to $74.0M, slightly milder than its -43% domestic drop.
Meg 2: The Trench
Warner Bros.’ shark-themed thriller took a $30.0M bite out of the box office, opening in second place.
That’s -34% below the debut of 2018’s original The Meg: $45.4M, opening in first place.
Audience demographics
Also compared to the The Meg, the sequel’s audience was:
19% under 18, slightly younger than the original at 15%
Rated the film a “B-” CinemaScore, lower than the original at “B+”
Premium formats made up 40% of the film’s receipts, including 22% from 3D; equivalent stats for The Meg weren’t immediately available
The top five locations nationwide include several unusual ones which are basically never in these types of lists:
Regal Fresno Riverpark AMC Empire NY Regal Dania Pointe Ft. Lauderdale Wellfleet Drive‐In Boston/Cape Cod Regal Warren Moore Oklahoma City
Overseas / global
These kinds of films always earn the vast majority of their money from outside the U.S. and Trench was no exception, opening with $112.0M overseas and $142.0M globally.
That’s a hair (less than +1%) larger than the global opening for 2018’s The Meg: $141.3M. That film also opened in only 42 markets, versus 76 for Trench.
In particular, Trench’s $53.3M China opening is +6% above the original’s $50.3M.
Overseas comprised 79% of the film’s global opening. The original ultimately earned 73% from overseas.
Top overseas market totals are:
China: $53.3M Mexico: $7.6M U.K.: $5.1M France: $4.5M Spain: $3.4M Germany: $3.4M Italy: $2.6M Indonesia: $2.3M Malaysia: $2.2M Australia: $2.1M
Oppenheimer
Universal’s historical war drama declines only -38% to $28.7M, slipping from second to third place in its third frame.
All time, It’s now consistently improved by earning the:
Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M
With $228.5M total through 17 days, it now stands as the #172 biggest movie of all time domestically.
On the all time list, it ranks between 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness with $228.7M and 2015’s The Martian with $228.4M.
It also stands as the #12 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 1973’s The Exorcist with $233.0M (including subsequent theatrical re-releases) and 2017’s Logan with $226.2M.
Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.
Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 17-day point in wide release:
-4% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $240.3M -19% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $285.2M -7% behind 2014’s American Sniper : $247.7M -7% behind 2019’s Joker : $247.2M -14% behind 2017’s It : $266.0M
Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film.
It’s already exceeded the final totals for both 2014’s Interstellar with $188.0M and 2017’s Dunkirk $190.0M, and potentially closing in on 2010’s Inception with $292.5M.
Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest films, through the equivalent 17-day point in wide release:
+18% above 2010’s Inception : $193.3M
+89% above 2014’s Interstellar : $120.9M / +21% ahead of its final total: $188.0M
+71% above 2017’s Dunkirk : $133.0M / +20% ahead of its final total: $190.0M
Oppenheimer is also potentially closing in on another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never reach #1 at a weekend box office.
It already ranks #3 on that metric, behind only:
2016’s Sing : $270.3M, peaking at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 2002’s My Big Fat Greek Wedding : $241.4M, peaking at #2 below Signs , Barbershop , and Swimfan
Overseas / global
This weekend, Oppenheimer declined only -31% overseas, milder than its -38% domestic drop.
Oppenheimer has earned $324.3M overseas and $552.9M globally.
That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M, plus it may soon beat Interstellar with $648M, though matching Inception with $728M will prove harder.
IMAX comprises $144.2M, or 22% of the film’s global total.
Top overseas markets totals are:
U.K.: $50.3M Germany: $28.2M France: $24.1M Australia: $18.1M India: $16.1M Mexico: $14.4M Spain: $13.6M Netherlands: $11.2M Saudi Arabia: $10.1M Brazil: $9.6M
Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China, South Korea, and Italy.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot opened in fourth place with $28.0M.
After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $43.1M after five days. Here’s how that compares to other comparable titles, through the equivalent five-day point in release:
+3% above 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $41.7M
+1% above 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $42.4M
-46% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $79.8M
All three of the most recent Turtles films opened in first place.
Audience demographics
Here are a few of the Mayhem audience stats, compared to those for the last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles release, 2016’s Shadows:
60% male, more than Shadows with 54%
34% under 18, skewing older than Shadows with 40%
Rated the film an “A” CinemaScore, higher than Shadows at “A-”
Premium screens comprised 16% of the box office, including 13% from 3D.
Over-indexing markets included L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin. Seattle and Toronto under-indexed.
Overseas / global
In 24 markets, representing only 30% of the overseas rollout, Mutant debuted with $8.5M overseas and $36.5M globally.
Top markets are U.K. with $5.0M and Germany with $1.0M.

Haunted Mansion
Last weekend, Disney’s family horror-comedy failed to spook with a $24.0M third place debut.
That was even lower than 2003’s original The Haunted Mansion with $24.2M, despite two decades of ticket price inflation.
Now in its sophomore frame, the new version drops a steep -63% to $9.0M and fifth place.
Compared to some other family horror-comedies of recent years, that drop is notably steeper than:
2015’s Goosebumps : -34%
2018’s Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween = -38%
2016’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children : -48%
2018’s The House with a Clock in its Walls : -53%
Haunted Mansion has earned $42.0M total, through 10 days.
That’s +8% above 2003’s original The Haunted Mansion through the equivalent point in release: $38.9M. (Although keep in mind that’s after two decades of ticket price inflation.)
Through the equivalent 10-day point in release, it’s also running:
-18% below 2016’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children : $51.1M
-6% below 2018’s The House with a Clock in its Walls : $44.8M
-4% below 2015’s Goosebumps : $43.7M
Overseas / global
Mansion’s holdover markets fell -56% this weekend, a steep drop though still milder than its -63% domestic drop.
Mansion has earned $17.6M overseas and $59.6M globally.
It may fail to reach its 2003 predecessor’s $155.7M global total, although the reboot’s staggered overseas debut hasn’t yet begun in several key markets including U.K., Italy, Australia, and Japan.
Top overseas market totals are:
France: $3.8M Mexico: $2.3M Germany: $1.4M Spain: $1.1M
Outside the top five
Angel Studios’ faith-based action drama Sound of Freedom takes sixth place with $7.0M in its fifth frame.
With $163.4M after 34 days, Sound is certainly the biggest box office surprise of 2023 so far, beating such expected summer blockbusters as The Flash and the new Mission: Impossible.
Indeed, it’s one of the biggest box office surprises of this entire era.
Paramount’s action-adventure sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One takes seventh place with $6.4M in its fifth frame. It’s earned $151.0M through 26 days.
Here’s how that compares through the equivalent point in release, including trailing both of its two Mission: Impossible predecessors:
-17% below 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout : $183.7M
-5% below 2015’s Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation : $160.0M
+11% above 2021’s No Time to Die : $135.1M
-15% below 2015’s Spectre : $177.7M
-68% behind 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick : $480.7M
A24’s horror Talk to Me fell -40% to $6.2M and eighth place in its sophomore frame.
Among horror films, that’s one of the milder sophomore drops of the post-pandemic era. For A24’s horror films specifically, it’s milder than X (-49%) and Men (-64%), and just slightly steeper than Pearl (-39%).
Disney’s adventure sequel Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes ninth place with $1.5M in its sixth frame. It’s earned $170.6M after 38 days.
Through the same point in release, it’s running -42% below 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: $298.4M.
Disney/Pixar’s animated Elemental takes 10th place with $1.2M in its eighth frame. It’s earned $148.2M through 52 days.
Though poised to finish among Pixar’s lowest-grossing theatrical releases ever, it’s exceeded the final totals of 2022’s Lightyear with $118.3M and 2015’s The Good Dinosaur with $123.0M, despite opening below both titles.

Showtimes started at 2 p.m. for the Jeff Rowe-directed feature, and the outlook is $30M over five days for the net $70M production. Some trackers have it at $40M. Mutant Mayhem is booked at 3,513 locations today and will expand to 3,851 theaters by Friday.
Given the Barbenheimer of it all, you gotta discount some of these movies in the marketplace. Tracking was bullish on Disney’s Haunted Mansion at $30M-$40M before opening, but that was before they knew what Barbenheimer really was. That theme park ride movie opened to $24M, $200K shy of the 2003 version of the film, which did $24.2M (unadjusted for inflation).
Mutant Mayhem, from Nickelodeon and Seth Rogen’s Point Grey, is looking to be the family choice for the long haul into the fall. The movie is tied with Sony’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse as the best reviewed animated features of 2023 at 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and its current audience score is 94%. Props to Paramount: It was the only motion picture studio to brave San Diego Comic-Con sans stars, and it showed off reels of the pic to a near-full house in Hall H.
Warner Bros. has The Meg 2 opening this weekend, industry estimates are in the mid-$20M range. The studio’s Barbie will dominate in its third weekend with around $55M-$60M.
Last weekend during Barbie‘s second frame, she blazed a record final weekend of July of $217M. Last August, Sony’s Bullet Train was the last huzzah before a dead August-into-October, which was left barren of marquee product due to the post-production logjam caused by Covid. This month will be significantly better. The first weekend of August last year did $92M for all movies. Between Meg 2, Barbie, Oppenheimer and Mutant Mayhem alone, this weekend is bound to be well north of $115M.
Barbie led all movies on Tuesday with $15.25M, +2% from Monday, for a running total of $123.2M. She’ll cross the $400M mark on Thursday, the pic’s 14th day in release, faster than the pacing of Top Gun: Maverick and The Super Mario Bros Movie, both of which took 18 days to hit that domestic B.O. benchmark.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtMTIzNTQ1MzEwNy_SAWJodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLTEyMzU0NTMxMDcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER , Universal Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection
Unfortunately, the tanking of Amblin/Universal’s $45M-costing The Last Voyage of the Demeter stands out like a wart, since we haven’t had many misfires this summer. Granted, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s profitability might be in question next to their exorbitant Covid costs. But these pics have put up tentpole grosses in the nine digits, and have been mass draws (just not as massive as they were hoped to be). Note the filmmakers aimed to keep this period horror pic as cheap as they could: Exteriors were shot in Malta, while interior were shot in Germany, both those countries respectively having tax credits of 50% and 30%.
What makes the $6.5M opening here for Demeter more pronounced is simply given the fact that it’s the only major studio-wide entry this weekend. Note, we’ve known due to tracking that this vampire ship pic was headed for the cliffs.
Look, Amblin makes these elevated genre mid-budget size movies, not necessarily as thrifty as Blumhouse. There was Captive State, which was made for $25M and was released pre-spring 2019 and fell down with a global gross less than $9M. Amblin had some money in that film, but it was largely financed by Participant.
Then there was the under-$10M horror pic, Come Play, which was released when major movie capitals like NYC and L.A. weren’t opened. That grossed $13.1M WW, and I’m told it broke even thanks to vibrant PVOD during the pandemic, and everyone watching at home. Demeter will have to look to the saving grace of downstream ancillaries. Remember, if there’s anything that theatrical day-and-date taught us, it’s that it’s always better to release theatrically, prop the pic’s profile, bomb, and make money thereafter.

Sitting in a movie theater this summer and watching a rhythmic flow of riveting trailers, including not just Barbie and Oppenheimer, but also Sony’s upcoming (what looks-to-be hysterical) holiday romantic comedy, Anyone But You, starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell — then the trailer for Demeter hits the screen and screeches all fun to a halt. What is this overly dark Master and Commander clipper ship type movie? ‘What’s a Demeter?’ one asks. Then two minutes into the trailer, just before you’re about to doze off, one’s response is ‘Oh, it’s about Dracula.’ That was one of the biggest problems I found in the marketing: The trailer was a huge ‘do-not-see-this-movie,’ especially with the non-starry cast (another hurdle for this horror pic).
However, this movie is from the genius marketing team who turned M3GAN into a phenomenon when the country was in a deep-freeze this past winter, and whenever a trailer can’t deliver, it’s because there aren’t enough materials in the film for a studio’s marketing team to harness. It’s not marketing’s fault, it’s the film’s fault. At the end of the day, period horror is a hurdle, as it’s too elevated to excite core 18-34 horror fans, and too low bar to pull in sophisticated audiences — even if you have stars (case in point Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak –$13.1M opening, $31M domestic on a $55M production cost). Filmmaker André Øvredal was able to delight back in early August 2019 with a PG-13 young adult movie, Scary Stories (which by the way, it’s set in 1968, which isn’t as period for a horror movie and a turnoff as clipper ship times).
There is a feeling by some close to the film that the studio got cold feet in propping Demeter this summer. However, audience diagnostics are diagnostics coming out of testing, and marketing budgets are appropriately allocated to those stats as studios look to keep a low overhead on a feature heading into the streaming window.
There were champions of Demeter who tried to get the good word out, i.e. del Toro and Stephen King, who praised the pic on social media:
I enjoyed Last Voyage of the Demeter so much: gorgeous, lavish and savage!! — Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) August 10, 2023
I was doubtful about THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER, but it's a throat-ripping good time. It reminded me of the best of the Hammer movies from the 60s and 70s. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) August 10, 2023
In addition to critics who aren’t fans of Demeter, audiences are asleep, too, with a B- CinemaScore and 66% positive on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak. Guys bought tickets at 62%, 52% of the 18-34 demo was present, and 25-34 year olds were the largest quad at 32%. Diversity mix was 44% Caucasian, 25% Latino and Hispanic, 16% Black, and 16% Asian/other. Demeter played strongest in the South, South Central and West. The annual income for a part-time entry level worker at McDonalds is higher than what this movie made at the AMC Burbank since Thursday (Demeter‘s highest grossing venue) which is under $12.5K so far.
There’s no need for the studio to use the excuse that stars weren’t available to promote because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, for it remains to be seen whether or not they would have moved the meter on this title. The pic’s problems are inherent. As Deadline film critic Valerie Complex points out about Demeter, “The visual palette drenched in melancholic grays and blues are effective in creating atmosphere, but the film falls prey to predictability.” She also observes that her journey on the Demeter “feels longer than it actually is.”
Furthermore, Universal did push Demeter as much as they could. The pic trailered on movies like Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible in-theaters. The trailer trended #10 on YouTube, generated 90+ press breaks, and garnered more than 61M views. Spots ran on such TV shows as American Ninja Warrior, America’s Got Talent, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia finale, Mayans finale, The Walking Dead: Dead City finale, Shark Week, Big Brother premiere, and The Challenge premiere. On streaming, spots ran on such shows as The Bear, What We Do in the Shadows and Only Murders in the Building.
In the sports arena, Demeter floated into a UFC 291 PPV sponsorship (including coveted spot right before the match begins, lower thirds, billboards, announcer callouts), NBA Finals Games 2&5, MLB All-Star Game, WWE RAW, League’s Cup, All Elite Wrestling: Rampage, Boxing PPV Spence v. Crawford Sponsorship, UFC Fight Night, NFL Hall of Game. While on streaming, the campaign also had placements in NBC’s NFL streaming coverage and a sponsorship of Peacock’s WWE Summer Slam.
Despite all noble efforts here by Uni — no one’s buying tickets for a trip on the Demeter. Amblin’s linear cable deal is with Showtime, so Demeter won’t end up on Peacock. Onward to PVOD, Ho!
David Harbour stars in Columbia Pictures GRAN TURISMO. Gordon Timpen/Sony
Some trivia: Sony’s Gran Turismo, which was suppose to come out this weekend but was pushed to Aug. 25 because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, has been playing sneaks, just like the Culver City lot promised. I’m told there were Imax early access screenings on Wednesday, regular sneaks on Thursday. Today, there’s a 2 PM at the Regal North Hollywood, LA Live, and TCL Chinese Theatre. Where will the extra money be counted? I understand it will be in the end-running total. The Playstation Studios movie opened abroad with $10.7M from 4,900+ screens in 30 markets. France led all markets with a strong $2.3 million, followed by the UK with $1.3 million. Australia and Germany both launched with $1.0 million.
The chart is updating with Sunday figures, indicated by Saturday and Sunday figures:
1 Barbie (WB) 4,178 theaters – Fri $10M (-38%) Sat $13.2M Sun $10.5M, 3-day $33.7M (-36%), Total $526.3M/Wk 4

This action comedy in126 markets put up some big numbers in Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco, Austin, NYC, Chicago and LA.
FRIDAY EVENING: We told you earlier the Greta Gerwig directed Barbie is crossing $500M today. As of Tuesday, the film became the highest ever at the domestic box office for a female director, besting Frozen II‘s $477.4M, which was co-directed by Jennifer Lee. Barbie is crossing $1.13 billion worldwide today, also delivering another box office record to Gerwig, as the pic became the highest grossing live-action pic from a female filmmaker on a global basis, besting Captain Marvel‘s $1.13 billion, that title co-directed by Anna Boden.
Barbie crosses the half billion point stateside in 22 days, faster than Top Gun: Maverick (30 days) and Super Mario Bros Movie (31 days). Barbie is only one of 20 titles to ever cross half billion at the domestic box office. She’s set to lead the U.S./Canada box office with $30M this weekend.
‘The Last Voyage of the Demeter’ Courtesy of Universal
Meanwhile, as expected, Amblin/Universal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter is deep-sixing with $6.5M. Critics loated it at 45% Rotten. Audiences haven’t even expressed if they liked it or not on Rotten Tomatoes, which is an ugly sign. RelishMix reports that social media metrics for the period horror pic are tracking under under horror genre norms by 15% at 118.5M across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok combined. It also doesn’t help that the cast can’t promote on an original film on social media. This is a problem that Meg 2 and Teenage Mutant Turtles didn’t face as they were known pieces of IP; they can be sold strictly off their trailers.
RelishMix’s report on Demeter‘s online chatter before opening: “It runs mixed-leaning-positive, as horror fans are applauding Dracula’s ‘badass’ makeover and thrilled that vampires are getting their fangs back, shedding their softer, more cuddly recent depictions. The R-rating is also adding to the anticipation, promising a darker, more intense experience. Aisling Franciosi, has won some hearts from her previous work (GOThrones) — where are a few grumbles about the vampire’s big reveal in the trailer and the film’s dark cinematography, but this isn’t dampening the general enthusiasm — with some jabs about the CGI, while most threads steer positive.”
Here’s the chart:
1 Barbie (WB) 4,178 theaters – Fri $10M (-38%), 3-day $30M (-43%), Total $522.6M/Wk 4
2) Oppenheimer (Uni) 3,761 theaters, Fri $5M (-40%), 3-day $16.8M (-42%), Total $262.2M/Wk 4
3) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Par) 3,950 theaters, Fri $3.9M (-57%), 3-day $14.1M (-50%), Total $71.1M/Wk 2
4) The Meg 2 (WB) 3,604 theaters, Fri $3.5M (-71%), 3-day $12M (-60%), Total $53.5M/Wk 2
5) Last Voyage of the Demeter (Amb/Uni) 2,715 theaters, Fri $2.65M 3-day $6.5M/Wk 1
FRIDAY AM UPDATE: The only new wide release this weekend is Amblin’s period Dracula horror pic The Last Voyage of the Demeter being distributed by Universal. It made $750K last night in previews from showtimes that began at 5PM in 2,350 theaters in what is expected to be an underwhelming 3-day single digit million result for the $45M feature production. The R-rated pic expands to 2,715 theaters today.
That preview result is in the vicinity of last August’s vampire horror movie, The Invitation, which did $775K in previews, a $6.8M opening and $25.1M final domestic.
Why is this period horror film on the calendar? Because it’s from horror filmmaker André Øvredal. He excited the early August box office back in 2019 with Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. That movie from the shuttering CBS Studios label did an amazing $2.3M in previews for what turned out to be a $20.9M No. 2 opening in the face of the second weekend of Hobbs & Shaw. The sleeper PG-13 horror pic did close to $69M in U.S./Canada and $104.5M WW on what was a $25M production cost.
‘Barbie’ Warner Bros. Pictures
You’ll remember, Sony’s Gran Turismo moved off this date and opted for two weeks of sneaks before an Aug. 25 launch in an effort to build word of mouth for the feature take of the Sony Playstation game. No bother, as Warner Bros’ Barbie is expected to reign supreme in weekend 4 with $31.8M as she heads for half-billion stateside today. The Greta Gerwig-directed feature take of the Mattel toy has already cracked the $1 billion worldwide box office mark with just under $32M from China. Barbie did $7.1M yesterday at 4,178 theaters, -3% from Wednesday, for a running total through three weeks of $492.6M.
‘Oppenheimer’, courtesy Universal. Universal
Universal’s Oppenheimer is also expected to ease -40% in its fourth weekend with around $17.5M at 3,612 theaters. The Christopher Nolan directed three-hour drama in Imax and 70M made an estimated $3.6M yesterday, -3% from Wednesday for a three-week total of $245.4M.
With more theatrical release date changes expected for the rest of 2023, one distribution head wisely remarked this week, “Watch Barbie and Oppenheimer play through Thanksgiving.”
Some box office trivia: Oppenheimer became the highest grossing film at Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre in the venue’s 97-year history hiting $1.53M on Wednesday. That beats the previous record at the venue set by 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens which earned $1.51M after 15 weeks of release. Oppenheimer has been extended at the TCL Chinese Theatre in IMAX 70mm film through the end of August.
“It’s been a historic run for us at the TCL Chinese with weeks of sold-out shows. We’ve added 6am shows for the last four weekends to satisfy audience demand,” says Brett Fellman, executive with the TCL Chinese Theatres.
Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem should also be down around 40% for a near $17M second weekend. Through its first nine days, the Nickelodeon/Point Grey animated pic did $57M at 3,858 theaters. Turtles did $2.7M yesterday, even with Wednesday.
Warner Bros’ The Meg 2: The Trench is eyeing a 60% decline in weekend two for $12M. Week one for the surprise No. 2 pic last weekend is $41.4M. Thursday was $2.1M, -3% from Wednesday, in fourth place for the day at 3,503.
Disney’s Haunted Mansion, booked at 3,740 theaters, made an estimated $1M, +2% from Wednesday for a two-week running total of $47.2M.
The Tamil language action comedy Jailer from Nelson Dilipkumar opened in 375 theaters on Wednesday doing an estimated $961K, followed by $627K yesterday for a two-day of $1.58M.

Paramount and Nickelodeon’s animated adventure is getting a jump on the weekend by debuting on Wednesday. This weekend’s other new release, the Warner Bros. shark sequel “Meg 2: The Trench,” lands in theaters on Friday.
“Mutant Mayhem” is projected to pick up $35 million to $45 million over its first five days of release. Meanwhile, “Meg 2” is targeting a three-day start of $25 million to $30 million. Those films will vie for second place on box office charts alongside Christopher Nolan’s historical drama “Oppenheimer,” now in its third weekend of release.
Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” which is expected to top the box office for the third straight weekend, added a leading $12.8 million on Wednesday. The fantasy comedy, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the stereotypical versions of Barbie and Ken, has generated $394 million in North America, making it the second-highest grossing movie of the year. It’s the third-biggest 2023 release at the global box office with $811 million.
The PG “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” adaptation cost $70 million, which is more economical than other summer blockbusters. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the creative team behind “Superbad,” wrote and produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” The film, featuring a sprawling voice cast of Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan and Ice Cube, follows the Turtle brothers, who set out to conquer the streets of New York City after spending years sheltered from the human world.
“Meg 2: The Trench” carries a $130 million production budget and will rely on the international box office to turn a profit in its theatrical run. The original 2018 shark thriller “The Meg” opened to $45 million before becoming a surprise smash to the tune of $145 million domestically and $530.5 million globally.

Variety reports that Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies are planning to produce a Mutant Mayhem follow-up film as well as an all-new streaming series that will serve as the connective tissue between the two movies. The 2D series — Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — has already been greenlit for two seasons, produced by Nickelodeon Animation and Point Grey Pictures, and will be co-showrun and executive produced by Chris Yost and Alan Wan.
Actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon will also be reprising their roles as Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael, and the show will reportedly follow as each of the Turtles try flying solo for the first time in their lives.
The rush to get more of the Mutant Mayhem-era Turtles on people’s screens is very in line with Paramount CEO Brian Robbins’ recent comments about the company seeing value in trying to cater to millennials with revamped pieces of established IP. But considering how much of the excitement around the new movie is wrapped up in its unique 3D aesthetic, a 2D spinoff might not necessarily be what audiences are looking for.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzcvMjYvMjM4MDg2OTQvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tYXloZW0tc2VxdWVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

By the way, that’s for 2023 YTD alone, all built by Paramount.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem‘ Paramount Pictures / courtesy Everett Collection
As we told you, the launch of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reps a big win for the Brian Robbins-led Paramount Pictures Studios, as he builds out and breathes new lives into franchises.
Since 2012 and not including 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles global merchandise sales have amassed $8 billion, per industry sources. This was accomplished during Paramount’s ownership of the TMNT IP that they it acquired in 2009.
Paramount transitioned the Turtles business from predominantly collectors to mass retail, and natch, the latest reboot has catapulted demand from TMNT fans and partners alike. In the U.S. and Canada alone, industry projections think Mutant Mayhem, a co-production with Nickelodeon and Seth Rogen’s Point Grey, could exceed $110M.
Paramount Consumer Products’ Turtles theatrical program was its most ambitious yet, counting north of 400 licensees for the film and 1,100 total for the franchise.
Among those platinum licensees with Turtles merchandise tied to Mutant Mayhem were Playmates, Hasbro, Mattel, Crayola, Funko, Crocs, General Mills and more. Their products hit the global store shelves of Walmart, Target, Amazon, Macy’s, Kroger, Kohl’s, Primark, Smyths, The Entertainer, Soriana, Big W, Iden, Toys R Us, Mercado Libre and others.
In addition to action figures, the Mutant Mayhem product range also included Build-a-Bear.
In sum, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles products are available in more than 550 retailers, totaling 40,000 retail doors, in more than 220 markets worldwide.
Gaming integrations for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles included Minecraft, The Sims FreePlay, Fruit Ninja, Match Masters and more. Publishing partnerships included Random House, Bendon and IDW. There was a launch of TMNT: Battle Tycoon on Roblox from ParaG Game Division in partnership with Gamefam.
Paramount Global delivered over a half-billion impressions for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles across domestic CBS, adult networks and social. TMNT marathons aired across domestic Nick channels in addition there were marketing and activations across all foreign platforms. A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles YouTube channel was launched, and now counts 2.66M subscribers. Paramount’s PlutoTV showcased iterations of the TMNT 2012, 2019 and 1987 series.

Eastman announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Paramount and Nick secured full rights to air the original cartoon series from the 1980s. Speaking of Comic-Con, Paramount was the only studio to have the guts to take a film down to Hall H and strut out footage for fans with director Jeff Rowe. Such a promotional opportunity was lost by rival motion picture studios, who shied away from the fanboy confab during the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes with a majority of talent unavailable to promote. Still, 135,000 attendees showed up at SDCC.
Meanwhile, the Paramount+ streaming service featured the full collection of TMNT with four series and eight movies in the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia, Latin America, Brazil, Italy and South Korea among others. There was more vertical integration power across the Viacom empire for Mutant Mayhem with the pic’s promotion at Nickelodeon resorts and attractions around the world in the U.S., UK and Italy.
Separately, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem counted a promotional partner campaign worth north of $100M in media value from myriad brand partners drawing 3 billion impressions, robust for an animated movie. And that’s without a big automobile advertiser. Earlier this summer, Disney/Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, a live-action title, counted a $118M promo partner campaign.
Among the notable brand partners for Mutant Mayhem were Pizza Hut. The team-up involved animators authentically integrating Pizza Hut into the movie. Pizza Hut also blasted off a 360-degree TMNT campaign by bringing back the fan favorite Big New Yorker pizza and supported that limited-time menu with activations across linear and digital platforms within the Paramount portfolio. There were four media spots including a 30-second custom animated spot. In addition, there were custom pizza boxes featuring an AR mobile gaming experience. There were also TMNT co-branded Pizza Vans that passed out pizza to fans at San Diego Comic-Con and other high-profile events across the country. Twenty-two international markets featured bespoke local spots, advertising, delivery stunts and limited-edition pizzas inspired by the movie, like the Mutagen Pizza in Australia.
The Xbox global campaign counted the first time-ever innovation of pizza-scented video game controllers with custom designs featuring each of the pic’s four heroes in a half-shell. Influencers led a campaign for a “retweet and win sweepstakes” that went viral across the web. In addition, Xbox executed a TMNT fan event at its NYC Microsoft flagship store on 5th Avenue on the pic’s opening day which included movie content via storefront billboards and a TMNT-themed gaming lounge with controllers on display. There was also a collaboration between TMNT and Pizza Hut for an apparel collection available at Primark.
Turtles eat bugs, hence P&G’s Zevo flying insect traps proved an ideal partner. It was the product’s first film partnership ever. The campaign featured a fully integrated 30-second spot that aired across linear and digital media platforms.
Among the local international highlights was Old El Paso’s “Ninja-Proof Tortilla Pockets” in the UK and France, which saw 1.2 million themed packs in 20,000 major supermarket locations and on Amazon.
Brazil’s Gol Airlines let fans “Fly In Mutant Time” onboard a fully customized Mutant Mayhem plane. The stunt was promoted in major airports, print and online.
Chargespot, the largest charging station brand in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan, called on teens and young adults to “Get Charged” at 27,000 customized charging stations.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem grossed $15.2M this past weekend at the domestic box office, repping a nice -45% ease for a 12-day running total of $72.3M. Through seven movies, the TMNT franchise has grossed over $1.2 billion at the worldwide box office.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1yZXRhaWwtc2FsZXMtMTIzNTUxOTIzMy_SAVZodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtcmV0YWlsLXNhbGVzLTEyMzU1MTkyMzMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 16:00:00+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: Seth Rogen Puts His Comedic Stamp On The Best TMNT Movie Yet,"A Review of the latest film version of a beloved franchise, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg make it fresh.","In a summer where the off-the-boards success of original movies including Barbie and Oppenheimer is all the rage, the seventh-or so feature film iteration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise wasn’t one with great expectations. Except when you read the credit block and discover the co-writers and producers are none other than Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and the director is Jeff Rowe, who most recently was an Oscar nominee for the wildly inventive animated hit The Mitchells vs The Machines.
They have delivered exactly what you might hope they would: a fiendishly clever, funny but appropriately faithful take on a brand that just hasn’t quit since coming into the world as a modest comic book in 1983 from the minds of Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. Their little creation has spawned countless comics, TV series, all those feature films, video games, toys, bedsheets — you name it. Several generations have been weaned on them, especially boys, and now we have a new toon that takes pride in emphasizing the teenage in the title. It also has lots of heart.
Rogen’s and longtime partner Goldberg’s script is heavy on pop culture humor in all the best ways but takes a cue as well from the youth emphasis of the Tom Holland Spider-Man as well as the hit animated versions. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is young to its core, virtually reinventing the concept right down to the casting of the voice actors in the four title roles.
Fans will not be disappointed with any of the decisions here, notably the scattershot animation that feels rough around the edges, stylish, visually surprising and satisfying and anti-CGI blandness. The producers said they were going for a look that a high school student might have drawn for fun in their notebook. It is all on the screen here thanks to Owen, his co-director Kyler Spears, production designer Yashar Kassai and the talented team of animators, particularly the character department.
Storywise, the screenplay written by Rogen, Goldberg and Jeff Rowe, Dan Hernandez & Benji Samit finds New York is being terrorized by criminal mastermind Superfly (voiced ferociously by Ice Cube), one of many mutant creatures determined to end humans any way he can. He plans to do it with his crew — characters that will be familiar to TMNT fans everywhere — including Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Ray Fillet (Post Malone hilariously singing his name), Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou) and Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress). Good buddy Be Bop, the mutated Warthog, is voiced by Rogen, and it isn’t his first rodeo as that particular creature (remember Pumbaa in The Lion King?), and Rock Steady gets life from John Cena.
The plot revolves around TMNT veteran April O’Neil (The Bear Emmy nominee Ayo Edebiri), the reporter in previous versions who here has been aged down considerably to also being a teen with high ambition to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. She gets her chance when she encounters the TMNT quartet, who have been sheltered by adoptive father Splinter (voiced by the great Jackie Chan), the mutated rat who befriended them when they were toddlers and who were the only ones who liked the rat. Oozed into the sewer, they all live down there munching on their beloved pizza but are taught to distrust and hate humans. In April, though, they find one they like, and her plan is to use them to seek out Superfly, do him in and become the basis for a major news scoop that will catapult her — and them — to glory.
This all does lead to the Ninja Turtles’ encounter with Superfly and his gang. The villain actually takes a liking to them at first, thinking that since they became mutants at about the same period 15 years earlier (where the film begins its pre-credits sequence) they actually are cousins. Soon, though, Superfly’s true intentions and dark side takes over, and the battle is on.
I have to say I found this version of the Turtles to be irresistible, each one very specifically and distinctly drawn and voiced with excellent work from the young actors including Nicolas Cantu (The Fabelmans) as natural leader Leonardo, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Brady Noon as Raphael and Micah Abbey as Donatello. Losing some of the bulk and imposing look of some of the past creations of this foursome, they are all truly believable as excited teens looking to find their way in a world they are just beginning to experience.
Rogen has made his mark on a franchise that still finds new ways to smartly entertain amid all that mayhem.

2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.
Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.
Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.
Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.
The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”
Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.
Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”
There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.
On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).
Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.
Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.
Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)
“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

2023-07-27 17:26:39+00:00,Weekend Box Office Forecast (Updated): BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER Pace for Historic Second Frame as HAUNTED MANSION Courts Family Audiences,"After a historic weekend at the box office that set a post-pandemic record with $311.3 million in overall ticket sales, the ""Barbenheimer"" craze looks to carry over into a strong second frame for both films. At the same time, Disney counters with Haunted Mansion in a late summer play for family moviegoers.","Courtesy of Warner Bros and Universal Pictures
Thursday Update: The coming weekend looks to again rank among the best yet in the post-pandemic era as Barbie and Oppenheimer‘s weekday performances indicate even stronger holds than initially projected this week.
As the tandem continues to catch spillover demand from at- and near-capacity screenings throughout their first week of release, another historic weekend is on deck for the box office as a whole.
Behind last weekend’s $311.3 million market haul, the top overall moviegoing weekends since 2019 are:
December 17 – 19, 2022 ($283 million)
July 8 – 10, 2022 ($238.4 million)
May 6 – 8, 2022 ($222.3 million)
June 10 – 12, 2022 ($214.9 million)
November 11 – 13, 2022 ($209.5 million)
June 2 – 4, 2023 ($205.2 million)
April 7 – 9, 2023 ($205.1 million)
Remarkably, all of those frames were primarily driven by the opening weekend performance of tentpole films. That will not be the case this time.
The most comparable period to the weekend ahead will be May 3 – 5, 2019. That was Avengers: Endgame‘s second weekend of release, and the market grossed an overall $199.9 million. Endgame accounted for $147.4 million of that revenue as a holdover with the second best-ever second weekend gross in history.
While it’s important to view each film individually on many levels, Barbie and Oppenheimer are on pace to approach that figure between them in their second weekend showings. Combined with the debut of Haunted Mansion and healthy holds from other films in their chase weekends, the market overall should crack $200 million again with a considerable shot to land among the top five post-pandemic box office weekends.
In response to this incredibly unique run by both films, final forecasts and target ranges below have been revised ahead of the weekend’s official start.
Wednesday Morning: After a historic weekend at the box office that set a post-pandemic record with $311.3 million in overall ticket sales, the “Barbenheimer” craze looks to carry over into a strong second frame for both films. At the same time, Disney counters with Haunted Mansion in a late summer play for family moviegoers.
Barbie
2nd Weekend Range: $80M-$95M
Oppenheimer
2nd Weekend Range: $45M-$55M
Haunted Mansion
Walt Disney Pictures
July 28, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $22M-$36M
PROS:
Widespread familiarity with the source material will be an advantage in Disney’s attempt to bring another one of their signature theme park rides to the big screen, for the second time in Mansion‘s case.
Timing is favorable given the lack of family-driven options at the box office right now.
A strong ensemble cast adds appeal for parents and adults, in addition to the family audiences being targeted.
Pre-sales are encouraging, with a pace comparable to Pixar’s Elemental last month and Disney’s Jungle Cruise back in July 2021.
CONS:
With a late review embargo lift, critics are divided on the film. The Rotten Tomatoes meter sits at 49 percent from 70 reviews as of Wednesday afternoon.
Opening a film that’s thematically more fit for the Halloween period in the late summer is a somewhat questionable decision.
Staying power could be impacted by the arrival of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem in theaters next week.
Current projection ranges call for a 30% to 40% decrease from last weekend’s $307.8 million top ten aggregate.
Please note that previous forecast ranges for Barbie ($75 million to $90 million with a pinpoint of $79.1 million) and Oppenheimer ($42 million to $57 million with a pinpoint of $44.6 million) have been updated in this report.

2023-08-06 14:35:00+00:00,"2023 Domestic Box Office Surges Past $6 Billion This Weekend Due To ‘Barbie’, ‘Oppenheimer’, ‘Turtles’ & ‘Meg 2’ As Strikes Continue – Sunday Update","The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.' Barbie jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in day 14. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Eyes Second With $30M 3-day, $45M 5-day.","Sunday AM Writethrough after Saturday AM update: As the Hollywood labor stoppage continues, the 2023 box office rally rages on, as domestic box office soars past $6 billion, +22% over the same January-August period a year ago. This weekend for all movies stands at an estimated $178M. This is the fourth time in box office history to have four movies cross $25M; the last time was Thanksgiving weekend 2018.
We always knew this weekend would beat the first frame of August a year ago ($92M), and that’s happening at +94%. But the current Friday-Sunday is also kicking the first weekend of August 2019’s $148.99M by +20%, and that’s when Hobbs & Shaw ruled the chart.
Barbie remains box office queen bee with $53M in weekend 3, after a $17M Friday and $20M Saturday. By EOD, Barbie is roughly $40M shy from passing the half billion mark at the domestic box office, with her gross set to stand at $459.4M. A $1 billion running global cume happens today!
That fierce battle for second place we saw yesterday between Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Oppenheimer, and The Meg 2: The Trench is settling down.
The second place winner is Meg 2 with $30M, an amazing one-two punch for the weekend by Warner Bros. No one was expecting Meg 2 to rank in second place. Here’s the takeaway with Meg 2 this weekend: For all those studios clutching their pearls and worried about stars not doing press and looking to dynamite the rest of the 2023 calendar. Meg 2‘s opening was achieved off a screening program campaign, with in-theater and online trailers and TV spots. I hear that Jason Statham and the cast didn’t do that much press here in the U.S. Such is the plus of opening a sequel off the gas of its established IP. The first Meg‘s campy comedic marketing campaign five years ago already did the heavy lifting in establishing the brand. The sequel’s trailers just needed to run with it.
Beamed Jeff Goldstein, Domestic Distribution President of Warner Bros, “This is an extraordinary time for Barbie fans, as the blowout parties continue. Meg 2 delivered the one-two punch and scared audiences everywhere.”
Uni’s Oppenheimer is third with $28.7M. Since opening, per EntTelligene, Barbenheimer, has pulled in 55.5M moviegoers. Broken out, that’s 39M for Barbie and another 16.5M for Oppenheimer.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, after a great Saturday of $10.3M, +11% over Friday’s $9.3M, is coming in at $28M over 3-days and $43M, which is still great for this $70M production.
Wow, that was easy. Everyone played nice. Typically, when there’s a tie in an upper ranking, especially No. 1, it’s a game of chicken among the majors on Sunday morning when calling it. More specifically, there’s a delay in reporting, with snarking all around. One of the more notorious fights over first in recent memory was the weekend of Sept. 29-Oct. 1, 2017 when the opening of Tom Cruise’s American Made, the fourth weekend of It, and the second weekend of Kingsman: The Golden Circle were all ranking in the high $16M range. Kingsman won with $16.935M.
Turtles is a huge win for the Brian Robbins Paramount administration, particularly as he builds out and revives franchises.
Said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s domestic distribution boss, “We’re over the moon with this opening. We exceeded pre-release expectations with this movie, which has been a labor of love for a long time.”
The decision to revive Turtles happened back in 2018, when Robbins was at Nickelodeon with Ramsey Naito, current president, Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation, and they sparked to the idea of Seth Rogen’s involvement, as well as filmmaker Jeff Rowe — both lifelong fans — who truly wanted to lean into the ‘teenage’ part of the IP. Paramount, like all their movies this year, has gotten behind promoting the animated pic 200%, having Rogen show off extended footage at CineamCon, and a work-in-progress cut at Annecy back in June. Props to Paramount: They were the only studio who realized that there would be a full-house crowd down at San Diego Comic-Con: fans unfazed by the strikes. So they took Turtles down to Hall H and showed off more footage to fans with Rowe in tow, as well as TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman — the latter who just stoked the crowd. Why skip an opportunity? Very smart on the Melrose lot for being fearless and creative sans stars in their promotion. Rival studios, take note.

The second animated take of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak audience score of 88% positive and a 70% recommend, with kids under 12 giving it 94%, and a 69% must-see. That’s enough ooze to keep chugging into the fall. That’s on top of the pic’s already “A” CinemaScore. Men showing up at 60% to women’s 40%, with 56% of the crowd between 18-34. The biggest demo is 18-24 at 34%. Diversity demos are 33% Caucasian, a great 33% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black, and 16% Asian/other. The South Central and the West are the most robust here for the Nickelodeon/Point Grey production. Oppenheimer still has Imax, but the Turtles have PLFs, which are driving 16% of ticket sales and another 11% from 3D. Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing movie theater in the nation at $103K-plus so far. Cowabunga.
TMNT:MM saw Canada delivering 5% of the gross with major markets that over-indexed being L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin, while the only major markets that under-indexed were Seattle and Toronto. Top theaters came from L.A., N.Y., Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, Pharr, Texas, El Paso, Nashville, San Antonio, and Houston.
Social media analytics corp RelishMix says that Turtles’ social media universe is 309.8M across Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok combined. Ahead of release, RelishMix said those stats were under family animated averages. But clearly there’s an appetite here for the movie, as it’s greatly over-performing.

PostTrak audiences gave Meg 2 72% in the top two boxes, with a 55% recommend, and a B- to the first chapter’s B+. South Central and South are the biggest-grossing regions. Note, there’s a lot of walk-up business here, like there was on the first movie, from the Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who are showing up at 25% to Caucasian 41%, Black 15%, and Asian American at 13%. Warners does have some PLFs for the shark that are shared with the Turtles, accounting for 22.5% of the overall gross with another 18% coming from 3D screens. The Regal Fresno Riverpark is leading the pack with $39K in gross (including early shows) so far.
RelishMix counts a social media universe for the sequel of 350.8M, 14% above genre averages next to action-adventure sci-fi titles, with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on the high end at 611.3M SMU. “Chatter flows positive on The Meg 2, which makes new waves as the audacious, over-the-top shark sequel being hailed as a high-octane escape into ‘stupid-crazy-fun entertainment’ with endless positive snarky threads. The return of Jason Statham draws a splash as fans gush, ‘Looks amazing, especially with Jason Statham in this epic shark movie.'” reports RelishMix.
Jason Statham, who counts 111M fans on social media, got this modest plug in for the film on Instagram before the SAG-AFTRA strikes began:

Warner Bros
FRIDAY MIDDAY: The third weekend of Warner Bros’ Barbie at $51M (-45%) is higher than the opening of the Brad Pitt action movie, Bullet Train, which did $30M during the first weekend of August. It just goes to show how far we’ve come along at the box office. The Greta Gerwig directed take on the Mattel doll is eyeing a third Friday of $16M at 4,178 theaters, -45% from a week ago. Running total by Sunday will be $457.4M.
Universal’s Oppenheimer will hold on to third place at 3,612 theaters with a $7.8M third Friday (-42%), and third weekend of $27M, -42%, sending its running total by Sunday to $226.8M. Pic is director Christopher Nolan’s fourth highest domestic besting Batman Begins and Dunkirk. It’s also the highest grossing R-rated film of 2023 domestically ahead of John Wick Chapter 4 ($187.1M). Oppenheimer also reps the fastest Universal R-rated release to cross $200M in U.S./Canada, taking 15 days. Previous R-rated $200M Uni champ was 2012’s Ted, which took 37 days to that benchmark.
Third at 3,858 theaters is Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with a first Friday of $8.5M, 3-day of $27M, and 5-day of $42M, well ahead of its $30M-$40M expectations. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is 94% to go along with that A CinemaScore.
Warner Bros‘ The Meg 2: The Trench at 3,503 theaters is a seeing an $11M Friday, including previews, and a $25M opening — robust for the marketplace. Audiences are so-so on it so far at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s better than the 43% the first movie notched with RT crowds.
Disney’s second weekend of The Haunted Mansion at 3,740 is seeing a second estimated Friday of $2.8M,-72%, second weekend of $9.5M, -60%, for a running total of $42.5M.
FRIDAY AM: Barbie Crosses $400M, Oppenheimer Nears $200M, Turtles 2-day $15M, Meg 2 Previews $3M+ The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.’ Barbie, after a $11.8M Thursday, jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in her 14th day –faster than Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie– with a running total of $406.4M at 4,337 locations.
She’s poised to make around $55M in her third weekend, with Oppenheimer ringing in at least another $23M+; all of this spelling for a 3-day box office marketplace that will be exceedingly well north of last year’s $92M for the first weekend of August. The Christopher Nolan-directed movie earned $5.58M yesterday at 3,647 theaters taking its two-week total to $199.86M.
Warner Bros. also has some lagniappe at the weekend box office with The Meg 2: The Trench which is expected to do between $20M-$30M. Last night from previews that began at 3PM, the shark sequel did $3.2M at 3,400 locations. That’s a pretty good result for a sequel that stars a shark: The first Jason Statham movie brought in $4M in previews before churning out a $16.6M Friday, and $45.4M opening off what was a very campy, satirical marketing campaign. The $129M costing Meg 2 has a 50% stake from China’s CMC. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes loathe the sequel at 28% worse than the first movie back in 2018 at 45%. It’s a popcorn film for the masses, not for the tweeds.
Meanwhile, Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem saw its 2-day box office rise to $15M. Thursday was $4.87M at 3,513, -52% from Wednesday, with the Jeff Rowe-directed animated movie ranking third for the day.

Disney’s Haunted Mansion ranked fourth on Thursday with an estimated $1.6M at 3,740, -10% from Wednesday for a first week take of $33M. The previous Eddie Murphy 2003 movie opened on a Wednesday over Thanksgiving and its first seven days grossed $35.4M (unadjusted for inflation).
Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom booked at 3,411, did $1.47M yesterday, -6%, for a running four week total of $156.4M.
A24’s horror movie Talk to Me at 2,340 theaters did an estimated $1.2M yesterday for a first week of $15.8M. Granted, this title went wide versus A24’s Bodies Bodies Bodies last summer, which platformed, but it’s great to note that this Sundance acquisition has outstripped that Pete Davidson horror comedy’s total stateside cume of $11.4M. Talk to Me‘s first seven days are also 22% ahead of Midsommar‘s which stood at $13M and finaled at $27.4M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

With the summer movie season currently in full swing, this week’s update brings us through to August with the releases of Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
In addition, this week’s long range forecast offers a significant update on Warner Bros.’ Barbie, listed in the table below. Pre-sales for the highly anticipated adaptation continue to impress, leading The Little Mermaid by a significant margin and comparing favorably to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 at the same point prior to release.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount Pictures
August 2, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $27M-$36M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $37M-$49M
Domestic Total Range: $101M-$145M
PROS:
The Turtles brand has been successfully reinvented and reintroduced to modern youngsters a few times since its inception in the 1980s, most recently with the 2014 and 2016 live action box office hits. Nostalgia is also a factor here, as older fans are a key driver of interest in this new entry.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, with their production studio Point Grey Pictures, have a solid track record of box office success in recent years, with Good Boys, Sausage Party, and other films. The expectation here is that the creative team will execute a blend of modern and classic sensibilities with an eye towards ensuring the franchise’s endurance.
The absence of any other late summer animated options—or, for that matter, films catering to young males—puts this film in a strong position during the dog days of the season before school starts again. The use of an edgier animation style that embraces 2D and 3D to produce a comic book aesthetic, comparable to Sony’s Spider-Verse films, could further help Mutant Mayhem stand out with fans and young audiences.
CONS:
As seen with last summer’s DC League of Super-Pets, not all animated wide releases based on IP succeed at the box office. Turtles will need to stand out beyond its fan base and generate positive word of mouth to live up to its potential, especially in the wake of several aging franchises underperforming so far this summer.
Premium screen space could still be hard to come by, with other summer releases—like Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning—hoping to regain some of those auditoriums in their chase weeks.
If Disney’s Haunted Mansion breaks out, Turtles could have more competition than it hoped for.
Meg 2: The Trench
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 4, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $26M-$35M
Domestic Total Range: $70M-$105M
PROS:
The first Meg was a sleeper box office hit, opening to $45.4 million and legging out to $145.5 million domestically five summers ago.
The return of Jason Statham should assure the return of both his own fans and those who enjoyed the original.
Meg 2, like its predecessor, is well-positioned in the final weeks of summer movie season. An expected premium screen presence should also give it a boost.
CONS:
Competition could be notable this time around with the aforementioned appeal of Turtles to male audiences of varying ages, plus the potential staying power of other July releases. Titles such as Gran Turismo, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, Blue Beetle, and Strays will aim to get some of Meg 2‘s male moviegoers throughout August.
Historically, and particularly in recent memory, action sequels such as Meg 2 have not always lived up to their predecessors’ box office performances.

,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been a pretty consistent part of the pop culture landscape since Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s scrappy self-published comic became a sensation in the mid-1980s, spawning an iconic animated series and a popular toy line. In the years since, that initial spark of creativity has inspired several distinct animated universes, two live-action film series, a bevy of toys, multiple video games, mountains of comics, and at least one rock music tour.
With all of that in mind, we’re getting a brand new version of the plucky amphibian heroes in the form of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which looks to stoke the fires of 1980s nostalgia and introduce the Turtles to a new generation. If the previews released so far are anything to go by, the film appears to strike the right chords for older TMNT fans while also appealing to their children and – in some cases – grandchildren. Let’s head to the sewers and dredge up everything we know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
The Mutagen Strikes Again

Starting afresh – as opposed to continuing one of the existing film or TV continuities – the film sees the Turtles, after years of seclusion and training, making their way to the surface in the hopes of being embraced by humanity. Befriending April O’Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), the team takes on a reclusive crime syndicate to keep the streets and sewers safe. And, maybe, they’ll find the acceptance they crave along the way.
Some fans may notice the absence of certain details – notably the Foot Clan and the ever-present Turtles nemesis Shredder – but the presence of characters like Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena) suggests those TMNT staples will appear in due course. See also: Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who often appears in Turtles stories as a press-ganged scientist aiding the Foot in the creation of their own mutants. Although, just as often, he willingly helps as it furthers his own aims and research in mutation.
And, as it happens, other mutants will quickly become a cause of concern for the Turtles. Will they be friends or foes? Considering the film is subtitled Mutant Mayhem, expect that question to drive some of the action.

Naturally enough, the Turtles inhabit New York. But judging from our first glimpses at the film, it is a stylized New York one might expect Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Miles Morales to visit. Indeed, the art direction was one of the big appeals for long-time fans when a teaser first arrived in March. Distinct from previous iterations of the Turtles, it also feels like a natural path for the comic book-inspired film.
Beyond that, the swift introduction of alien worlds (and aliens) in the original Eastman and Laird comics and the first animated series means there is always room for the Turtles to visit locations less grounded than Manhattan.

Eschewing the typical pattern for the Turtles voice cast – or even long-time voice actors like Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, or Greg Cipes – the film will feature four actual teenagers in the lead roles. The Walking Dead: World Beyond‘s Nicolas Cantu leads as Leonardo, the most dedicated of Master Splinter’s pupils to their training and goals. Micah Abbey lends his voice to generally tech-smart Donatello. Brady Noon of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers brings the attitude as a new Raphael, while Shamon Brown Jr. parties it up as Michelangelo.
Of course, we’re assuming the personalities of the Turtles will remain intact in Mutant Mayhem, but as seen in the teaser trailer, casting a group of young men leads to a noticeably different interpretation of the characters – vocally, at least. Additionally, the group recorded their dialogue together, offering a chance for more improvisation and a greater sense of camaraderie, which we clearly see in the scene of the Turtles goofing off in the teaser.
Beyond the four leads, the film is outfitted with a surprising number of familiar names – many of them playing surprising character pulls from Turtles history. Starting with the most recognizable characters, The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri lends her voice to this version of April O’Neil. The character has had many permutations over the years, from TV anchor to budding reporter to straight-up ninja, so anything is possible with Edebiri and her take on the Turtles’ most constant friend. Jackie Chan takes on the role of Master Splinter, the boys’ sensei and adoptive father.

As mentioned above, the recognizable bad guys include Bebop and Rocksteady, voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena, respectively, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman. Will the latter end up a fly by the end of the film? Time will tell.
Paul Rudd offers his talents as Mondo Gecko, the radical skateboarding lizard who has been part of TMNT lore since 1989. Rose Byrne plays Leatherhead, a mutant alligator who has been both friend and foe to the Turtles over the years. Post Malone voices Ray Fillet, a character who first appeared in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series as “Man-Ray” but soon made his way to the action figure aisles under his subsequent moniker. Hannibal Buress becomes Genghis Frog, one of the original toy line’s attempts at beating imitators to the punch with a group known as the Punk Frogs. Natasia Demetriou takes on Wingnut, a humanoid bat who is sometimes an alien, a mutant, a would-be superhero, or a terrorist, depending on the era and series. Maya Rudolph is Cynthia Utrom – a character who might seem new for the film, but with a last name that fans will certainly recognize and that suggests something very specific about who she might truly be.

And finally, Ice Cube is Superfly, a new addition to the group of mutants to be featured in the film, who is revealed to be the primary villain in the latest trailer. Taking a page out of X-Men nemesis Magneto’s playbook, Superfly asserts that humans will never accept mutants like him and his cohorts, so he’s out to conquer mankind and put mutants in charge. Bebop, Rocksteady, and the others accordingly appear to be on his side.
While all the other mutants certainly pull at the nostalgia strings, the new direction in casting the Turtles voices may be the key thing that opens the characters up to a new generation of fans.

The film is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs The Machines – which he also wrote – and a staff writer on Gravity Falls and Disenchantment. Joining him as co-director is Kyler Spears, who also worked on Mitchells as a storyboard artist; considering their past collaboration, it’s no surprise that Mutant Mayhem feels like the next step in the evolution of the visual style we saw in Mitchells. Rowe also wrote Mutant Mayhem in conjunction with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit.
According to Rogen, part of the intent is to lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the title more heavily than in past iterations, citing movies like Stand By Me as inspiration. Based on the teaser, it definitely appears his intent made it to the finished product.
Rogen and Goldberg serve as producers with Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean as executive producers. Other crew include procution designer Yashar Kassai, character designer James A. Castillo, production supervisor Derek Manzella, and post-production supervisor Ryan Price.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opens on August 2, 2023. It’s unclear if the intent is to launch a new wave of TMNT movies, but if the film is a success, it’s likely that fans will have plenty more to be excited for in the future of the franchise.

2023-08-14 03:29:09+00:00,China Box Office: ‘Ninja Turtles’ Bombs as Local Blockbuster ‘No More Bets’ Hits Jackpot With $101M,"'No More Bets' is on track to earn over $500 million, making it China's biggest film of the summer.","Local crime thriller No More Bets dominated China’s box office during the Aug. 11-13 weekend, bringing in a boffo $101.1 million haul. The film enjoyed generous preview screenings ahead of its opening Wednesday and has earned an eye-popping $247.5 million already.
Meg 2: The Trench, the giant shark action sequel co-produced by Warner Bros. and China’s CMC Pictures, slipped to third place in its second weekend with $16.7 for the frame and $91 million overall. Chinese fantasy blockbuster Creation of the Gods 1: Kingdom of Storms climbed back into second place, taking in $26.8 million for a hefty $283.4 million four-weekend total, according to data from Artisan Gateway.
Paramount Pictures’ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, meanwhile, bombed with a three-day start of just under $1 million — despite the presence of Chinese action icon Jackie Chan in the starring voice cast. The flop continues a trend of Hollywood titles struggling to break through at China’s box office. Local ticketing service Maoyan projects Ninja Turtles to top out in China with just $1.5 million.
No More Bets is executive produced by Chinese hitmaker Ning Hao (Crazy Alien) and directed by relative newcomer Shen Ao. The film follows a computer programmer (Lay Zhang) and a model (Gina Jin) who are enticed abroad by the promise of high-paying jobs but find themselves duped by a ruthless gang and forced to participate in online fraud. Ao has said that he researched hundreds of cases of a real-life cyber fraud cases involving Chinese citizens as part of his writing process. Maoyan forecasts that No More Bets will finish its run with over $500 million, which will make it China’s biggest hit of the summer.
Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which got a surprise box-office boost from cosmopolitan young Chinese women, has begun winding down in the market. It has earned $35.8 million to date, with Maoyan forecasting only slight gains to come.
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer will be the next high-profile U.S. title to hit China when it opens Aug. 30.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW5vLW1vcmUtYmV0cy1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWJvbWJzLTEyMzU1NjU5NDMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utbm8tbW9yZS1iZXRzLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtYm9tYnMtMTIzNTU2NTk0My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

As usual, current forecast ranges for other upcoming films—such as Haunted Mansion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and Meg 2: The Trench—are below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfPs47Pud_A&ab_channel=MovieCoverage Blue Beetle Warner Bros.

This week’s update takes an early look at two releases slated for mid-August debuts, providing counter-programming options in the final weeks of summer movie season.
As usual, current forecast ranges for other upcoming films—such as Haunted Mansion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and Meg 2: The Trench—are below.
Blue Beetle
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 18, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $12M-$17M
Domestic Total Range: $27M-$55M
PROS:
The DC brand has a modest strength of its own, and Blue Beetle being an unfamiliar-to-the-masses character might make this film feel fresh among audiences.
Appeal to Latin American families could be notable, particularly with the back half of the summer and early fall seeing a relative lack of youth-friendly content hitting the big screen.
CONS:
With the comic book era not being the novelty it once was, audiences have become increasingly selective about which superhero films they spend money on in theaters. To that end, early tracking models for this title are trailing Shazam! Fury of the Gods by a fair margin.
Competition from mid-to-late summer family-friendly holdovers—like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Haunted Mansion—plus action films like Meg 2 and Gran Turismo, could diminish potential in the waning days of summer.
Strays
Universal Pictures
August 18, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $18M-$28M
Domestic Total Range: $45M-$80M
PROS:
A strong voice ensemble led by Jamie Foxx and Will Ferrell lends itself well to this R-rated comedy, hitting theaters in late summer—when films like Sausage Party and Good Boys have taken off at the box office in previous years.
Universal has a reputable history of turning adult-centric content into mid-range success, as in the case of the recent Cocaine Bear. Early social trends are also somewhat more encouraging than those of Violent Night at the same point before release.
CONS:
Depending on the severity of fictionalized animal abuse portrayed in the film, audience appeal and eventual reception is somewhat difficult to predict. A lean on male audiences is also expected.
On the subject of Cocaine Bear, Strays hasn’t quite reached the pre-release social metrics of that sleeper hit.

Ellen Cotter, the president and chief executive officer stated, “Driven by the stellar record setting opening of Barbie and Oppenheimer, our global box office revenues for the weekend of July 21, 2023 delivered","Reading International has announced that its global cinema circuit delivered revenues for the weekend of July 21st period that exceeded pre-pandemic periods.
Ellen Cotter, the president and chief executive officer stated, “Driven by the stellar record setting opening of Barbie and Oppenheimer, our global box office revenues for the weekend of July 21, 2023 delivered the best global weekend box office revenues since the opening of Avengers: Endgame in April 2019. The powerful marketing efforts of Warner Bros and Universal Studios, which resulted in the Barbenheimer double feature cultural phenomenon, drove the weekend box office revenues for the July 21st weekend, to exceed the corresponding weekend in July 2019, on a same store basis, by almost 60%. Each of our cinema divisions generated impressive percentage increases over the same weekend in 2019 – the United States 76%, Australia 50% and New Zealand 46%. We were thrilled that Saturday, July 22, and Sunday, July 23, represented the two highest box office revenue trading days in our Australian circuit’s history. And, we are confident that Barbenheimer will have legs. On Monday, July 24th, 2023, our U.S. cinema circuit generated the highest Monday box office revenues since Memorial Day in 2019.”
Cotter continued, sharing that “Barbenheimer also fueled our food & beverage revenues in the U.S. Our F&B Revenues on Saturday, July 22nd, were the highest daily amount since April 2019. Barbie set a record in the U.S. for the most money earned on a specific movie menu/merchandise combo. And, our Barbie themed cocktail, the ‘Beachy Keen,’ was our best selling cocktail over the weekend in the U.S., accounting for over 25% of all cocktail sales. The box office potential for the remainder of the 2023 summer looks promising. In addition to expecting long legs from Barbie and Oppenheimer, we are encouraged by the potential for Haunted Mansion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, The Meg 2 and Strays.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJveG9mZmljZXByby5jb20vYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLWdlbmVyYXRlcy1hdG9taWMtYm94LW9mZmljZS1mb3ItcmVhZGluZy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

As summer rolls to a close, this weekend will be one of the quietest we’ve had for some time, with the market leaning mostly on the strength of holdover business while Universal debuts The Last Voyage of the Demeter.
The Last Voyage of the Demeter
Universal Pictures
August 11, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $6M-$11M
PROS and CONS:
Barbie will extend its reign to four weekends atop the domestic box office as it comes off a $53 million third frame. The $1 billion-dollar global earner will also look to cross the $500 million domestic barrier before this weekend’s end as it chases the $574.2 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie, currently the top grosser of 2023.
After last weekend’s brief reprieve from the number two spot—Meg 2‘s debut pushed it down to third place—Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer should reclaim second place as it continues to display the kind of holding power typical of the filmmaker’s past releases. Even before its fourth frame is up, the pic is set to become the fourth of Nolan’s career to cross $250 million domestically after The Dark Knight, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem should begin settling into a leggy haul, with strong reviews (96 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (92 percent) carrying the franchise revival to a long family-driven runway.
Meg 2: The Trench currently boasts a 72 percent audience score, which would be a concern for most films… but not so much here, as the first Meg owns a far lower 43 percent. The sequel faces minimal competition from the weekend’s new opener and should continue to benefit from double-header screenings with Barbie at various drive-in locations.
Meanwhile, The Last Voyage of the Demeter may be fighting for a debut in the top five this weekend. Pre-sale trends are comparable to last August’s Beast and The Invitation. Tracking is strongest among men under 35, while its R rating and period setting offset other benefits offered by the Dracula-inspired narrative and appeal to horror fans.
Current projection ranges call for a 30% to 35% decrease from last weekend’s $172.9 million top ten aggregate.

2023-08-06 17:51:37+00:00,"More, Please: Four Films Grossed Over $28 Million, a Summer Weekend Box-Office First","""Sound of Freedom"" and ""The Meg 2"" also grossed over $28 million this weekend, but ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning"" is running out of time.","This weekend represented a summer box-office first: Four films grossed over $28 million. The last time that happened was Thanksgiving 2018, a year when domestic ticket sales hit $11.89 billion. “Barbie” (Warner Bros.) led for the third time with $53 million, down 43 percent. It now stands at $459 million domestic and over $1 billion worldwide, something has happened that defies all normal distribution logic.
The reason four films rarely gross this much in a single weekend is studios do everything they can to prevent it. They make sure to stagger new openings and avoid any competitive roadblocks. Yet audiences defied that logic as “Oppenheimer” (Universal), off only 39 percent, added another $28.7 million in its third week for $228 million domestic, $553 million worldwide.
Then add two new releases with “Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros.) at $30 million domestic and $112 million worldwide, and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount), $28 million, with an additional $8.5 million in 24 initial markets.
Based on Sunday’s estimates, the order between #2-#4 could change. “Turtles,” with its Wednesday domestic opening, grossed $15 million before the weekend. Had it opened Friday, much of that gross would have ended up in the three-day weekend and it would easily have been #1. (Its five-day domestic haul is $43 million).
It’s a victory for theaters when multiple titles don’t cannibalize grosses. The $178 million weekend total wasn’t a record August weekend (the same weekend in 2016 did $228 million, over $270 million adjusted, with “Suicide Squad” providing over half the gross). However, the unusually strong number suggests that success feeds momentum.
“Meg 2: The Trench” Courtesy Warner Bros.
It’s also a bit reassuring to see two franchise films with decent starts. The animated “Turtles” cost $70 million pre-marketing and should gross $100 million domestic or more. The original “Meg” grossed $530 million worldwide; this one has already collected $130 million. “Turtles” had an A Cinemascore, “Meg” B-, so expect the former to have better domestic legs.
With 29 days of the movie summer season remaining and $3.4 billion in grosses, we’ve exceeded the same period in 2023 and $4 billion remains possible. Year to date is around $6 billion (depending on whether you include non-film theater events). Year to date that’s up 23 percent, which would project to $9.1 million for the full year.
At #5, “Haunted Mansion” (Disney) fell 63 percent to just under $9 million. “Talk to Me” (A24) at #8 had an outstanding drop of only 40 percent for a horror film, adding $6.2 million. “Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” (Moviegoers) from India is a close #9 with over $1.5 million in only 270 theaters, off only nine percent.
Though it remains a disappointment, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) at #7 fell only 39 percent. It crossed $500 million worldwide, but it’s running out of time; in 2018, “Fallout” reached nearly $800 million. “Sound of Freedom” (Angel), down 43 percent, placed #6 to $163 million reported so far.

Ira Sachs’ unrated “Passages” (MUBI) (after the MPAA slapped on a dubious NC-17) debuted with a promising $64,000 in three New York/Los Angeles locations ($21,333 average). It adds another 12 cities next Friday, though its expansion might be slightly limited if some theaters exclude unrated films.
Elsewhere, specialized titles struggle. “Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics) out of Sundance this year managed only $316,000 in 404 theaters. Even worse was “Dreaming Wild” (Roadside Attractions), $129,000 in 402. “CatVideoFest 2023” fared better with $115,000 in only 41 theaters.
“Theater Camp” (Searchlight) nearly doubled its theaters, but managed only $570,000 in 555. It has reached $2.4 million, with an ultimate $4 million. The reported acquisition cost out of Sundance was $8 million.

Read on for the weekend box office report.
There was just no taking down Greta Gerwig‘s “Barbie,” starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, which brought in another estimated $93 million in its second weekend, down 43% from its opening weekend, astounding when you consider the larger second-weekend drops for most high-opening Marvel movies. Going by estimates, “Barbie” has made $351.4 million through Sunday, putting it on track to pass “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” for biggest movie of the summer sometime this coming week. “Barbie” is officially the fastest movie of the year to hit $300 million, and it should cross $400 million any day now. “Barbie” added another $122.2 million overseas this weekend to bring its global total to $774.5 million in just two weeks in 70 total markets. A billion worldwide is now inevitable.

Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” grossed an estimated $46.2 million in 3,647 locations, down just 44% from its opening weekend. Its domestic gross is at $174 million, and should be catching up to “Dunkirk” and “Interstellar” in the next few days. Internationally, it made another $72.4 million, bringing its overseas total to $226.3 million and global total just past $400 million. $24 million of its global total came from IMAX screens in its second weekend, convincing Universal to extend its IMAX run through August 17.
Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” directed by Justin Simien, came into the weekend with horrid reviews but with a release into 3,740 theaters and a cast that includes two Oscar winners (Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto) and Oscar nominee, Lakeith Stanfield, as well as Rosario Dawson, Tiffany Haddish, Danny De Vito, Owen Wilson, and more. After making just under $10 million on Friday (including $3.1 million from earlier previews), “Haunted Mansion” opened with an estimated $24.2 million to take third place. It also received a “B+” from audiences via CinemaScore, not great for what should be a fairly populist release.
Angel Studios’ massive hit, “Sound of Freedom,” made another $12.4 million in 3,411 – it just keeps adding theaters despite being in its fourth weekend – to take fourth place. Although that was down 37%, it has already made $149 million domestically so far, which is more than quite a few studio blockbusters, including a couple below.

For instance, Tom Cruise‘s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” hasn’t made that much in North America, adding another $10.7 million this weekend for fifth place, down 45% in its third weekend with $139.2 million grossed domestically. It’s going to lose a lot more theaters on Wednesday and Thursday to make room for new movies.
The Philippou Brothers‘ Australian horror flick, “Talk to Me,” starring Sophie Wilde, came into the weekend with terrific reviews, going back to its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. A24 released it into 2,340 locations where it brought in $4.2 million on Friday, with $1.2 million from earlier previews. It is estimated to have made $10 million in its first weekend, almost twice as much as tracking and projections while averaging $4,274 per theater. It’s a great start for a movie that has a couple weekends without any horror competition, but it’s also better than so many other recent A24 genre releases, including ones from the likes of Ari Aster, Alex Garland, and David Lowery. Like “Haunted Mansion,” it received a “B+” CinemaScore from audiences, which is decent for horror, and shows that word-of-mouth could be strong.
Harrison Ford‘s return for “Indiana Jones and the Dice of Destiny” dropped to seventh place with $4 million (down 40%) with $167 million grossed domestically. Disney-Pixar’s followed in eighth with $3.4 million and $134.8 million domestic. Disney’s summer began much better with Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3” and “The Little Mermaid” in May and has just tailed off ever since.

“Insidious: The Red Door” has become the biggest installment of the franchise with $174.3 million grossed worldwide, $78 million of that came from North America where it made another $3.2 million this weekend to take ninth place.
GKIDS released Takehiko Inoue’s anime feature, “The First Slam Dunk,” a huge blockbuster hit in Papan into 581 North American locations where it brought in $626,000, averaging $1,077 per location. It looks like we might have to wait a little longer for another anime hit.
Most players had “Barbenheimer” in first and second place again in the box office prediction game, with “Haunted Mansion” in third. Fourth place was generally split between “Sound of Freedom” and “Mission: Impossible,” same with fifth place, but there’s a very good chance we’ll get quite a few perfect 6 out of 6s this week.
Five players went five for five in the July 21 game, but if you guessed that board leader “Mellow Drama” had the highest point score with 95,100, then you’d be correct.
On Wednesday, Paramount opens “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” joined on Friday by Jason Statham in “Meg 2: The Trench.” Can either of them beat “Barbie”? Tune into the weekend preview on Wednesday to find out what I think.

2023-07-16 16:10:00+00:00,Why ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Got a Makeover With Brand New CG Animation Style,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ offers a new look at the iconic turtle heroes thanks to CG animation.,"We’ve never been really far away from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Since they first arrived as comic book characters in the early 1980s, there has been a steady supply of comics, TV shows, games and films that celebrate the canon of Cowabunga. And TMNT fandom, once experienced, can almost never be forgotten. Is it the masks? The pizza? The ooze that made them who they are? It’s nearly impossible to single one thing out.
When lifelong Turtle enthusiasts Seth Rogen, Jeff Rowe and Evan Goldberg started working on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which arrives in theaters this August, they knew they wanted to update the characters for a new generation while also telling a relevant story. They were also interested in using a CG animation style that looked less than perfect and would remind audiences of their own doodles they might have done in a notebook while listening to a boring class lecture in high school.
“I think for us, artistically, it was a reaction to a 30-year trend in 3D CG animation to push towards photorealism and hyper-realistic lighting and texturing,” says writer-director Rowe, who also co-directed “The Mitchells vs. the Machines.” “Then, a few years ago, ‘(Spider-Man:) Into the Spider-Verse’ happened, and that showed that a movie can look like the concept artwork and can be critically and financially successful. That opened a lot of doors and I think we tried to take that football and run with it on ‘Mitchells,’ and then on ‘Turtles,’ I tried to be even less compromising. We decided we wanted this movie to look exactly like a concept artwork, and we want the concept artwork to feel distinctly human and not computer-generated. And that means sketchy and imperfect and misshapen and reminiscent of the way you draw when you’re a child or a teenager, and your passion and enthusiasm for making art hasn’t been dimmed by formal art training. It’s the kind of drawing you do before you have that voice in your head that says, ‘Don’t do that. That’s not how you draw.’ We wanted to design a film that had that level of unfettered expression. And then it was just a lot of designing it and convincing a lot of really talented artists that it was OK to make mistakes, and that those were actually features not bugs.”
Production designer Yashar Kassai found working out the sketchy, unfinished style one of the most difficult parts of the production as well.
“The thing that felt so wrong in the beginning was telling my very highly trained, skillful artists who are also ultra-talented that, because we’re drawing like teenagers, I need you to draw that again but I need you to peel away all those years you spent in art school learning your craft and draw like your 15-year-old self,” says Kassai. “But once everyone relinquished the conventional design wisdom of animation, we had a lot of fun.”
This emotionally authentic style of animation fell in line with the story they wanted to tell with TMNT — a coming-of-age origin story about teenagers who experience feelings of isolation, loneliness and awkwardness as they try to find themselves. Plus, they’re mutants and turtles.
During Rowe’s first meetings Rogen and Goldberg, they talked about bringing tears to the eyes of viewers “when they leave this movie. “Being a teenager is inherently an emotional, confusing, lonely time in your life. There’s so much feeling in making these characters real teenagers and we committed to having them voiced by teenagers.”
The voice cast includes Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Micah Abbey as Donatello and Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo. In the non-teenager roles, an equally notable group of actors appear: Rogen voices a mutant animal named Bebop, Jackie Chan is Master Splinter, John Cena is Rocksteady, Ice Cube plays the villainous Superfly and Maya Rudolph is the mysterious Cynthia Utrom.
The over-21 cast also voices mutants. And those mutants are some of the most unusual and bizarre you might see in a mainstream animation feature.
“Our Holy Grail of the entire franchise has always been the late ’80s cartoon, the original series, and that really wacky toy line that came out during the early ’90s,” says Kassai. “We were looking back to the time when sophomoric gross-out humor was the comedic style of the day. So we started there, but then we added the teenage drawing aspect on top of it as a very strong top layer. We were also heavily inspired by films like ‘Chungking Express.’ The Turtles are hiding from humans so it all takes place at night, and these kids have to hide in the shadows because they want to be a part of human society but they feel kind of unsafe when they’re around humans because of what their dad has told them about humans. So they cannot be like on a sunlit beach or on a sunny day in, like, Central Park. We spent a lot of time diversifying what New York at nighttime looks like and giving it a variety of different color schemes.”
For Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation and Paramount Animation, it was important to find the right creative team to take on TMNT. This team would be working with one of the most beloved animation franchises and reaching out to a new generation of potential fans who may have not even been born when the first TV shows and films were created.
“I think it’s an animation masterpiece and just hilarious and Seth and his team are such a big part of that,” says Naito. “It’s a good example of creators coming in to reimagine something that they love. I remember coming back to Nickelodeon and talking about TMNT and we knew the team who worked on it had to be creators who loved TMNT.”
Brian Robbins, president and CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, “and I both thought about Seth Rogen, and when we called him about it he loved it, he grew up with the characters. From there, we brought in Jeff Rowe, who also grew up with the Turtles and it was his dream for him to come and work on Turtles and to work with Seth. I think that love is really seen on the screen.”
For Goldberg, the appeal started early and never waned. He hopes their take on the characters will be relatable through their real, universal struggles.
“They are mutants, they are ninjas, and they are awesome-looking,” says Goldberg. “Overall, though, it is a story about a father and his four brothers who are very different, argue and disagree, but they are a family who are always there for each other. They are doing what they can to make the world a better place and that is what we should be doing. No matter your race, religion, or what type of mutated human-animal hybrid you are, you should be there for your family and do what you can to make the world rad. In a way, we are all Turtles, metaphorically speaking.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZvY3VzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1hbmltYXRpb24tMTIzNTY2NjU0MS_SAWhodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9mb2N1cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tYW5pbWF0aW9uLTEyMzU2NjY1NDEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-31 14:00:15+00:00,August 2023 box office preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ kicks off last month of summer,"August is often referred to as the ""Dog Days of Summer,"" because at a certain point, the box office just dies.","August is often referred to as the “Dog Days of Summer,” and it’s not just because of the intense heat that is permeating the country, but also because at a certain point, the box office just dies, as people go on vacation and others prepare to return to school in September.
This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.
Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)
The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.
“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)
A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)
Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.
“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)
Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.
“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)
A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”
“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)
Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.
“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)
Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.
“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)
Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.
“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)
Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?
“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)
Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.
“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)
Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.

Time to get into some limited releases …
“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)
The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.
“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)
Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.
“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)
Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.
“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)
Another popular horror film from this year’s Sundance is Laura Moss’ twist on Frankenstein with the underrated Marin Ireland playing a morgue technician trying to reanimate her little girl using materials from a pregnant woman (Judy Reyes).
“The Adults” (Variance – Aug. 18)
Michael Cera, Sophia Lillis (“Stranger Things,” “Enola Holmes”) and Hannah Gross star in the latest indie dramedy from Dustin Guy Defa (“Person to Person”), playing siblings dealing with the death of their mother. It premiered at Berlin earlier this year, then played Tribeca Festival.
“Bottoms” (United Artists – Aug. 25)
At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.
“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)
This stop-motion animated film written and directed by Jim Capobianco follows the life of Leonardo da Vinci with a voice cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Daisy Ridley, Stephen Fry and Matt Berry. (This is also getting a moderate release in a very busy late August weekend.)
“Scrapper” (Kino Lorber – Aug. 25)
Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) plays the absent father of a child (Lola Campbell) who decides to live on her own after her mother dies in this feature directorial debut from Charlotte Regan.
That’s it for this month. September will be all about the festivals and the official start of Oscar season as the box office tends to slow down even more.

2023-07-27 18:46:46+00:00,"Long Range Box Office Forecast: Can NINJA TURTLES, MEG 2, GRAN TURISMO, BLUE BEETLE, and STRAYS Carry August?",This week's report takes a quick look at how August's key releases are shaping up so far as there is no wide release addition to the forecast for the weekend of August 25.,"With no new wide releases coming to theaters for the weekend of August 25, this week’s report takes a look at how the month’s key releases are shaping up.
PROS:
With the sustained holdover success of July releases Barbie and Oppenheimer, August looks poised to be a healthy month overall.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (August 2, Paramount) continues to track well as a late summer animated offering that will appeal to young and older fans alike. Pre-sale trends are well ahead of Elemental and not far behind those of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.
Meg 2: The Trench (August 4, Warner Bros.) provides a late summer, PG-13 action-horror-comedy hybrid for audiences looking to end the summer on a lighter note after the longer, more dramatic genre films that have come earlier. Blue Beetle (August 18, Warner Bros.) hopes to ride the same wave among DC comic fans and Latin American families, while Strays (August 18, Universal) aims for the older audiences on the comedy spectrum.
CONS:
As Barbie and Oppenheimer settle in for leggy runs that could see both films rank highly on the box office chart moving into early fall, their success is likely to overshadow some upcoming releases—especially if the ongoing WGA and SAG/AFTRA prevents studios from marketing those newer films as much as they otherwise would have.
Meg 2‘s marketing campaign has left something to be desired, and early pre-sales reflect a lower initial burst of enthusiasm than seen for its 2018 predecessor. It’s likely to be the most impacted by the current Barbenheimer craze.
Gran Turismo (August 11, Sony) remains a wild card as it hopes to build beyond its core video game fan base. Pre-sales are relatively slow out of the gate.
Blue Beetle and The Last Voyage of the Demeter (August 11, Universal) continue to trend very modestly as marketing begins to ramp up. Strays remains a volatile film to forecast due to reasons mentioned in prior reports.
The final weekend of August is currently without a major studio title, meaning holdovers will have to carry the market before The Equalizer 3 (September 1, Sony) opens for Labor Day weekend.

2023-07-13 16:10:46+00:00,Seth Rogen Goes Inside the Animation of ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’,"Seth Rogen and Ice Cube appear in a new featurette about upcoming animated movie 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle: Mutant Mayhem,' which opens Aug.","Cowabunga! Seth Rogen is among the creatives showing off the unique animation style for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle: Mutant Mayhem, which Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies will open on Aug. 4.
“The bigger swing these animated movies are taking, the more excited people seem to be like that,” says Rogen in a new featurette.
In the story, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
“They had to feel like real teenagers,” says writer/director Jeff Rowe of the pizza-loving Turtles, which extended to creating a visual style as if it were animated by teens.
“What we wanted to do was create an incredibly fun and engaging version of the Ninja Turtles,” says Rogen, a producer, writer and the voice of Bebop.
Ice Cube, who voices Superfly adds that “the animation and flavor of the movie was so original and fresh.”
The voice cast also includes Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown, Jr., Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Nicolas Cantu, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Brady Noon, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tYW5pbWF0aW9uLTEyMzU1MzQ4NjEv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1hbmltYXRpb24tMTIzNTUzNDg2MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-17 19:04:23+00:00,The Surprise Winners From Hollywood’s Summer of Toys,"The toy market is seeing unexpected trends following the release of ‘Barbie,’ ‘Transformers’ and other titles.","Marl Davidson has been selling vintage Barbie dolls for more than 30 years, and business has always been strong — with one notable exception. Allan, released in 1964 as Ken’s best friend, was so unpopular that he was discontinued two years later before resurfacing in the 1990s. For years, Davidson had zero luck interesting buyers in Allan — that is, until Warner Bros.’ smash summer hit Barbie, featuring Michael Cera as the awkward, colorfully attired sidekick. “Allan is [usually] hard to sell,” she tells The Hollywood Reporter. “You can’t get rid of Allan, seriously. But now you can’t have enough Allans. Allan came out the winner.”
This forgotten doll turned success story hasn’t been the only standout surprise during this summer of toys. As Hollywood’s emphasis on established IP has led to film franchises based around characters that originated as dolls, comic book characters and action figures (like Ninja Turtles or Lego Indiana Jones), 2023 has delivered unexpected results for retailers. Barbie, based on the Mattel doll that launched in 1959, leads the way for recent toy-centric titles — and the season’s theatrical features in general, having topped $1.1 billion globally. And Paramount Consumer Products touts 400 licensees for its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem film and 1,100 total for the franchise.
The boost is much needed after U.S. retail toy sales in 2022 slipped 0.2 percent from the previous year, according to research firm NPD Group, following a notable rise during the pandemic as families craved at-home entertainment. And toy retailers are grateful: Davidson sold a firstedition Barbie doll from the 1959 line last month for $20,000, and a collection on consignment went for $600,000. Additionally, eBay vp global collectibles Gene Cook tells THR that site users worldwide searched for Barbie more than 14,000 times an hour in the week before and after the film’s release, with Allan searches up 1,300 percent.
Other surprises linked to Barbie include the increased interest in Ken, whose portrayal by Ryan Gosling has been a fan favorite. “Ken has been outselling Barbie [because of the film], which is pretty interesting to us,” admits Don Kipper, owner of L.A.’s oldest toy store, Kip’s Toyland, who notes that Barbie sales in general have been up dramatically thanks to the movie. “Barbie has been a staple, of course, for many years since the late ’50s. But Ken has not, and Ken has surpassed her after the movie.”
Today, the latest development is the “Kiddult” trend, with toys not only going to children but also to teens and adults. “We are seeing adults who haven’t bought a toy in a long time; they may buy one because they are gravitating toward the Barbie movie,” notes Adrienne Appell, executive vp marketing communications at The Toy Association. Hasbro, which launched Transformers toys in 1984 and has seen them remain a top performer, reports that the line’s sales have increased 85 percent since the latest film’s debut in June. “The characters that are featured in the films usually rise to the top — along with some of the ones that are classic, beloved characters like Bumblebee and Optimus Prime,” says Tom Warner, Hasbro G.M. and senior vp global action brands. “It just halos the entire brand at the time.”
Even more than for toys, the comic book market correlates quite closely to the success (or failure) of a film or TV show. This summer, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse solidified Miles Morales as perhaps the most valuable character created this century. Before the 2018 original Spider-Verse movie, a collector could pick up a mint copy of Miles’ first comic book appearance (2011’s Ultimate Fallout No. 4) for less than $50. By the time Across the Spider-Verse arrived in June, it became a $2,000 book (it has since leveled out to about $1,600), per CovrPrice, which tracks comic book sales across the internet.
The new film also has propelled Spider-Man 2099 to new heights. Miguel O’Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), was a largely overlooked ‘90s character whose first appearance (1992’s Spider-Man 2099 No. 1) was a bargain bin issue and is now selling for around $200 in the 9.8 grade, per CovrPrice.
Just as much a part of the narrative of this summer’s releases are the surprising misses, such as a recent rough stretch for DC Studios titles that include the audience rejection of the Ezra Miller-starring The Flash, which collected just $268 million at the global box office against a $200 million budget before marketing, impacting toy sales for the project. “When you look at the Flash toys, the character from the movie that outsold everything else was Batman and the Batmobile,” says Jordan Hembrough, founder of the toy retail site Hollywood Heroes. “And it’s because people have this connection to Michael Keaton and his portrayal of the 1989 Batman.”
The same is true on the comic book side in terms of value of classic comics. “Flash books are down. Anything related to this film is kind of dropping,” says CovrPrice co-founder Matt Devoe, noting that part of what drives collectability is the promise of what comes next. (See: Marvel’s post-credit scenes). “The Flash film didn’t have anything for fans to take and speculate on. In fact, it’s led to a lot of confusion of, ‘OK, what is DC doing with their future lineup?’”

The domestic movie audiences are relishing iconic Ninja Turtle siblings, four mutant creatures who are skilled martial artists, being ""raised"" and ""trained"" by action hero Jackie Chan in their new animated offering, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
As one of the latest Hollywood movies to be released during China's fiercely competitive summer season, the film debuted on Friday and is currently holding seventh position in the box-office charts.

Chan, one of the most celebrated Chinese stars in the West, lends his voice to Master Splinter, a mutant rat who becomes the adoptive father of the four anthropomorphic turtles: Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Splinter guides the turtles in their martial arts training, drawing inspiration from Hong Kong action films, as they watch and learn from various scenarios.
Set in New York, the movie portrays the coming-of-age journey of the young turtle brothers. They develop a fondness for human customs, such as indulging in pizzas and enjoying outdoor movies.

Brilliant decision to have the Turtles voiced by actual teenagers - it adds so much to the film tonally, but also the humor pops more.

2023-07-26 22:44:41+00:00,"Paramount Animation To Move Away From Original Animated Features, Focus On Nick IP","""We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,"" says Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins.","In a wide-ranging profile published in Variety, Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins revealed new details about how he’s going to fix the company’s moribund Paramount Animation division.
The timing is opportune: Paramount is about to release Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which will almost certainly become the most successful release ever from Paramount Animation.
Not that “most successful Paramount Animation film” is a prestigious competition. Since launching in 2011, the division has produced a handful of dreary projects that are remarkably consistent in their vapidness (Wonder Park, Sherlock Gnomes, Rumble, Monster Trucks), and a couple reasonably successful Spongebob features.
In any case, Robbins appears ready to soak in the glory of TMNT. “It’s not about Disney and Pixar anymore,” he told Variety, citing recent stumbles like Disney-Pixar’s Elemental. Forget the fact that Robbins would kill for an animated stumble like Elemental, which is on its way to $400 million global, far more than any Paramount Animation-produced animated feature has ever grossed.
If it’s not about Disney and Pixar anymore, what is it about then? According to Robbins, he has discovered that “people are looking for animated movies that are irreverent and have a comedic point of view.” It’s a lucky break that he figured this out before any other U.S. animation producer realizes that comedy and irreverence work well in animation.
Robbins’s second big insight is that original animation isn’t worth the investment. “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,” he said. Forgoing the produce-and-pray approach, Robbins has decided it would simply be easier to eliminate all traces of originality from the studio’s feature pipeline. He reveals that Under the Boardwalk, a formerly theatrical release, is now being quietly shuffled over to Paramount+, while it had previously been announced that Ron Howard’s The Shrinking of Treehorn had been sold to Netflix.
In place of original concepts, Robbins is turning Paramount Animation into a clearinghouse for Nickelodeon IP. First up, the aforementioned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. The company announced today that it is also developing a sequel to TMNT as well as a Paramount+ spinoff series, titled Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
The studio is also working on more Spongebob universe features including Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie (Netflix, 2024) and a series of Avatar: The Last Airbender films. A new Paw Patrol movie will also release this year.
It’s worth noting here that none of Nick’s IP magically appeared out of thin air, as Robbins seems to believe. All of them were original concepts at one point in their history, and they were developed by artists over a period of years. Before they became familiar IP, some animation studio needed to invest in the original idea. Best of luck to Robbins and his all-in-on-Nick strategy. It’s going to look like a brilliant decision in early August after TMNT is released. But I’m guessing a few years from now, he’s going to come to the realization that abandoning original ideas is neither a viable nor smart long-term strategy for any feature animation division.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJ0b29uYnJldy5jb20vZXhlY3V0aXZlcy9wYXJhbW91bnQtYW5pbWF0aW9uLXRvLW1vdmUtYXdheS1mcm9tLW9yaWdpbmFsLWFuaW1hdGVkLWZlYXR1cmVzLWZvY3VzLW9uLW5pY2staXAtMjMwODkwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-31 15:01:18+00:00,"'TMNT' Co-Creator Confirms Disappointing News for ""Last Ronin"" Fans - Inside the Magic","It might be a great week for 'TMNT' fans, but this is bad news.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will likely take theaters by storm over the next few weeks. This year has seen its fair share of blockbusters take a massive slice out of the box office, including Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023). However, it’s animated films that seem to be the dominant force of cinema in 2023.
Across the Spider-Verse (2023) caught $682.4 million on its web and became Sony Pictures Animation’s highest-grossing film, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.355 billion worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing animated films ever.
Needless to say, the CG-animated Mutant Mayhem stands a solid chance at success. The film is also being heavily marketed in a similar fashion to Barbie (minus all the many shades of pink, of course), which echoes “Turtle-Mania” from the early ’90s.
In fact, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures are so confident Mutant Mayhem will turn in a huge profit that they’ve already announced the film is the first installment in a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set to follow the movie on Paramount+ this year.
So it makes sense that Nickelodeon isn’t letting anything stand in the film’s way — not even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
It turns out Nickelodeon is king when it comes to the TMNT property, so much so that they appear to have already stopped another Ninja Turtles reboot from hitting the big screen, likely because it may interfere with the new Mutant Mayhem universe.
That reboot is “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020)…
What is “The Last Ronin”?
“The Last Ronin” is an ongoing comic book series from IDW Publishing, which has been churning out TMNT comic books since 2011. The series follows lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo as he embarks on a one-way revenge mission to take on the man responsible for the deaths of his three brothers in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City.
The series now also has a follow-up titled “Lost Years,” which details the preceding years in which Michelangelo embarks on a quest to become the Last Ronin while, in the present day, introducing four brand-new Ninja Turtles, Odyn, Yin, Moja, and Uno, who are under the tutelage of newly-appointed sensei, Casey Marie Jones.
At this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that “The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution” (2023) will arrive later this year.

Is “The Last Ronin” in a different universe?
“The Last Ronin” takes place in an alternate timeline now dubbed the “Ronin-verse.” However, it’s reasonable to consider that it follows on from the “present-day” IDW material, which is still ongoing.
The Ronin-verse is already expanding in the form of follow-ups such as “Lost Years,” the one-shot comic “Lost Day,” and the upcoming “Re-Evolution,” and also with many collectible action figures. There’s also a “Triple-A” video game in the works, although most fans would prefer a theatrical adaptation.

Will there be a “Last Ronin” movie?
Since it arrived in 2020, TMNT fans have been clamoring for a big-screen adaptation of “The Last Ronin.” In fact, fans have wanted a dark, gritty theatrical outing for well over three years. After all, this is the style and tone in which the Ninja Turtles first started in Mirage Comics, co-created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984.
Unfortunately, it looks like “The Last Ronin” won’t be getting the big screen treatment, or the small screen treatment for that matter — at least not anytime soon.
In an interview with ComicBook.com, Kevin Eastman discussed the fact fans have been hoping for a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” but explained that Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route instead.
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
While Nickelodeon could easily adopt DC’s “Elseworlds” strategy, which isolates films such as Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) from its shared universe installments, it looks like the universe established in Mutant Mayhem is their number one priority.
This may come as very disappointing news for fans of “The Last Ronin,” but there is a short, CG-animated, fan-made film on YouTube worth checking out. And then, of course, there’s the upcoming video game based on the ongoing comic book series.

When is “The Last Ronin” game out?
There’s currently no release date for “The Last Ronin” video game, though we do know it is inspired by the popular God of War video game series.
Earlier this year, Doug Rosen, Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said the game would focus only on Michelangelo. However, he added that Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, who only appear in the comics through hallucinations and flashbacks, may also appear in a playable format in flashback sequences.
Rosen also said that the mature themes of The Last Ronin (TBA) would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be.”

‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’
As we told you, the launch of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reps a big win for the Brian Robbins-led Paramount Pictures Studios, as he builds out and breathes new lives into franchises.
Since 2012 and not including 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles global merchandise sales have amassed $8 billion, per industry sources. This was accomplished during Paramount’s ownership of the TMNT IP that they it acquired in 2009.
Paramount transitioned the Turtles business from predominantly collectors to mass retail, and natch, the latest reboot has catapulted demand from TMNT fans and partners alike. In the U.S. and Canada alone, industry projections think Mutant Mayhem, a co-production with Nickelodeon and Seth Rogen’s Point Grey, could exceed $110M.
Paramount Consumer Products’ Turtles theatrical program was its most ambitious yet, counting north of 400 licensees for the film and 1,100 total for the franchise.
Among those platinum licensees with Turtles merchandise tied to Mutant Mayhem were Playmates, Hasbro, Mattel, Crayola, Funko, Crocs, General Mills and more. Their products hit the global store shelves of Walmart, Target, Amazon, Macy’s, Kroger, Kohl’s, Primark, Smyths, The Entertainer, Soriana, Big W, Iden, Toys R Us, Mercado Libre and others.
In addition to action figures, the Mutant Mayhem product range also included Build-a-Bear.
In sum, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles products are available in more than 550 retailers, totaling 40,000 retail doors, in more than 220 markets worldwide.
Gaming integrations for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles included Minecraft, The Sims FreePlay, Fruit Ninja, Match Masters and more. Publishing partnerships included Random House, Bendon and IDW. There was a launch of TMNT: Battle Tycoon on Roblox from ParaG Game Division in partnership with Gamefam.
Paramount Global delivered over a half-billion impressions for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles across domestic CBS, adult networks and social. TMNT marathons aired across domestic Nick channels in addition there were marketing and activations across all foreign platforms. A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles YouTube channel was launched, and now counts 2.66M subscribers. Paramount’s PlutoTV showcased iterations of the TMNT 2012, 2019 and 1987 series.
Turtle Power at San Diego Comic-Con
Eastman announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Paramount and Nick secured full rights to air the original cartoon series from the 1980s. Speaking of Comic-Con, Paramount was the only studio to have the guts to take a film down to Hall H and strut out footage for fans with director Jeff Rowe. Such a promotional opportunity was lost by rival motion picture studios, who shied away from the fanboy confab during the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes with a majority of talent unavailable to promote. Still, 135,000 attendees showed up at SDCC.
Meanwhile, the Paramount+ streaming service featured the full collection of TMNT with four series and eight movies in the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia, Latin America, Brazil, Italy and South Korea among others. There was more vertical integration power across the Viacom empire for Mutant Mayhem with the pic’s promotion at Nickelodeon resorts and attractions around the world in the U.S., UK and Italy.
Separately, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem counted a promotional partner campaign worth north of $100M in media value from myriad brand partners drawing 3 billion impressions, robust for an animated movie. And that’s without a big automobile advertiser. Earlier this summer, Disney/Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, a live-action title, counted a $118M promo partner campaign.
Among the notable brand partners for Mutant Mayhem were Pizza Hut. The team-up involved animators authentically integrating Pizza Hut into the movie. Pizza Hut also blasted off a 360-degree TMNT campaign by bringing back the fan favorite Big New Yorker pizza and supported that limited-time menu with activations across linear and digital platforms within the Paramount portfolio. There were four media spots including a 30-second custom animated spot. In addition, there were custom pizza boxes featuring an AR mobile gaming experience. There were also TMNT co-branded Pizza Vans that passed out pizza to fans at San Diego Comic-Con and other high-profile events across the country. Twenty-two international markets featured bespoke local spots, advertising, delivery stunts and limited-edition pizzas inspired by the movie, like the Mutagen Pizza in Australia.
The Xbox global campaign counted the first time-ever innovation of pizza-scented video game controllers with custom designs featuring each of the pic’s four heroes in a half-shell. Influencers led a campaign for a “retweet and win sweepstakes” that went viral across the web. In addition, Xbox executed a TMNT fan event at its NYC Microsoft flagship store on 5th Avenue on the pic’s opening day which included movie content via storefront billboards and a TMNT-themed gaming lounge with controllers on display. There was also a collaboration between TMNT and Pizza Hut for an apparel collection available at Primark.
Turtles eat bugs, hence P&G’s Zevo flying insect traps proved an ideal partner. It was the product’s first film partnership ever. The campaign featured a fully integrated 30-second spot that aired across linear and digital media platforms.
Among the local international highlights was Old El Paso’s “Ninja-Proof Tortilla Pockets” in the UK and France, which saw 1.2 million themed packs in 20,000 major supermarket locations and on Amazon.
Brazil’s Gol Airlines let fans “Fly In Mutant Time” onboard a fully customized Mutant Mayhem plane. The stunt was promoted in major airports, print and online.
Chargespot, the largest charging station brand in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan, called on teens and young adults to “Get Charged” at 27,000 customized charging stations.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem grossed $15.2M this past weekend at the domestic box office, repping a nice -45% ease for a 12-day running total of $72.3M. Through seven movies, the TMNT franchise has grossed over $1.2 billion at the worldwide box office.

2023-08-12 11:00:33+00:00,R-Rated 'TMNT' Installment Gets First Official Trailer - Inside the Magic,The first official trailer for the R-rated 'TMNT' installment is here.,"We finally have a trailer for the R-rated TMNT installment…
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) has put TMNT back on the map. While the franchise’s popularity hasn’t waned much since its heyday in the early ’90s, the franchise hasn’t seen this much success on the silver screen since the original 1990 live-action film became the most successful independent film of all time (for nine years).
The latest reboot is impressing audiences and critics, and has taken a big slice out of the box office. For many fans, though, Mutant Mayhem is bittersweet. It’s no mystery that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a darker side, which is how it started in the original Mirage Studios comics in 1984, a trend that has continued through all the various publishers.

IDW Publishing currently holds the rights to TMNT in comics, and it’s been churning out volumes since 2011. But in more recent years, the focus has been on the R-rated TMNT comic book series, “The Last Ronin” (2020), a gritty tale set in a futuristic New York City, in which lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo is on a mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and father, Master Splinter.
The comic book was such a huge success that it shot to the top of The New York Times bestsellers list. This year, we got a follow-up series titled “The Last Ronin — Lost Years” (2023), and a third series was recently announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans have fallen in love with “The Last Ronin” so much they’ve been crying out for a big-screen adaptation since it arrived.
Related: Upcoming R-Rated ‘TMNT’ Installment Could Anger Same Fans Already Hating ‘Mutant Mayhem’
Recently, the Facebook fan page Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.com shared a status calling for Christopher Nolan to direct The Last Ronin movie. There’s even an impressive fan film on YouTube based on “The Last Ronin” from “Speedokaggen.”
Unfortunately, though, The Last Ronin movie is unlikely to happen, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman has confirmed that such a project isn’t on the cards. In a recent interview with ComicBook.com, he explained how Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route for “The Last Ronin” instead.
Here are his full comments from the interview:
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
It comes as no surprise that Nickelodeon is choosing to focus on the more family-friendly side of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the big screen and the small screen, rather than “The Last Ronin”, whose latest issue (“Lost Years” Issue #5) contains R-rated violence. After all, it’s the more universal appeal that has made the franchise incredibly lucrative since the original cartoon series in 1987. Recently, it was confirmed that Mutant Mayhem is being developed into a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set for Paramount+ later this year.

Fortunately, though, we are getting The Last Ronin video game, which was announced earlier this year. While very little is known about it, other than the fact it’s an adaptation of the comic books, it has been likened to the popular God of War series.
But now, we finally have our first trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin (TBA), which publisher THQ Nordic revealed during August 2023’s digital event showcase.
The Last Ronin Trailer
Check out the brand-new trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin below, as per the official PlayStation YouTube channel:
While we don’t see any cutscene or gameplay footage, we are teased with the deaths of Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello. It’s not much, but it’s something, and it will have fans of “The Last Ronin” comic books salivating for more.
The Last Ronin Synopsis
The Last Ronin video game is an adaptation of the comic book series. While “The Last Ronin” comic books are ongoing, with a third series starting in December, Doug Rosen, the Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said earlier this year that the game would focus only on Michelangelo. There was no mention of the four new Ninja Turtles officially introduced in the “Lost Years” series.
As per IDW Publishing, here’s the official synopsis for “The Last Ronin”:
Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From legendary TMNT co-creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, get ready for the final story of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles three decades in the making! What terrible events destroyed his family and left New York a crumbling, post-apocalyptic nightmare? All will be revealed in this climactic Turtle tale that sees long-time friends becoming enemies and new allies emerging in the most unexpected places. Can the surviving Turtle triumph?

The Last Ronin Gameplay
Other than being compared to God of War, a third-person action-adventure video game, unfortunately, we don’t know anything about the gameplay for The Last Ronin. However, when it was first announced earlier this year, Doug Rosen suggested that Ninja Turtles, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, who are dead at the time of the story, could appear in a playable format in flashback sequences, which is how they appear in the comics, as well as in the form of Michelangelo’s hallucinations.
Rosen also added that there are opportunities to make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games for both young and older audiences, emphasizing that The Last Ronin would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be,” referring to the adult-themed nature of the comics.

2023-08-07 17:10:29+00:00,"Street Fighter 6, TMNT Crossover Announced",The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are popping up more and more and are even going to show up in Street Fighter 6.,"Street Fighter 6 had a big Evo. Aside from having the last grand finals match, Capcom showed more of its next DLC character, A.K.I. She was already announced, but the second reveal of the night was a complete surprise, as the company stated that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are crossing over with Street Fighter 6.
The TMNT Street Fighter 6 crossover includes a handful of cosmetics
The crossover is happening quite soon, too, as it is set to begin on August 8. Players will be able to unlock gear, emotes, titles, stamps, in-game device wallpapers, camera frames in Photo Mode, and the ability to turn their custom fighter used in World Tour and the Battle Hub into any of the four turtles.
This gear can been seen in the trailer, but it’s unclear how much it will all be or what will be tied to Drive Tickets (the currency players can earn in the game) or Fighter Coins (the premium currency). It also doesn’t seem to be tied to a battle pass, since the Street Fighter 6’s current battle pass that revolves around the franchise’s 36th anniversary doesn’t end until August 21.
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have crossed over with Street Fighter before in a recent comic, but they have also made their way into a few other gaming series, like the skateboarding title Session and now-shuttered dodgeball game Knockout City. Shredder was also in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2. The four turtles were even playable fighters in Injustice 2, as well, so this TMNT Street Fighter 6 crossover isn’t even their first foray into the fighting game genre.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L2dhbWVzL25ld3MvMTMxNTYzOC1zdHJlZXQtZmlnaHRlci02LXRtbnQtY3Jvc3NvdmVyLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXPSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21pbmdzb29uLm5ldC9nYW1lcy9uZXdzLzEzMTU2Mzgtc3RyZWV0LWZpZ2h0ZXItNi10bW50LWNyb3Nzb3Zlci10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Late-Summer Lightning Round,"Ninja Turtles, Clones, and Creepy Hands","(Composite / Photos: MovieStillsDB / Shutterstock)
Between the striking critical and commercial success of Oppenheimer and Barbie, the visually stylish Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Asteroid City, vibrant and lived-in indie features such as Past Lives and You Hurt My Feelings, and the general sense that audiences are finally tiring of sludgy, CGI sameness as represented by the failures of The Flash, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, it’s been a pretty good summer. So great that I haven’t had time to cover everything I’d like to. As such I’d just like to highlight three solid late-summer movies that deserve a little bit of love if you’ve got a couple hours to spare.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, like Barbie, is a two-hour toy commercial designed to hit the pleasure centers of a nostalgia-addled nation. Unlike Barbie, however, Mutant Mayhem has the decency to never insult the audience by pretending that it doubles as a critique of its advertisement-like nature. Importantly, it also understands exactly what it is and who it’s for: kids who want to see ninja turtle action with the occasional puke gag and adults who find the idea of Ice Cube delivering a sentient, steroidal housefly’s monologues amusing.
The setup will be familiar to anyone aware of any of the many iterations of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: a rat and four baby turtles are exposed to radioactive ooze in the sewers of Manhattan, mutating them into man-sized animals who learn martial arts and love pizza. Tired of living underground, the turtles yearn for the sweet air of freedom, which inevitably brings them into conflict with forces that yearn for their destruction. In this case, that destruction comes in the form of Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who has decided to mutate every animal on earth so as to eliminate humanity.
Share
Produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (among others), who paired previously on raunch-com high school classic Superbad (among others), Mutant Mayhem does a good job of capturing the eternal anxieties of adolescence: fear that the broader world will reject you; the desire to find kindred spirits who accept you for what you are; trying to avoid the wrath of your aging rodent father who has made a home for you and your mutant brothers in the sewers and believes mankind will destroy you if you ever make yourself seen in public. It’s lighthearted, funny, and vaguely absurdist: There’s a joke about an evil corporation “milking” the turtles of their radioactive essence so as to create more mutated monstrosities that winds up in such a literal-minded place I couldn’t help but guffaw at the screen.
Where Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem stands out is less on a scripting level—though, again, it’s pretty funny and moves along nicely—and more on a visual level. Alongside Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Mutant Mayhem is a reminder that the long-running CGI aesthetic we’ve all grown accustomed to—that sort of smooth, elegant fluidity that defines so much of Pixar and DreamWorks—has more or less run its course. The animation in Mutant Mayhem has a sort of designed raggedness to it: dust cloud squiggles that call to mind Charlie Brown’s pal Pigpen exist alongside hyperkinetic action of the sort you might see in an anime feature. It’s polished and crude at the same time, giving the screen an almost tactile sensibility. Director Jeff Rowe and the animators at Mikros Animation deserve every accolade they have coming their way for the look and feel of this movie.

Talk to Me and its success at the box office—it grossed $10 million in its opening last weekend, instantly making it one of the 20 most successful movies ever released by studio A24—is a reminder that one surefire way to strike gold in horror is to have teenagers doing stupid things that invite supernatural doom.
Mia (Sophie Wilde) is a bit of a weirdo and a loner, though she can be forgiven for that given the fact that her mother, Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen), committed suicide not long ago. She ignores her father, choosing instead to spend time with surrogate family Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and Riley (Joe Bird), whose mother Sue (Miranda Otto) has taken a shine to Mia. Mia is fascinated by a viral video craze sweeping her Australian town: while gripping a ceramic hand, saying “talk to me,” and then inviting the invisible spirits summoned into their bodies, kids are getting possessed and doing weird stuff for the delight of their contemporaries.
The obvious metaphor here is drug addiction—during the possessions, those infested by the restless spirits see their pupils dilate to unnatural size and they lose control of their bodily functions; it’s all such a rush that they can’t wait to do it over and over and over again, seemingly oblivious to the dangers of letting limbo-trapped souls inhabit your body—though social media comes in for a fair critique as well. There is also a sense that we’re seeing a playing out of trauma, given Rhea’s suicide and its effects on her family; it’s almost hard to have a horror movie these days without trauma being referenced at some point.
Talk to Me exudes creepiness in large part thanks to its makeup design; the ghosts that wander into the view of the game’s participants seem to be done with largely practical effects, lots of latex and gels and that sort of thing. I’d be curious to read up on how the directorial team of Michael and Danny Philippou managed a couple of the stunts, particularly one in the opening moments that prompted shocked gasps from the patrons in my theater.

What separates Talk to Me from some other entries in this genre is just how unrelentingly cruel it is; there’s a scene about two-thirds of the way through this movie that I won’t spoil except to say that it called to mind the children-in-peril sequences from Hereditary and this year’s Evil Dead Rise. The sequences are brutal; those of you with kids may prefer to skip this one altogether. But that brutality is effective in the same way that The Exorcist’s vulgarity was effective.

Talk to Me has a mild It Follows problem, in the sense that the rules of engagement with the spectral presence at the heart of the film are haphazardly defined and infrequently enforced. I can believe a ceramic hand opens a portal into limbo that allows contact with the damned, but only if that contact works in very precise ways each time. But I’ll forgive this venial mid-movie sin given Talk to Me’s corker of an ending. A great finale will make up for a lot of missteps earlier on.

They Cloned Tyrone is everything that’s good and bad about Netflix: It’s a weird little indie movie that’s going to wind up getting a much bigger audience than it otherwise might have thanks to the prominence of its placement on that service’s homepage but is probably 20 minutes too long and destined to be buried in the service’s back catalog—rather than living on as a cult classic until a niche Blu-ray distributor resurrects it for mass consumption.

Directed by Juel Taylor, who cowrote with Tony Rettenmaier, you’ll instantly get the tenor of They Cloned Tyrone via the set dressing. In the film’s very first shot, we open on an advertisement of a wide-eyed man gulping down “Somaah! Carbonated Beverage” and pull back to see folks acting foolishly outside of the convenience store on which the poster has been plastered. Combining Nineteen Eighty-Four’s Big Brother—given the locale and clientele, the model is conspicuously white—with the preferred narcotic of Brave New World into one handy image, this sort of subtle commentary on the nature of advertising and consumption persists throughout the picture. It’s there if you can pick up on it.

For instance, you might miss this on first viewing, but there’s a delicate hint at what the film is getting at when Fontaine (John Boyega), Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx), and Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) discover that fried chicken, hair-straightening products, urban churches, and hip hop are being used to control and modify the behavior of black residents. The three of them were merely trying to learn how it was that Fontaine survived being shot six times in a parking lot; instead, they uncovered a vast conspiracy involving mind control and, as the title suggests, cloning. It’s a conspiracy that the villainous enforcer played by Kiefer Sutherland will kill to protect. (Another subtle hint at what’s going on: Sutherland’s character is named Nixon.)

Give a gift membership

There’s something mildly amusing about the conceit of They Cloned Tyrone (or predecessors such as They Live!), namely that we’d need a vast, widespread conspiracy entrenched within our governmental and corporate bodies to seduce any given population into complacency. You can happily count on human nature to do the seduction: We love our simple pleasures and will happily be lulled by them, be they delicious fried food or the narcotized drip of streaming TV at war with sleep itself.

The lack of subtlety works in They Cloned Tyrone’s favor, just as it worked in the favor of They Live! or Pootie Tang or Sorry to Bother You: the over-the-top nature of it all keeps the picture from devolving into self-seriousness. It’s a message movie, yeah, but the movie itself is goofily endearing in a way that lessens the gravity and keeps us from getting weighed down. It helps that the performances are so good throughout; Jamie Foxx is perfect as pimp-past-his-prime Slick Charles. Alongside his recent supporting turn in the underseen God Is a Bullet, it’s a reminder that Foxx has an absolutely electric screen presence.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1cy50aGVidWx3YXJrLmNvbS9wL2xhdGUtc3VtbWVyLW1vdmllLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1yb3VuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 23:35:42+00:00,Seth Rogen on Why He’s Turned Off From Marvel and DC Projects: “It’s a Fear of the Process”,"Seth Rogen is revealing why ""fear of the process"" has turned him off from teaming up with Marvel and DC comics for movie or television projects.","Seth Rogen is always looking for a good indie comic to adapt for the screen, but he has a reason for avoiding Marvel and DC comics.

During a recent interview with Polygon, the actor-writer-producer, who is currently preparing for the release of his latest animated movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, on Aug. 2, revealed why “fear” has turned him off from teaming up with these other major movie franchises.

“We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan [Goldberg] have been writers for 20 years at this point,” he explained. “It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.”

Rogen continued, “It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with?”

The Platonic star emphasized that he and his writing partner prefer to feel like they have control and creative freedom with the projects they take on.

“What’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this,” he added. “So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!”

Earlier this year, Rogen told Total Film magazine that he does credit the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s content for making The Boys, based on a comic book series, possible, saying it “wouldn’t exist or be interesting” without the studio. “I think that Kevin Feige is a brilliant guy, and I think a lot of the filmmakers he’s hired to make these movies are great filmmakers,” he said at the time. “But as someone who doesn’t have children … It is [all] kind of geared towards kids, you know? There are times where I will forget. I’ll watch one of these things, as an adult with no kids, and be like, ‘Oh, this is just not for me.'”

When it comes to finding comics that do pique his interest, Rogen told Polygon that he first, looks for anything that’s not Marvel or DC, which “eliminates a lot right away,” and then seeks comics that have room for expansion.

“I would go to the comic book shop [when I was younger] and I would just walk around. And you see this comic book and it catches your eye, and you see that comic book and it catches your eye,” he said. “Those have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?“",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLXR1cm5lZC1vZmYtZnJvbS1tYXJ2ZWwtZGMtZmlsbXMtMTIzNTU0NzMzMi_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3Mvc2V0aC1yb2dlbi10dXJuZWQtb2ZmLWZyb20tbWFydmVsLWRjLWZpbG1zLTEyMzU1NDczMzIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 12:45:31+00:00,TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Filmmakers Wanted Animation to Be ‘Sketchy and Imperfect and Misshapen’,The animators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem were told to dumb down their art school skills to make the animation look more rough.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Filmmakers Wanted Animation To Be 'Sketchy And Imperfect And Misshapen'

This year has been a blessing for animation fans. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" surpassed expectations and became the biggest movie of the summer, ""Nimona"" finally was released on Netflix after Disney killed it, ""Suzume"" saw an anime maestro come full circle, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" made a crap ton of money, and ""The First Slam Dunk"" defeated ""The Way of Water"" at the box office with an incredible sports anime that paid off nearly 30-year-old storylines.

Next up is ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" the latest animated attempt at updating the classic characters to a new generation (""Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie"" was released just last year). I managed to see a work-in-progress screening at Annecy earlier this year and can say this is an incredible film, and a pure gift to animation fans.

Part of what makes this movie stand out is its visual style, with the 3D animation looking like doodles you'd do in a notebook as a teenager in class, something director Jeff Rowe says is a reaction to the push towards photorealism in 3D CG films.

""We decided we wanted this movie to look exactly like a concept artwork, and we want the concept artwork to feel distinctly human and not computer-generated,"" Rowe told Variety. ""And that means sketchy and imperfect and misshapen and reminiscent of the way you draw when you're a child or a teenager, and your passion and enthusiasm for making art hasn't been dimmed by formal art training.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM0MjQyMi90bW50LW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tZmlsbW1ha2Vycy13YW50ZWQtYW5pbWF0aW9uLXNrZXRjaHktaW1wZXJmZWN0LW1pc3NoYXBlbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 20:21:50+00:00,Hollywood Gets Snubbed in Saudi Arabia as Local-Language Films Begin to Dominate,Studio tentpoles have been muscled out of Middle East's biggest box office by Egyptian films and one record-breaking “uber local” Saudi feature,"There was a shock at the top of the Saudi Arabian box office the first weekend of 2023.

Avatar: The Way of Water, in its third week of release and still a dominant force across the planet on its way to an overall haul in excess of $2.3 billion, was knocked off its perch by an unexpected assailant (and one wearing a multicolored luchador mask).

The new titleholder: Sattar, a Saudi Arabian family comedy about a depressed man who follows his dreams of becoming a freestyle wrestling champion. The film — which had bowed at the Red Sea Film Festival just a month earlier (and where, ironically, the subject of Saudi films not performing had been a talking point) — smashed box office records, earning $2.2 million over its first 12 days, instantly making it the highest-grossing Saudi movie of all time. Granted, the local film industry literally didn’t exist just a few years ago and cinemas only opened in early 2018, but still — history was made.

From Kuwaiti director Abdullah Al Arak and led by popular Saudi actor and stand-up comedian Ibrahim Al Hajjaj, Sattar packed out cinemas, outpacing James Cameron’s Avatar sequel by more than 40 percent in terms of admissions and — fuelled by word of mouth — slipped just 11 percent in its second week.

Seven months on and Sattar is currently sitting pretty at the top of Saudi’s overall 2023 box office with an impressive haul of $10.7 million.

Sattar also potentially represents a worry for Hollywood studio execs who perhaps assumed they’d be claiming the lion’s share of what — in the space of just a few years — has become the biggest box office in the Middle East by some margin (total revenue of $242 million in 2022), the fastest-rising box office on the planet (it leaped to 15th in 2021 and held the position last year despite the post-pandemic recovery of others), and a box office that has been touted as potentially being worth some $1 billion by 2030.

Even before Sattar’s release just before the new year, lower-budget regional productions had increasingly been muscling out major studio tentpoles — many (many) times more expensive and backed by global marketing firepower — in a manner very few would have expected back in April 2018, when Black Panther became the first commercial film to be given a public screening in Saudi Arabia in 35 years. Blockbusters that have earned fortunes elsewhere simply haven’t landed at all in the country — not just edged out but entirely dominated by Arabic fare.

Sure, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny may have underperformed internationally, but in Saudi Arabia the film couldn’t even break the top three, lagging behind a trio of Egyptian comedies: Tag, House of Ruby (in its second week, having knocked out The Flash in its first) and The Boogeyman (not to be confused with 20th Century Studios’ recent Stephen King adaptation of the same name). The following weekend, the Indy finale slipped to seventh and to 13th by week three for a truly disappointing overall box office of around $1 million. But even many films that have exceeded expectations in most markets hit a sour note among Saudi cinemagoers: In 12 weeks, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (global haul in excess of $845 million) hasn’t managed to scrape $2 million together.

“Fifty percent of the population in Saudi does not speak English,” explains Gianluca Chakra, head of regional distributor Front Row, which, via its Front Row Arabia joint venture with exhibition giant Muvi, was behind the releases of Sattar, House of Ruby and The Boogeyman. “They just relate to local stuff.”

Sattar was the perfect example — a very localized story, starring well-known local figures, featuring Saudi folk music and set in the world of wrestling, which is phenomenally popular in the country (there’s good reason WWE has been taking shows there for half a decade and recently signed a deal worth tens of millions a year).

Sattar was also made by people who knew exactly what Saudis want to watch, coming from Al Shimaisi Films, the new production arm of local content kings Telfaz11, who became hugely popular for their groundbreaking comedic YouTube videos dating back to 2010 (the film was the brainchild of Telfaz11’s creative director Ibraheem El Khairallah, who also starred in it), and Muvi Studios, the new production arm of cinema chain Muvi, led by industry pioneer Faisal Baltyuour. Baltyuour, a prolific producer who previously led the Saudi Film Commission and was only tapped to launch Muvi Studios in mid 2022, described the results as a “groundbreaking start.”

As Chakra claims, Sattar was the first locally made film that “didn’t try to Americanize itself,” noting that it was so Saudi — “uber local,” down to the jokes, characters and expressions — that even other Arabs probably wouldn’t understand much of the humor.

“And people just resonated with it and kept going and watching it,” he says. “They saw themselves onscreen versus the other Saudi titles that have tried to perfect their stories by Americanizing the story and the way the films are shot, and people just say, this isn’t a Saudi film.”

There’s been a similar trend in neighboring Kuwait, a much smaller market with a population of 4.5 million compared to Saudi’s 37 million, but where the vast majority are Kuwaiti-born Arabic speakers (around the corner in the Gulf, the United Arab Emirates’ population of 10 million presents another sizable box office — and was the largest regional market pre-Saudi’s opening up — but there foreign-speaking expats vastly outnumber local Emiratis). Kuwait now represents the second-biggest market for Arabic features after Saudi.

Hisham Alghanim, vice chairman of the Kuwait National Cinema Co, the country’s biggest exhibitor, says that his company had dedicated a significant number of screens to Dial of Destiny in its first week — “We don’t joke with Indiana Jones!” — but such were the results they quickly had to reshuffle the schedule to prioritize the dominating Egyptian films. While he admits he’d already begun to shift focus away from Hollywood titles toward Arabic features in his cinemas, following Indy’s poor showing, Alghanim says he now won’t “take for granted” the major studio tentpoles, especially if there are “good quality” local features coming out the same time.

Like Sattar in Saudi, Kuwait had its own huge homegrown hit in 2021 with zany family comedy Ash Man, about a Kuwaiti superhero whose powers come from a popular local soup made of red beans, lentils and chickpeas. Alghanim says the producer was recently in touch about his follow-up film.

The success of Egyptian movies, particularly family comedies, isn’t a major surprise — the output of the Middle East’s most-established film industry has long been a regional box office regular and it has often relied on revenues coming from the Gulf. But the emergence of Saudi Arabia — which, thanks to its population and high ticket pricing, presents a massive financial boom should a film break through — has made the region more important than ever before to Egyptian producers, especially given Egypt’s economic woes at home (the local currency has plummeted in value).

The situation has, as Chakra notes, sparked more productions with higher budgets aimed at capturing the market (budgets now generally sit in the $1 million-$3.5 million range, still a tiny fraction of the films they’re competing against). This, plus the emergence of better-quality non-Egyptian Arabic films, and Saudi Arabia’s growing appetite for local-language fare, has helped spark the box office shift.

But there’s another important factor to take into account — the growing number of major Hollywood titles getting banned in Saudi Arabia (and also Kuwait, which is considered stricter).

The last couple of years have seen the likes of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Thor: Love and Thunder, Lightyear, Doctor Who in the Multiverse of Madness, Eternals and West Side Story among those blocked from cinemas. Although it’s rarely confirmed, all of these films are understood to have been prevented from getting a release due to LGBTQ scenes or references, often with the censors suggesting cuts that were then refused by the studios.

There are now concerns over whether Warner Bros.’ all-conquering cultural phenomenon Barbie — which looks set to be the biggest film of the year globally — will get a pass, having already shifted to the later release date of August. 31.

But while such revenue losses may be felt in Hollywood, they don’t appear to have dampened Saudi Arabia’s box office growth. The overall total of $242.5 million in 2022 was up on 2021’s $233.5 million, while the $123.2 million earned in the first half of 2023 suggests this year should climb further. Any holes from the loss of blocked Hollywood fare are being very easily filled by the earnings of local productions.

In 2022, four Arabic films made the year’s top 10. Beneath Sattar in the current top 10 for 2023 are five other Arabic titles, all Egyptian: Sugar Daddy, Baad Al Shar, House of Ruby, Etneen Lel Ajar and Nabil El Jamik. Chakra notes that, due to the much longer theatrical shelf life of Arabic features compared to their Western counterparts, which often make a splash and then quickly fizzle out, House of Ruby — which entered the top 10 in only its fourth week and is still in general release — will likely climb higher, while The Boogeyman, also still going strong four weeks on, should enter the top 10. Meanwhile, there’s no space for the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy 3, The Little Mermaid or indeed, Avatar: The Way of Water.

But it’s not all doom and gloom for Hollywood. Universal’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie did prove a major hit, earning $6.1 million (currently third), while the region’s penchant for action has given top 10 spots to Fast X, Plane and John Wick 4 (fifth, sixth and seventh, respectively, at the time of writing).

Last month, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One opened at the top of the box office and should have far sturdier legs than most other Hollywood blockbusters. “Most don’t last at all … unless it’s Tom Cruise,” suggests one producer (for all the success of Arabic films in 2022, the year’s best performer by some margin was Top Gun Maverick with $22 million, making Saudi the fourth-largest territory for Paramount’s smash hit across the Europe, the Middle East and Africa after the U.K., France and Germany).

Like Cruise, Christopher Nolan rarely misses in the Gulf (even an Interstellar re-release last year did solid figures). In the absence of Barbie, his latest blockbuster Oppenheimer had an outstanding opening last week, earning roughly $4.1 million, and will likely be among the year’s biggest. But even that doesn’t appear to have the staying power to match local entries. The Hollywood Reporter understands that the Egyptian comedy Mr. Ex — which released on the same date (and is rated 18 compared to Oppenheimer‘s 15) — has been outpacing the film since and will likely claim the top box office spot this week.

Trends suggest that, of this year’s upcoming Hollywood titles, video game adaptation Gran Turismo: The Movie, could do decent numbers, as might Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (although its release has just been postponed, sparking fears that, like Barbie, it could be in jeopardy).

But with the release of Mattel’s plastic powerhouse now in doubt, and no new Cruise or Super Mario titles on the immediate horizon, the near future could well be dominated by Arabic productions. Chakra says there are several more Egyptian films set to come out later this year (although he acknowledges it’s often a somewhat last-minute, “OK, we’re done with the sound; when are we releasing?” approach to scheduling), while a number of Saudi features are lining up for release in coming months.

And while Sattar may be the only Saudi film to have broken out on home soil so far, following its phenomenal success producers have no doubt been looking to copy its special recipe. For anyone taking note, the key ingredients seem to be: less Hollywood, more Saudi.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9zYXVkaS1hcmFiaWEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1hcmFiaWMtZmlsbXMtaG9sbHl3b29kLTEyMzU1NDc4ODMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL3NhdWRpLWFyYWJpYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWFyYWJpYy1maWxtcy1ob2xseXdvb2QtMTIzNTU0Nzg4My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This week’s report takes a preliminary look at two releases from major studios slated to open August 11: Gran Turismo and The Last Voyage of the Demeter.

Updated tracking for Barbie can also be found below, as the film continues to shatter expectations with pre-sales pacing higher than for any release since Black Panther: Wakanda Forever last November. Likewise, Oppenheimer is maintaining its relatively robust pace as the two films look to combine for a powerhouse weekend at the box office one week from now.

Gran Turismo

Sony Pictures

August 11, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $15M-$20M

Domestic Total Range: $35M-$55M

PROS:

The Gran Turismo video game franchise has endured over the last few decades, with its popularity helping to boost awareness and interest for this film adaptation.

Director Neill Blomkamp has had prior success with late summer releases in the form of District 9 and Elysium.

The movie’s fact-based approach to story—at its center is Jann Mardenborough, who went from playing the Gran Turismo game to embarking on a successful career as a professional race driver—might help this stand out from past video game adaptations.

CONS:

A significant amount of competition for male audiences will be in play late this summer, with Gran Turismo‘s opening weekend going up against the second frames of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and Meg 2: The Trench.

Hollywood’s actors joining writers in their ongoing strike could impact the talent promotion phase of marketing.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter

Universal Pictures

August 11, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $5M-$10M

Domestic Total Range: $14M-$28M

PROS:

Horror has quite often over-delivered at the box office in recent months and years. This summer, however, has been light on horror releases, which could spur interest here if reviews and audience buzz are positive.

CONS:

The film has been delayed several times by this point, and early social metrics aren’t encouraging. With abundant competition for male audiences and the aforementioned possibility of the actors’ strike affecting promotion, it’ll be challenging for this to stand out based on current models.

2023-07-26 15:00:00+00:00,"After a Decade in Limbo, Brian Robbins Is Giving Paramount a Makeover With ‘Ninja Turtles,’ Tom Cruise and ‘Gladiator 2’","Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins explains the film studio's new look, with ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and a ""Gladiator"" sequel.","Something was amiss with Michelangelo’s waistline.

Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the team behind the high school comedy “Superbad,” had sold Brian Robbins, the CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, on the idea of adding some adolescent anarchy into their animated reboot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But there was a problem with the initial designs for the film’s four reptile heroes: Instead of looking like muscular teens, these Turtles were scrawny and malnourished, barely strong enough to wield nunchucks or hurl a throwing star. “They looked like they were on Ozempic,” Robbins jokes.

In his peripatetic career, the 59-year-old Robbins has been on every end of these kind of creative discussions, working as an actor, writer, director, producer, digital entrepreneur and now, studio chief. And that separates him from other movie moguls, who arrive at the C-suite from MBA programs and years spent in the corporate trenches.

“He’s actually made movies, which puts him in a different category from most studio executives,” says Rogen. “He has a fundamental understanding of the process. He knows how to wrangle a movie into existence. So you can have a different kind of conversation with him.”

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the result of the four-year journey to reinvigorate the tired kid’s franchise, opens in theaters on Aug. 2, and Robbins is so bullish on what Rogen and Goldberg have delivered that he’s developing a sequel. In a sign of how much the entertainment business is changing, Paramount and Nickelodeon will also produce two seasons of a streaming series with the voice cast from the movies that will serve as a “bridge” between the films.

If “Mutant Mayhem” draws crowds, it will end Paramount’s summer on a high note. But as Robbins settles into a white leather chair on the deserted set of “CBS Mornings” in July, all the momentum he’s established at the studio he’s led for two years is about to collide with a pair of labor strikes that will bring Hollywood to a standstill. There are still 48 hours to go before contract negotiations collapse between the studios and the actors union, but Robbins knows where this is heading. “They’re going to strike,” he says with an air of resignation.

And on July 14 they do, sending 150,000 actors to the picket lines alongside the 11,500 screenwriters who have been holding out since May for a contract that, among other things, gives them more generous royalties from the streaming services that license their work. The effects of this industrywide shutdown are seismic — movies and shows have stopped shooting, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without paychecks. And the delicate social fabric of the entertainment ecosystem has frayed, with each side faulting the other for letting it come to this. As a member of the directors guild, as well as a former member of the actors union, Robbins has a unique perspective on what’s going on.

“I’ve been on all sides of it,” he says. “I’m a guy who went to my mailbox and got residuals. I know how important that is to actors and writers. There has to be a way forward, and hopefully we’ll find it soon. Strikes have happened before, but this one is taking place at a difficult time.”

Outside of “Barbie,” things aren’t going so hot for the Hollywood studios who write the diminishing residual checks. The cable business is vaporizing, movies have been eclipsed by TikTok and YouTube, and streaming, which was supposed to usher in a golden era of entertainment, turned out to be too expensive to maintain. As for the box office, it’s down nearly 20% from pre-COVID levels — a sign that the filmgoing audience could be more comfortable watching movies at home. Even two of Paramount’s biggest franchises, both in their seventh installments, are showing signs of aging. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” based on the popular toys, and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” Tom Cruise’s latest outing as agent Ethan Hunt, opened below expectations this summer. They will likely not turn a profit, given their massive budgets, in their theatrical runs.

“You can’t deny that cash flow at media companies is less than it was or that their share prices are way down,” Robbins says. “There’s been major disruption in this business. We’ll get through it, but we’re going through a painful transition.” He doesn’t seem to be sweating the situation, though it helps that the heavily air-conditioned “CBS Mornings” set makes that impossible. “Why do they always keep these places so cold?” Robbins says with a theatrical shiver that betrays years spent as one of the teen stars of “Head of the Class.” Those sitcom days are long past Robbins, who is presiding over Paramount as the studio has mounted an impressive revival, one supported by hits like “Top Gun: Maverick,” “The Lost City” and “Smile.” And on the horizon are sequels to “Paw Patrol” and “Gladiator,” as well as “If” from “A Quiet Place” director and actor John Krasinski.

Robbins has also established strong relationships with the creative community. “As big as the stakes are, he always stays cool,” says Christopher McQuarrie, the director of “Dead Reckoning Part One.” “He’s also the only head of studio who’s ever called me just to ask how I was doing.”

It’s a shift in fortunes for a studio that had spent much of the previous decade in limbo while its parent company was engulfed in corporate melodrama featuring a merger, leadership struggles and a feud involving its owners, the Redstone family. (The revolving door of names for the conglomerate that owns the studio morphed from Viacom to Viacom-CBS to, ultimately, Paramount Global, illustrating these chaotic shifts.) Robbins politely alludes to what came before when I tell him that visiting the Paramount lot at that time was eerie — a funereal quiet hung over the place.

“Yeah, they had a great run in the early aughts, and then there was a seismic shift, and there was a lot of drama corporately at Viacom, and it just created a downward spiral,” he says.

Paramount no longer feels like it’s been left behind by the business. While Robbins may be altering the perception of the studio, the knock on him is that the most successful films that Paramount has released during his tenure originated under the regime of his predecessor, Jim Gianopulos. Robbins counters that it can take decades to develop a project, to say nothing of the work that goes into making and marketing it. “You ask who greenlit a movie?” he says. “It’s semantics. There’s a lot of people that deserve credit for ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ or ‘Mission: Impossible.’ But over the last two years, it’s been up to my team to see these movies through production and bring them into the world.”

Studio executives tend to be hard-charging, blustery sorts. And while Robbins is a workaholic with a healthy ego, he’s got a laid-back energy that separates him from the pack. He punctuates sentences with “man,” sounding more like a surfer than a suit, and has an easygoing confidence that’s disarming.

“I’ve never seen Brian nervous,” says Kenan Thompson, who worked with Robbins on his first feature, 1997’s “Good Burger.” “He always has his legs crossed, giving off this air of ‘I’ve got this all under control.’”

“This is blowing my mind,” Robbins confesses to me. “This is totally surreal.”

And as I survey the scene in front of us on a muggy June night in Brooklyn, it’s hard to disagree. After all, I’m staring directly at Pete Davidson, who’s peacocking in a blue velour tracksuit that’s been spray-painted with the face of a Transformer, traversing a line of fans screeching at him for selfies. In the distance, there’s a 15-foot statue of an Autobot, a new addition to this stretch of Flatbush Avenue. It’s all part of the extravaganza that Paramount has orchestrated to promote “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” But that’s not what Robbins is referring to. It turns out he grew up in Marine Park, Brooklyn, a short subway ride from here. “We went back and forth on this street all the time,” he says. “I never would have thought I’d be at something like this.”

Robbins’ family relocated to Los Angeles when he was 14 so his father, an actor, could land better jobs. Growing up, he’d run lines with his dad before auditions. Eventually, Robbins decided to try out for things himself. He secured guest spots on “Knight Rider” and “Growing Pains” and was a finalist for “Risky Business” and “War Games” before landing his breakthrough role as a rebellious prodigy on “Head of the Class.”

“It was amazing,” Robbins says. “I was 18 years old, and I was on one of the biggest shows on television.”

He calls the sitcom his “film school.” On set, he befriended the crew, grilling them about their jobs. “Everyone was so open,” he remembers. “They let me hang out in the writers’ room or took me to the editing room and taught me how they selected shots.”

He decided that his future lay behind, not in front of, the camera. “Acting was not my path,” Robbins says. “I didn’t want to be in my 50s auditioning for guest spots on ‘CSI.’”

After “Head of the Class” ended in 1991, Robbins began directing and producing. He made the influential 1995 music documentary “The Show,” but his real talent was his ability to sense what younger viewers wanted to watch. And in the early ’90s, those kids were looking for their own version of “Saturday Night Live,” so Robbins and his producing partner Mike Tollin created “All That,” a sketch-comedy show starring teenagers that aired on Nickelodeon. That’s where he got the idea to take two of the show’s breakout stars, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, and shoot a low-budget movie called “Good Burger” about two high school fast-food workers. Paramount executives loved the idea, and when they asked who was directing the picture, Robbins pitched himself, despite having never made a feature film.

“The second I got back to my office, I turned to my assistant and said, ‘The good news is we’re making a movie. The bad news is I have to act like I know what I’m doing,’” Robbins says.

“Good Burger” was a hit, grossing $23.7 million on its $8.5 million budget, and Robbins was in demand. He used that clout to direct a range of films, including the football drama “Varsity Blues” and a remake of “The Shaggy Dog.” Because he’d spent years acting, Robbins had a knack for identifying promising young talent and coaxing performances from them.

“Brian was the first director who spoke to me as an actor,” says Michael B. Jordan, who had one of his early roles in “Hardball,” a sports drama that Robbins directed. “He helped me tap into what a fictional character would be feeling.”

Robbins also formed bonds with actors that outlasted the movies they made together. “Brian was like a second dad,” Thompson says. “He taught me the ropes. He always told me that when you go into meetings, you can’t be your normal relaxed self: ‘Sell a version of yourself that’s more exciting.’”

Dylan Coulter for Variety

Directing proved draining, requiring Robbins to be away from his family for long stretches of time. In 2009, as he was trying to figure out his next move, he noticed that his sons were growing more engrossed by YouTube than movies or TV. One of their favorite shows focused on Fred, a hyperactive teenager played by Lucas Cruikshank, which inspired Robbins to take that character and make a movie about him. To get it off the ground, he invested $1 million of his own money, eventually signing a deal to have it premiere on Nickelodeon, where it was a ratings hit.

“It proved I could be entrepreneurial,” Robbins says. It also left him wanting to move more aggressively into the emerging medium. So he came up with the idea for AwesomenessTV, a startup targeting tween YouTube users. “He saw where the audience was going before most people did,” says UTA chief Jeremy Zimmer, Robbins’ former agent.

Awesomeness eventually sold to DreamWorks Animation, and when DreamWorks Animation was itself sold to Comcast in 2017, Robbins left the company. That’s when he was approached by Paramount to run Paramount Players, a label making mid-budget comedies and dramas. It was a short 16-month stint before he was promoted to oversee Nickelodeon, which was struggling to recapture its 1990s dominance. But an even bigger job awaited.

Paramount Global chairwoman Shari Redstone, who had urged Robbins to take the job at Nickelodeon, says she became convinced that he was the right choice to reinvigorate Paramount. She wanted the studio to have a different vision. “Brian did not have the typical résumé,” she says. “He has his own way of looking at the business. I want us to be moving and changing and looking at the future, and I feel like Brian is making sure we don’t get left behind.”

Since taking over Paramount in 2021, Robbins has pushed the film team to work more closely with other divisions of Paramount Global. “If you look at our success, we made some great movies, but we marketed the living hell out of them,” he says. “And that’s because I did what no one else at Paramount had done. There was a moat around the studio, and I pulled up the drawbridge and said we’re going to work across the company.”

So that’s why CBS viewers were treated to an appearance by “Top Gun: Maverick” star Tom Cruise on an AFC Championship Game broadcast or audiences on MTV were offered a marathon of “Scream” movies in the lead-up to the latest sequel’s release. When we meet in July at “CBS Mornings,” Robbins isn’t there to be interviewed by Gayle King. He’s observing how the program is handling “Mission: Impossible” week, which has seen cast members stop by to enthuse about making the latest installment. All that cross-promotion is supposed to help “Mission: Impossible” achieve a cultural ubiquity that’s hard to pull off in a fractured media landscape.

The release of “Dead Reckoning Part One” marks the end of a turbulent production and a crisis that Robbins inherited on his first day on the job. The studio was at an impasse with Cruise and McQuarrie about the sequel’s runaway budget, which ultimately ballooned to nearly $300 million due to COVID shutdowns, and the filmmakers’ desire to add an expensive sequence involving a Russian submarine. That scene was originally slated to appear in the next installment, but Cruise and McQuarrie believed it was necessary to include earlier in the two-part story. However, the cost had to be assumed wholly by Paramount, because Skydance Media, which co-financed the movie, had a contract requiring the studio to assume overages beyond $240 million. Robbins avoids specifics, but admits things got thorny. “Let’s just say that the studio and the production and Tom were in a disagreement over direction, and there was a stalemate going on,” Robbins says. “We had to hit the pause button. They were stuck on how they were going to move forward with ‘Dead Reckoning Part Two’ while finishing ‘Part One.’”

So, I ask, was the disagreement over money? “It was a production issue, and it was about the scope of what was being asked for,” he says. “And the question we needed to ask was do we need this and why? And then how big is it going to be, and how long is that going to take?”

Appeasing Cruise wasn’t the only thing Robbins had to worry about in those early days. He was savaged in the press, partly because he was promoted as Gianopulos, a well-respected executive who had led Paramount since 2017, was pushed out.

Because Robbins had been an early advocate of YouTube, creating AwesomenessTV to make content for the platform, many assumed that he had sold Shari Redstone on a vision of dismantling the studio’s theatrical slate and sending everything to its streaming service. But the opposite is true — “Smile,” for instance, was supposed to debut on Paramount+, but after viewing a rough cut of the film, Robbins opted to release it theatrically. In fact, he’s primarily interested in making movies for cinemas, believing that the publicity that accompanies that kind of launch makes films more popular when they hit home entertainment.

“It was understandable,” Robbins says of the criticism. “Jim is a gentleman and a statesman of the movie business. The guy is adored — I adore him. He’s nothing but a class act. We live in a world where it’s easier for the press to get more readers by writing something negative than writing something positive.”

From Paramount this summer: “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One”; “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem”; and “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” Mission Impossible: Paramount Pictures and Skydance; Transformers: Paramount Pictures

Robbins downplays that time, but friends acknowledge that the blistering coverage stung him. (TheAnkler, a newsletter that covers Hollywood, branded Robbins “Norbit Man,” a reference to the critically excoriated Eddie Murphy comedy that he directed).

“You know what I said to him,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, Robbins’ friend and mentor, remembers. “Go back and Google what happened when Barry Diller was named CEO of Paramount. Go back and look at what the reaction was when Michael Eisner was named president of Paramount. Read about when Bob Daly was first named head of Warner Bros. For all of these greats, when they got their jobs, the reaction was harsh, skeptical and cynical. It worked out pretty great for them, and it will work out great for you. Just go do the job.”

It’s a glittering summer morning, and over breakfast Robbins and three of his most trusted Paramount colleagues are giving me a guided tour of all the reasons the movie business is so hazardous. The group includes Marc Weinstock, president of global marketing and distribution, as well as Michael Ireland and Daria Cercek, the co-heads of the motion picture group. The topic is why it’s so punishingly hard to make a movie these days. “You have to will movies to happen,” Robbins says. “The biggest problem with this business is people sit back and feel like a great movie is just going to come to them.”

That passivity has made studios reliant on sequels and superhero movies, often with diminishing returns. The past few weeks have seen new installments in long-running franchises such as “Indiana Jones” and “Fast and Furious” open to disappointing results, while comic book movies like “The Flash” failed to spark much interest. “There has to be a fresh approach to making franchises,” says Cercek. Ireland, looking up from a plate of Belgian waffles, agrees. “There needs to be a reason to make a sequel,” he says. “It can’t just be we’ve made six other versions of this same story, and here’s a seventh.”

Robbins calls it having “a big idea.” And in the case of the latest “Transformers” film, that eureka moment was to have G.I. Joe enter the robots’ cinematic universe, bringing together two of Paramount’s biggest franchises. But that required Robbins to convince Hasbro, the toy company behind both sets of characters, and producers Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay, to let the studio bring the worlds together. And Bay’s approval was tricky, because he was worried that merging the series would cheapen the other “Transformers” movies. “I called him 50 times,” Robbins says. “I would not let him off the hook. And when he finally stopped dodging my calls, we got him to sign off.”

Even with G.I. Joe’s firepower, the recent “Transformers” movie grossed a mediocre $427 million. “We feel it’s not great, but good” is Robbins’ spin. But the film’s struggles, he says, show the perils of a fading global box office. Russia, once the sixth-biggest market for films, has been closed off following its invasion of Ukraine. More consequential, China, which rivals the United States in ticket sales, has become an unreliable source of revenue for Hollywood films. That’s largely due to rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. In the case of “Rise of the Beasts,” the film grossed $90 million from China, half of what Paramount anticipated.

“China is a different marketplace,” says Weinstock. “You can’t count on it for a big number anymore, so everyone needs to reevaluate their budgets.”

Most summer movies carry staggering price tags. During COVID, many of these productions saw costs escalate by tens of millions of dollars. And though pandemic shutdowns have eased, inflation makes it hard to economize. How, I wonder, will Robbins and his team make cheaper movies?

“It’s no one’s fault,” says Robbins. “COVID and inflation took the $100 million movies and made them cost $200 million. But movie tickets didn’t go from $12 to $24. We have to ask: How do we build movies? What’s necessary? We need to make smart choices. You can’t have everything, but you need that foundation to be strong.”

Years ago, studios could build their movies around movie stars, but Hollywood has done a crappy job of replenishing its cosmos of leading men and women. Instead, they’ve leaned into comic book adaptations, where costumed heroes are the draw, not the actors behind the mask. That makes it difficult to produce other kinds of movies, such as dramas and rom-coms, that rely on personalities, not superpowers, to attract crowds.

Paramount’s leaders want to invest in a new generation of talent. They’re developing “The Saint,” a remake of the Roger Moore spy series that will star “Bridgerton’s” Regé-Jean Page. And for the “Gladiator” sequel, the studio is teaming veteran actor Denzel Washington with the 27-year-old Paul Mescal, recently Oscar nominated for his work in the indie “Aftersun.” To see if Mescal could fill out a toga, Cercek and Ireland watched his performance in the West End revival of “A Streetcar Named Desire.” “He played Stanley, and there are several moments where he takes off his shirt and it was electric,” Cercek says. “The ladies in the audience were very vocal, and we were like, ‘I think we’ve found our guy.’”

Even a star’s ability to make audiences swoon isn’t always enough to guarantee that a movie will make money. “Babylon,” an epic about the silent movie era, collapsed at the box office when Paramount released it last December, despite starring Brad Pitt, while “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” will lose money even though Chris Pine led the ensemble. Robbins isn’t abandoning the idea of more “Dungeons & Dragons,” though if there’s a sequel, he says, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make it for less.” As for “Babylon,” that one hurt because Robbins believes in Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning “La La Land” director who made the movie. “It broke my soul to have ‘Babylon’ not do well,” Robbins admits when we meet for the first time in April. “There’s people who loved the movie and there’s people who hated the movie, but you can’t deny it’s an ambitious fucking movie.”

Costs may be rising while the box office is contracting, but Robbins sees areas of opportunity. He’s overhauled Paramount’s animation division, raiding Nickelodeon’s vault and jettisoning projects that he didn’t think were commercial. “Under the Boardwalk,” a movie about hermit crabs on the Jersey Shore that predated Robbins, will debut on Paramount+, not in theaters. “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,” he says.

Instead, the studio’s upcoming animated releases will center on familiar properties such as “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” which Robbins thinks will appeal to millennials who grew up with the shows.

“It’s not about Disney and Pixar anymore,” he says, noting that recent Disney films like “Elemental” and “Lightyear” have stumbled at the box office. “People are looking for animated movies that are irreverent and have a comedic point of view.”

Robbins and his team believe that they can successfully navigate an uncertain future for movies. But even the smartest executives or the most brilliant filmmakers and brightest stars may not be skilled enough to overcome the cultural and economic forces that are reshaping entertainment. Movies are enormous investments of time and resources, and with younger consumers growing more passionate about video games or social media, can the film business remain viable? Hollywood is already in a defensive crouch, with media conglomerates that once bragged about the billions they were shelling out for “content” now signaling they want to cut costs or sell assets. Analysts believe all this tumult could spark a fresh wave of mergers. So what would that mean for a company like Paramount Global and the studio Robbins runs?

“There’s a whole lot of uncertainty,” says Peter Newman, head of NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ MFA/MBA program. “Will more of these media companies combine? Or does someone like an Apple decide they want to take over a traditional studio?”

Back at “CBS Mornings,” Robbins looks like a man in dire need of an espresso as he rubs his eyes. He’s been out until 2 a.m., attending a lavish New York premiere for “Mission: Impossible” and then partying with the cast after the event. It must, I think, have required him to be always “on,” emanating the “exciting version” of himself that Robbins once advised Thompson to be while pitching studio executives.

Of course, Robbins is now on the other side of the desk, and that changes things. And part of his job requires saying no— rejecting a story idea or, say, informing Tom Cruise that he can’t shoot a sequence with a submarine (in the latter case, the answer was yes, because the latest “Mission: Impossible” kicks off with one).

“Delivering tough news is part of the job,” Robbins admits. “It’s about having a hard conversation. And hopefully, at the end of that talk, you still have mutual respect, or you find a way to come to a compromise. It’s not a fun part of the job.”

“Last night,” Robbins says, his mouth inching into a grin. “Last night was way more fun.”

These interviews were conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began.

2023-08-19 15:45:00+00:00,TMNT: MUTANT MAYHEM Concept Art Spotlights Mutant Characters Who Didn't Appear,"Some new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem concept art has been shared online, and it reveals that several original mutant character were originally going to appear...","Concept artist Dustin d'Arnault has shared some of his designs for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and it reveals a number of weird and wonderful characters that didn't end up featuring in the movie.

The Seth Rogen-produced animated reboot introduced new versions of several well-known heroes and villains from TMNT lore, but it seems a few original mutants were also considered early on in the production process.

As d'Arnault explains in his caption, Wingnut is the only established character pictured here (and the only one who appeared in the movie), and she's joined by some pretty awesome-looking fellow hybrids.

""I had the incredible opportunity to come up with some new mutant characters for the film. All of them, save for Wingnut, are unique designs. Dubbed 'Pro-Mutants,' they were envisioned as government-funded mutant soldiers developed by Baxter for the US Military and Nickelodeon Consumer Products complex. Though the script took a different turn, I'm still holding out for the day when my boys—Cmdr. Roy Fin, Suckerpunch, and the rest of the squad—find their place in the TMNT universe!""

The artist also reveals that the movie's ending was originally going to be a little different, with the entire population of New York City mutated into human/animal hybrids (we assume they would have changed back after Superfly's defeat).

""During the initial phases of production, the script envisioned a final act where the entire NYC population was mutated. Here are some rough concepts of animal and hybrid character designs.

Check out the designs at the links below.

“After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.”

Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon will voice the roles of Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael, respectively. The cast also includes Jackie Chan as Splinter, Hannibal Buress as Genghis Frog, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, Ice Cube as Superfly, Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut, Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Post Malone as Ray Fillet, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, and Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom.

2023-07-21 06:00:00-04:00,"Non-profit urges parents to buy toys, not real turtles ahead of 'Ninja Turtles' movie release","As the release of the ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ movie draws near, a U.S. animal non-profit is urging parents to purchase toys for their children instead of live turtles.","As the release of the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" movie approaches, the American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) is urging parents to purchase toys for their children instead of live turtles.

This is set to be the seventh theatrical release in the Ninja Turtles franchise. The ATR says many kids frequently ask parents to buy live turtles as an “impulse buy” after the release of previous Ninja Turtles films, leading to tragic consequences as many turtles lose their lives in the pet trade.

“Sadly, after bringing the turtle home, sticking it in a small tank, and waiting for it to perform, kids abandon interest when nothing happens – the turtle just sits there.” ATR said in the plea.

As the first national turtle and tortoise rescue organization in the U.S., ATR recommends that the best thing that parents can do is purchase action figure toys that actually mimic the ninja movements from the film.

“I like to say putting a turtle in a tank is how we would feel if we had to live in a bathtub all our lives,” co-founder and executive director of ATR Susan Tellem said in a press release.

“Sadly, most of these turtles were abandoned in shelters and rescues or dumped into lakes and waterways (or worse toilets) after the movie’s young fans found out that the real turtles did not fight crime or perform incredible stunts.”

Tellem says that the consequences of buying live turtles have been disastrous for thousands of these creatures, particularly, the red-eared sliders.

The ATR says that these turtles should only be adopted by individuals with private ponds that can mimic their natural habitat.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" is set to be released in theatres across North America on Aug. 2.

2023-08-19 10:02:35+01:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,,"What do we talk about, when we talk about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem? What seemed like a dormant big-screen franchise has been successfully rebooted to the tune of $100+ million in a couple of weeks at the global box-office, with a sequel and follow-up series already coming down the sewer pipe in short order. This animated feature rolls back multiple cinematic wrong-turns to double down on the first thing we ever knew about the Ninja Turtles; they’re meant to be teenagers, duh. And being a teenager is about more than shouting ‘Cowabunga dude’ and liking pizza; there’s a world of growing-up angst to be explored, and fortunately the team behind Jeff Rowe’s Mutant Mayhem deliver on that promise of authentic teen voices.

Lines like ‘I know it’s objectively prejudiced but that’s what they taught us,’ flag up early that these ain’t the bland characters we’ve previously known; this is an origin story for the loquacious ‘little Shreks’. It’s also a self-proclaimed ‘tragic backstory’ of sorts; we see the turtles in a lab, getting doused with the mysterious, power-sharing ooze, meeting up with their adoptive rat father Splinter (Jackie Chan) and introduced to tv reporter April O’Neill (Ado Edeberi). Yes, every generation gets the April O’Neill they deserve, and while others made do with Sarah Michelle Gellar or Megan Fox, this April is known as ‘puke girl’ due to her tendency to vomit when nervous. Once assembled, the team are up against extremist antagonist Superfly (Ice Cube), who shares the turtles’ dream of acceptance by the outside world, but seeks it in a rather more direct way…

Mutant Mayhem also resolves multiple issues about the size and scope of a turtle adventure by focusing on the traditionally ignored business of fighting crime; the meat and potatoes of any kind of super-hero, so no time-travel, multiverses, vortexes, portals or any of that nonsense; we’re firmly in scuzzy New York City and foiling robberies is how the turtles aim to win our hearts. ‘You sound like such a leader…that was so heartfelt bro,’ is the kind of cheery dialogue that lays bare the crushing need to be liked that the turtles share as a common cause. It’s not easy to miss the influence of Superbad’s Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg on the funky new direction here, but they generally rein in their cruder impulses in this family friendly feature; they keep it clean AND keep it green. It’s also, in the vein of the Spiderverse animations, impressive to look at, with a knowing super-stoner sound track including Take it To The Limit, Eye Know by De La Soul, Can I Kick it? by A Tribe Called Quest and of course, Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s Shimmy Shimmy Ya.

‘I like your vibe’ says one of their allies Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), and Mutant Mayhem is a movie that surprisingly manages to cause far more of the warm and fuzzy feels we’d hope for in a TMNT movie. As with Barbie, the secret of reviving old IP is having a fresh and relevant vision that expands on the original promise of the material; TMNT: MM has all that in plentiful quality. Even if they don’t have nipples, or last names, these guys are easily the best big-screen version of the Turtles we’ve seen to date; with Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne and other talent properly engaged, it’s one of 2023’s most surprising successes. It’s also a kids/family film that’s smarter than most films for adults, and should cross-over to audiences of all ages; in the immortal words of Y Kid K, get ready to spin that wheel, because these heroic turtles just got real. Awesome!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmlsbS1hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTkvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“I was like, ‘I’m going to do my best Eric Bana.’ This is an homage to Eric,” Byrne continues. “It was a group recording, and I’d never done that before for a voice job. Seth was there, and he had such high energy from beginning to end. There’s ‘Mayhem’ in the title, and it was like mayhem. Not in a bad way. It was fun mayhem.”

More from Variety

Byrne joked that her many collaborations with Rogen, which include the 2014 comedy “Neighbors” and Apple TV+’s “Platonic,” don’t have her husband, Bobby Cannavale, worried. “He’s our biggest cheerleader,” she says. “He totally gets it. He’s like, ‘You’re so different and it just works.’ It’s really cute.”

Variety exclusively reported that Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies are developing a sequel to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” as well as a two-season series that will serve as a “bridge” between the films. The spinoff series, titled “Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” will be streamed on Paramount+.

The sequel will be produced by Point Grey Pictures and directed by Jeff Rowe, who is also the director and co-writer of “Mutant Mayhem.” Point Grey Pictures is also producing the Paramount+ series. Chris Yost (“Secret Headquarters,” “The Mandalorian,” “Thor: Ragnorok”) and Alan Wan (“Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” [2012 Series]) will be serving as executive producers and showrunners. Lukas Williams will be overseeing both the series and sequel for Point Grey.

This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began.

,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Reveals Alternate April O'Neil Designs,Character Designer James A. Castillo took to Twitter to share some alternate designs of April O'Neil.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is now playing in theaters, and the new animated feature is a hit with critics and audiences alike.

Ayo Edebiri Talks Playing April O'Neil:

Edebiri spoke with Collider ahead of the SAG strike, and she had nothing but praise for the new version of April O'Neil.

""I think the fact that she's a journalist, that she's got this friendship and this bond with them, and is such an iconic character to people, I feel like there's just a lot of people who have so much fondness for her,"" Edebiri shared. ""[Laughs] A lot of early first crushes. But I loved that in this iteration I felt like she had so much agency and was her own person and had her own goals and uses that or feels that in tandem with the Turtles, if that makes sense. She has her own goals, she has her own drive, she wants to crack a story, but she realizes throughout the journey of the movie also how important friendship is with these little Turtle freaks.""

2023-08-13 03:26:00+00:00,New TMNT: MUTANT MAYHEM Concept Art Highlights Early Character Designs For Splinter,"Along with the titular Heroes in a Half-Shell, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem introduced a new take on Splinter, and we now have a look at some early concept designs for the character...","Concept artist James A. Castillo recently shared some of his alternate designs for April O'Neill, and we now have a look at his early artwork for the Heroes in a Half-Shell's wise mentor/father, Splinter.

Unlike the April designs, these don't look much different to the version of Splinter we saw in the movie (those somewhat unsettling x-ray-style sketches are simply to illustrate his facial structure), but the animated reboot's take on the character was quite a departure.

Generally depicted as a calm, extremely skilled sensei, Splinter was reimagined as a lonely, overly-concerned dad who longs for someone to share his life with. It works for this take on the TMNT, but some long-time fans have taken issue with this and certain other changes to the ""established"" lore.

Spoilers follow.

At the end of the movie, Splinter does find that special someone in the form of... Scumbug!

“After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.”

This week’s report takes a look at box office prospects for Haunted Mansion, Disney’s next IP reimagining slated for release in late July.

The latest tracking updates for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Barbie, Oppenheimer, and other upcoming releases are featured in the chart below.

Haunted Mansion

Walt Disney Pictures

July 28, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $22M-$37M

Domestic Total Range: $73M-$131M

PROS:

Based on the classic theme park attraction at Walt Disney World, Haunted Mansion will have built-in awareness among families that could prove advantageous. Disney’s prior adaptation, The Haunted Mansion with Eddie Murphy, posted $75.9 million in its 2003 domestic run.

A strong ensemble cast and comedic approach are drivers in positive early buzz, with trailers generating healthy online sentiment.

Pre-sales have only begun and will not truly pop until closer to release, but worth nothing is that’s its first day of activity lagged only 11 percent behind Jungle Cruise‘s first day of sales in sample markets.

Minimal direct competition leading into release could elevate demand among family moviegoers.

CONS:

Disney has struggled to recover its full share of the pre-pandemic theatrical audience, due in large part to the company’s brief-but-impactful focus on streaming launches for family titles during the height of Covid-19.

If Barbie manages to take off with women and families beyond its strongly hyped opening weekend, that may put a ceiling on Haunted Mansion‘s ability to soar. The male-driven Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will also be a factor when it opens one week later on August 2.

Given the dearth of family-friendly titles on the theatrical slate this fall, the argument could be made that this film would be better positioned with a release in September or October when it could benefit from proximity to Halloween.

2023-08-13 19:03:50-04:00,Box Office Report of the Week of August 13,"Barbenheimer is dominating for the fourth straight weekend, while The Last Voyage of the Demeter bombs. Read more:","With Gran Turismo being moved to August 25 at the last minute, Barbenheimer is again enjoying another week with no signs of slowing down! The Neill Blomkamp-directed adaptation of Polyphony Digital’s game did have some advance screenings over the weekend, but the true test will be when the film releases wide. As for now, Barbie and Oppenheimer are our numbers one and two films of the week, with Christopher Nolan’s biopic claiming the second spot after Meg 2: The Trench briefly dethroned the film last week. Additionally, Oppenheimer is expected to finish its run at $900 million. Incredible.



Word of mouth seems to be taking a giant bite out of Meg 2’s box office, as it dropped to 57% and fell to fourth place, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem sitting at third. The positive word-of-mouth seems to work for this one, though I doubt we’ll see a sleeper hit à la Elemental. Still, time could be favorable for the Turtles as the slate dries up for family-friendly fare post-Barbie in the next few weeks.



Our only new release this weekend is Universal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter, which predictably bombed, beginning its run in sixth place with a $6.5 million tally out of a $45 million budget. I could’ve told you many months ago that it would’ve tanked based on the title and Universal’s desire to market it barely. As cheesy as the title Boat Dracula could be, it would’ve been better than The Last Voyage of the Demeter.



It’s a mouthful, but it tells nothing about the movie. Yes, those knowledgeable about Dracula will know, but what about the average moviegoer? I doubt they even knew the movie existed in the first place. Unlike Gran Turismo, whose trailer played in front of every movie I saw since it came out (even Elemental), The Last Voyage of the Demeter had one trailer with little exposure beyond horror movies.

On the other hand, Talk to Me is holding surprisingly well, as more moviegoers are seemingly ditching mainstream horror movies in favor of independent horror, having only dropped at 19% this weekend with a $5.1 million tally. It’s already made its money back, so no wonder a sequel is currently in the works.

Here’s the full list of the top ten films of the week:

Barbie (Warner Bros.): $33.7M (-36.4%) – 4,178 theatres Oppenheimer (Universal): $18.8M (-35.4%) – 3,761 theatres Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Paramount): $15.7M (-43.8%) – 3,950 theatres Meg 2: The Trench (Warner Bros): $12.7M (-57.7%) – 3,604 theatres The Last Voyage of the Demeter (Universal): $6.5M – 2,715 theatres Haunted Mansion (Disney): $5.6M (-39.1%) – 2,379 theatres Talk to Me (A24): $5.1M (-19%) – 2,379 theatres Sound of Freedom (Angel Studios): $4.8M (-36.2%) – 2,803 theatres Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning – Part One (Paramount): $4.6M (-29.4%) – 2,135 theatres Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Disney): $899.000 (-43.6%) – 790 theatres

2023-08-15 11:00:00+00:00,Universal Had Two Different Dracula Movies Flop At The Box Office This Year,"Renfield and The Last Voyage of the Demeter told very different Dracula tales, but neither film could sink their teeth into the box office.","Universal Had Two Different Dracula Movies Flop At The Box Office This Year

Universal Pictures has had a pretty damn good year at the box office, with ""M3GAN"" serving as one of the biggest original hits of the year, and ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" currently standing alone as the highest-grossing movie of the year (but ""Barbie"" might have something to say about that soon). But moviemaking is always a gamble of sorts, and some gambles just don't pay off. Case in point, the studio suffered a sizable flop over the weekend with ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter,"" as the film debuted to a tiny $6.5 million, placing fifth on the charts well behind ""Meg 2: The Trench,"" which was in its second weekend. Most amazing of all? It was the second time this year that Universal found itself on the wrong side of a flop involving Dracula.

Back in April, the studio released director Chris McKay's ""Renfield,"" named after Dracula's faithful assistant who has been a part of the vampire's story from the beginning. He was given the spotlight in this new take on the material, as portrayed by Nicholas Hoult, with none other than Nicolas Cage on board as Dracula. It was an inspired bit of casting but the movie itself just didn't catch on with audiences. It lost to ""The Pope's Exorcist"" on opening weekend and, ultimately, topped out at just $26.7 million worldwide, per The Numbers. Against a reported $65 million production budget, it represents a costly disaster.

Similarly, director André Øvredal's ""Last Voyage of the Demeter"" represents a fascinating take on Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" adapting a single chapter from the classic book. It's a movie that has been in development for literal decades and finally managed to get off the ground. Unfortunately, ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" are still going strong, as is ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem."" It kind of got buried as a result and now has to navigate very choppy waters in the coming weeks. It will be very lucky to get to $25 million domestically at this point, and its international prospects are quite grim.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM2NjE2Ny91bml2ZXJzYWwtdHdvLWRyYWN1bGEtbW92aWVzLWZsb3AtYXQtdGhlLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The summer movie season’s final weeks are upon us, with less than a handful of major studio releases remaining on the slate before Labor Day. This weekend, two of them will make a play to temporarily outrank the reigning blockbusters atop the box office.

Blue Beetle

Warner Bros. Pictures

August 18, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $22M-$32M

PROS:

The core DC fan base and potential to over-index among Hispanic families could help Blue Beetle come in slightly above what have until recently been bearish tracking ranges. The title character having low prior exposure among audiences means the film should be less front-loaded than the likes of The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods earlier this year.

Strays will counter as an R-rated comedy, with a voice cast lead by Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx. As the first bona fide comedy to open since Barbie, there remains some sleeper potential a la fellow August openers Good Boys (2019) and Sausage Party (2016).

Barbie and Oppenheimer will remain mostly uncontested for each one’s primary audience in their fifth weekend of release, with some caveats (noted below).

Strays

Universal Pictures

August 18, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $11M-$18M

CONS:

Without clear hooks, superhero films are enduring some regression at the box office, and Blue Beetle‘s pre-sales currently trail those of the Shazam! sequel. The staying power of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem could also be a minor factor in limiting family turnout, as could be the start of the school year, with 30 percent of K-12 students back in class as of this Friday (up from 19 percent on August 4).

Strays‘ marketing impact has left something to be desired, perhaps exemplified in pre-sale trends that lag behind fellow R-rated comedies No Hard Feelings and Cocaine Bear.

With a family-friendly film and an adult-centric comedy opening this weekend, Barbie might stand to face slight audience runoff. Oppenheimer, meanwhile, will shed its exclusive Imax footprint to Blue Beetle. The Christopher Nolan film earned an estimated 30 percent of its fourth frame gross from Imax venues alone, meaning week-to-week declines will become slightly inflated for a brief period of time.

Current projection ranges call for a 48% increase from the comparable weekend’s top ten aggregate of $69.3 million in 2022 and a 1% increase from 2019’s $101.9 million.

2023-06-24 18:19:32+00:00,"Elemental Is Still In The Game, Thanks To A Strong Second Weekend Box Office Hold","Despite a slow start, Pixar's Elemental is holding strong with a drop of 39 percent or less in its second weekend at the box office.","Elemental Is Still In The Game, Thanks To A Strong Second Weekend Box Office Hold

Last weekend's big movie releases started off in similarly dismal positions at the box office, but now they're heading in very different directions. While ""The Flash"" is looking at a rough second weekend drop of more than 70 percent, it looks like Pixar's ""Elemental"" still has a chance to turn things around. The colorful animated tale of fire-and-water romance is set to drop by 39 percent or less in its sophomore weekend.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Friday's numbers put ""Elemental"" in a tight race with ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" for the No. 1 spot at the box office this weekend, with both movies expected to gross $17-19 million. That's obviously an outstanding showing for ""Across the Spider-Verse,"" which is now in its fourth weekend at the box office and thriving despite the summer competition. The animated superhero film is expected to pass $300 million at the domestic box office on Sunday.

But while ""Across the Spider-Verse"" was already safely a hit, strong legs could be an essential lifeline for ""Elemental."" Pixar has been struggling to find its feet at the box office since Disney released three of its movies — ""Soul,"" ""Luca,"" and ""Turning Red"" — direct to streaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following back-to-back hits ""Incredibles 2"" and ""Toy Story 4,"" the animation studio's return to theaters in 2022 was less than triumphant, with ""Lightyear"" grossing $50.5 million at the box office in its domestic debut, and dropping 65 percent in its second weekend. Though ""Elemental"" opened even lower, at $26.9 million, it could end up outpacing ""Lightyear"" if this hold continues.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTMyMjUwMy9lbGVtZW50YWwtc3RpbGwtaW4tZ2FtZS1zdHJvbmctc2Vjb25kLXdlZWtlbmQtYm94LW9mZmljZS1ob2xkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-17 05:13:21+00:00,Summer Blockbusters: Box Office Successes like ‘Barbie’ Bring Audiences Back to the Movies,,"With the release of blockbusters like “The Little Mermaid,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” and the famed “Barbenheimer” internet rivalry, cinematic experiences made a comeback to the big screen this summer.

Amid the progressing SAG-AFTRA writer’s strike in the entertainment world, the period of scarce new written material from Hollywood may lead to fewer films in theaters in the coming years. Nevertheless, audiences flocked to the theaters to catch major studio releases this summer and enjoyed the moviegoing experience — which, for now, remains unaffected by the strike.

On May 26, the release of Disney’s live-action film “The Little Mermaid” kicked off the start of the summer film season. Ariel, portrayed by singer and actress Halle Bailey, found new breath in the reimagined re-make of the animated 1989 film. Despite being a remake of a familiar story, the movie was a box-office hit and successfully scored an estimated $296 million in the United States and Canada, according to IMDb.

For some fanatics, summer film festivities began in the south of France at the Cannes Film Festival. Each year, a plethora of actors, filmmakers and members of the press converge in Cannes, France for a two-week preview of films and series from around the world May 14-25.

Major films, such as “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” premiered at the French festival before their wider commercial release later in the year. Director Wes Anderson debuted his latest work “Asteroid City” at the Cannes Film Festival earlier in May, alongside other exciting works like the upcoming Scorsese Oscar-contender “Killers of the Flower Moon” and HBO’s controversial and short-lived series “The Idol.”

After festival season, audiences sought out adventure in their cinema. In June, Miles Morales returned to the screen in the “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” for the newest addition to Sony’s Spider-Verse storyline. Miles, voiced by Shameik Moore, joins Gwen Stacy, voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, in this energetic sequel to the animated 2018 “Into the Spider-Verse.”

The second film in the Spider-Verse franchise was met with support from critics and audiences alike, bestowing a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes.

In July, thrilling franchises like the new Insidious film, “The Red Door” and “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Part One,” descended upon cinemas to bring audiences to the edge of their seats. “Red Door” viewers expected more midsummer scares than the Insidious sequel could deliver, and the film earned a low 39% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Conversely, Tom Cruise‘s return as Ethan Hunt in “Dead Reckoning” left audiences pleased with the seventh addition to the Mission Impossible franchise, as viewers rated the movie at 96% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Undoubtedly it was July’s same-day release of Greta Gerwig‘s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” that blew box office records out of the water. With the help of the internet and strategic studio marketing for the blockbusters, masses flocked to theaters July 21, to watch both films as a “Barbenheimer” double-feature.

Margot Robbie produced and starred as the titular “Barbie” in the female-driven film that reimagines the iconic Mattel doll in modern-day Los Angeles. Despite the film’s glitzy pink backdrop and dreamy costumery, “Barbie” deals with self-realization, existentialism and finding purpose.

Starring eminent actors like Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera and Will Ferrell, the long-awaited “Barbie” was met with widespread support from children and adults alike and scored an 88% rating from audiences.

In contrast with Gerwig’s dreamscape of glitz and glam, director Nolan’s world went dark in “Oppenheimer” as he focused on the creator of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Set in the United States during World War II, the film stars Cillian Murphy as the world-famous physicist whose findings would forever change the trajectory of chemical warfare. The movie boasts supporting actors such as Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh, and audiences rated the ominous biographical thriller highly at 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.

In August, audiences sought adventure with Jeff Rowe’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.” Released Aug. 2, the iconic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles inspired awesomeness in their latest animated feature “Mutant Mayhem.” In this new chapter, the teen turtles come of age in Brooklyn, New York and try to fit in while fighting crime.

The film earned a 96% rating from Rotten Tomatoes and left viewers with a taste for adventure. Action movie enthusiasts can look forward to DC Comics’ upcoming Aug. 18 release, “Blue Beetle,” which presents viewers with a jam-packed escapade.

Many viewers returned to theaters for the first time in three years after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Movies from the 2023 summer season shattered box office records, even rivaling the earnings of pre-pandemic blockbusters.

While the writers’ strike may delay upcoming films from further production, this season exemplifies the type of magic movies bring viewers.

2023-08-10 00:09:11+00:00,Pixar’s President Explains Why The Studio’s Films Cost So Much – And It’s Not For The Reason You Think,Pixar's president offers some good reasons for why 'Elemental' cost $200 million to produce.,"A question we often get from readers is why Pixar films cost more to produce than big-budget features from other studios.

Using some of this year’s theatrical releases as examples, the reported production budget for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was between $100-150 million, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was around $100M, and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem came in at $70M apiece. Meanwhile, Disney-Pixar’s Elemental has been said to cost a whopping $200M.

What is causing the big differential in budgets? A common misconception is that Pixar’s films cost more because of the visual and technical complexity of the films. But according to Pixar president Jim Morris (pictured at top), that’s not necessarily the main reason. In a new interview with Variety, Morris explained the different factors that increase the cost of Pixar’s productions.

Pixar’s films are made in the United States

“One of the ways you make these films for less money, and almost all of our competitors do this, is to do work offshore,” Morris told Variety. “It’s only us and Disney Animation that makes animation films in the U.S. anymore with all of the artists under one roof. We feel like having a colony of artists approach has differentiated our films.” Morris is not entirely correct in that statement because Dreamworks also continues to produce many of its films, including Ruby Kraken, in Glendale, but it is true that the production of films like Spider-Man, Super Mario, and TMNT took place in either Canada or France. Studios benefit by producing in other countries not only from cheap labor (like a starting wage of $22.50/hr to animate on Spider-verse), but also foreign tax credits, rebates, and incentives that use other countries’ taxpayer money to fund American productions.

Also, something interesting to take into account: Dreamworks is a unionized shop, while Emeryville-based Pixar isn’t part of The Animation Guild, yet Pixar’s non-unionized production still managed to cost nearly three times as much as a fully-unionized movie like Ruby Gillman. So, while labor is more expensive in California, unionization is not the culprit of higher production costs.

Other studios exclude executive salaries and other costs, while Pixar doesn’t

Morris claimed that another reason Pixar films are reported as more expensive than other studios is because Pixar’s accounting includes certain line items in its budget that other studios exclude. He explained:

The other thing I’ll say about our film budgets is that our whole company exists only to make these films. So when we say a budget, that is everything it takes to run the whole company. Sometimes, the budgets [for other films] that get reported are physical production costs and don’t include the salaries of executives and things like that. Our budgets include all of that, so there’s some accounting context that gets lost. But that doesn’t mean they’re not expensive.

Visual complexity

Though Pixar doesn’t push graphic experimentation in the way that Sony Pictures Animation and other studios have tried to do in the last few years, it doesn’t mean that it’s films are any less visually or technically complex. Elemental, says Morris, was “particularly expensive because all the characters have visual effects.”

In the case of Elemental, the fire and water characters included volumetric simulations, which required a huge deal of processing power. The studio had to ramp up its processing power to a record 151,000 cores (i.e. processing units of the CPU) for the the production of the film, and building supercomputer infrastructure like that isn’t cheap.

Do Pixar films earn enough money to justify their cost?

It depends on the film. Last year’s Lightyear was one of Hollywood’s biggest financial flops, and per independent analysis by Deadline, lost Disney $106M. On the other hand, Elemental started out slowly but has had a highly unconventional box office run and turned profitable. According to Morris, Elemental has turned profitable at the box office alone, not even taking into account all of its other revenue streams: “[A]t the box office we’re looking at now, it should do better than break even theatrically. And then we have revenue from streaming, theme parks and consumer products. This will certainly be a profitable film for the Disney company.”

Will Pixar films ever become cheaper?

“That’s a constant question,” said Morris, who indicated that he is committed to keeping production in California. He also said that prior to Elemental, which cost more because of its technical complexity, “we had been getting the film costs down.” Cutting costs at Pixar is likely imperative for Morris, since Disney CEO Bob Iger said during an earning calls earlier this afternoon that Disney is focused on “reducing … the cost per title” of all its upcoming films.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJ0b29uYnJldy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcGl4YXJzLXByZXNpZGVudC1leHBsYWlucy13aHktdGhlLXN0dWRpb3MtZmlsbS1jb3N0LXNvLW11Y2gtYW5kLWl0cy1ub3QtZm9yLXRoZS1yZWFzb24teW91LXRoaW5rLTIzMTM3NC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 13:09:31+00:00,"'Mutant Mayhem 2' Villain Confirmed, Other Iconic Characters May Also Appear - Inside the Magic",Expect some very familiar faces in 'Mutant Mayhem 2'.,"Which iconic villains will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2?

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is currently entertaining audiences of all ages in movie theaters and has opened to glowing reviews and impressive box office figures ($51.6 million worldwide to date, against a $70 million budget).

The film has an impressive assortment of heroes and villains, but it’s the latter that boasts the most where A-list actors are concerned. There’s Seth Rogen (Bebop), John Cena (Rocksteady), Rose Byrne (Leatherhead), Ice Cube (Superfly), Paul Rudd (Mondo Gecko), and Giancarlo Esposito (Baxter Stockman), to name a few. But with the exception of Bebop and Rocksteady, Mutant Mayhem is missing some major iconic villains.

In an interview with Den of Geek at San Diego Comic-Con, Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe talked about where things might go in the next movie, which, looking at the critical reception for the current film and, more importantly, the box office takings, is inevitable.

“I think a lot of people are gonna want more,” Rowe said. “These characters are so wonderful, this casting is so wonderful, you just love spending time with them. The Turtles’ world is a big one. There’s a lot left to explore. Conversations are happening, and it would be really exciting to let these characters keep on living and breathing.”

One of those conversations is undoubtedly centered around the Turtles’ iconic arch nemesis.

Warning: there are major spoilers ahead for Mutant Mayhem!

During a mid-credits scene, the Ninja Turtles, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), are adjusting to life at Eastman High with their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri).

However, it’s revealed that TCRI head Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who earlier in the film failed to extract the Ninja Turtles’ mutagen-blood to create an army of mutant soldiers, has surveillance on our half-shell heroes. Before the scene ends, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder, who we see standing in the dark near Brooklyn Bridge.

In a recent interview with SFX magazine, when discussing whether or not The Shredder will show up in Mutant Mayhem 2, Rowe jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger), who was missing from the first film in the series, Batman Begins (2005).

Fans hungry for another slice of Ninja Turtles won’t need to wait long, though. Paramount has already greenlit a 2D animated series for Paramount+ later this year, titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2023), that will follow on from Mutant Mayhem, as part of a planned TMNT shared universe.

The mid-credits scene confirms that The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2. He may even show up in the 2D animated series, but it’s likely Nickelodeon will want to save the silver samurai for the silver screen.

While The Shredder is a somewhat exhausted villain, we’ve no doubt that the “Mutant Mayhem-verse” will offer a fresh take on the character, just as the first film has done with its roster of mutants. But which other iconic villains from the wider TMNT universe do we need to see in the sequel?

The Shredder

Many fans would argue that you can’t have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (or show) without The Shredder, the franchise’s most iconic villain. But Oroku Saki was actually killed off in the first volume of the original Mirage Studios comic books in the ’80s.

Be that as it may, the 1987 cartoon series immortalized the character, as he went on to appear in numerous iterations on the small screen, in comic books, video games, and four out of seven of the theatrical movies (not counting Mutant Mayhem‘s mid-credits scene).

Now that we know The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2, it’s high time for something very different. While the Michael Bay-produced 2014 live-action film gave us a “Transformer” version of the character, we’re hoping for something a bit more subtle.

The Foot

You can’t have The Shredder without the Foot (known also as the Foot Clan or the Foot Soldiers). His legion of ninja followers are often depicted as wearing black bodysuits to blend in with the dark, and with large, bug-like eyes on their masks (a bit like Spider-Man).

The Foot are hardly the front and center of TMNT‘s extensive rogues gallery, but they’re just as iconic as The Shredder, largely because they’re so heavily associated with him. Assuming Mutant Mayhem‘s version of The Shredder is a ninja, then the Foot are a no-brainer.

In the mid-credits scene, we only see the side of The Shredder’s helmet, and the spikes on his shoulder pad. He certainly looks like a ninja, but whether or not he’s Oroku Saki remains to be seen. But as Splinter (Jackie Chan) isn’t the Hamato Yoshi version, who shares a history with Saki, it’s unlikely.

Krang

For many fans, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) remains a bit of a mystery. This is understandable, because Mutant Mayhem doesn’t reveal much about her, other than the fact she heads up TCRI, and wants the Turtles’ blood to create super-soldiers.

In the mid-credits scene, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder to help her capture the Turtles now that they’re in high school and surrounded by people, as opposed to living in the shadows. But who is Cynthia Utrom?

Well, we know the word “Utrom” is the name given to Krang’s species — yes, the Krang, from the many cartoons and comic books and live-action movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) — and we know that they love to make mutant armies.

Cynthia Utrom’s human form is probably a robot, with a Krang operating from the inside, who is most likely female, especially when you consider that the mutants Leatherhead (Rose Byrne) and Wingnut (Natasha Demetriou) are female versions of past iterations.

Baxter Stockman

While Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) already appears in Mutant Mayhem’s opening sequence, there’s plenty of room for him to appear in the sequel. The tricky part is that Stockman is (apparently) killed before the opening credits, but he could always show up in a flashback sequence, or some kind video diary footage.

The sequel may even reveal that Superfly (Ice Cube) is the same person as Baxter Stockman. In previous iterations of TMNT, Baxter is Superfly, as part of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like mutation storyline, however, in Mutant Mayhem, both characters are entirely separate. As far as we’re told anyway, as Superfly’s hair looks suspiciously similar to Baxter’s.

Casey Jones

We know what you’re thinking: Casey Jones isn’t a villain. But Mutant Mayhem doesn’t appear to be following the TMNT playbook all that much. For starters, most of its mutant characters were born as animals, such as Superfly, Bebop, and Rocksteady, whereas in previous iterations they are humans who are transformed into mutant animals.

And don’t get us started on all the lore the film completely ignores, from Splinter’s backstory with The Shredder, which seems to have been thrown out of the window, to the fact that the Ninja Turtles end up in high school. A bold and admirable direction, for sure, but loyal to the TMNT mythology this film ain’t. This could work in its favors, though.

Casey Jones, the hockey stick-wielding vigilante, could be introduced a villain, which would create an interesting dynamic between Casey and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and in turn, the Ninja Turtles.

2023-07-03 21:29:28+00:00,"Midsummer Box Office Hitting $1.88 Billion, -2% From 2022","Box Office: Mid-Summer At $1.88 Billion, Led by 'Guardians of the Galaxy'","From left: Summer 2023's top 3 movies to date: 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,' 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' and 'The Little Mermaid'

We’ve had a couple of tentpole missteps here this summer, read Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny this weekend with $60M, The Flash and Elemental; putting the running summer box office at $1.88 billion for May 1-July 2.

That’s close to -2% off from the $1.91 billion reached over the same frame last year. All these figures come from Comscore.

While the pacing isn’t terrible, the overall industry always likes to exceed year-over-year, especially after that disastrous pandemic that forced theaters to close in 2020 through early March 2021. Summer 2020 for the May 1-July 2 period only grossed $47.3M.

Next to the pre-pandemic summer 2019, which was on Viagra and steroids led by Disney/Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Endgame (delivering $416.7M for that May 1-July 2 play period), summer 2023 is 17% behind that midsummer, which accumulated $2.27 billion.

Still, there’s a lot of hope in July with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One set to open to a franchise-record $100M over 5 days, and the Barbie-and-Oppenheimer weekend fueling what could be a near-$200M weekend over July 21-23 for all films.

Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian points out, “The fortunes of the summer can be perceived as rich or fallow depending on which week is being examined and with many weeks and numerous potential high-profile blockbusters on the way in July and August, it’s way too early to characterize the overall summer box office performance as a hit or a miss.”

Even though we’re slightly behind 2022, we could be ahead ultimately, as Dergarabedian says, “August could be the unexpected savior and take the summer out with a bang instead of a whimper as happened last year.” Remember, Sony’s Bullet Train was the last huzzah last summer before studio movies went dry to the post-pandemic logjam in post-production. This August we have marquee fare in Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (August 2), Warner Bros’ The Meg 2 (August 4), Universal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter (August 11), Sony’s Gran Turismo (August 11), Universal’s raunchy R-rated talking-animals comedy Strays (August 18), Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle (August 18) and Sony’s The Equalizer 3 (September 1).

Disney, despite stumbling with Dial of Destiny and Elemental, is leading all studios at the summer box office thus far with an estimated $811M, per Deadline calculations, and from a diverse slate that includes 20th Century Studios fare and tentpoles. That’s more than the combined $620M that Universal and Sony have pulled in for the beach season. Disney is providing a diverse slate of theatrical releases to cinemas post-pandemic, and it’s largely being very good about long windows (none of this 17-days-to-Disney+ stuff); all this despite the beating the studio took for going theatrical day-and-date on their streaming service back in summer 2021 under the CEO Bob Chapek era.

Summer currently reps 42% of the $4.5M running domestic box office cume this year for January 1-July 2. Overall, 2023 is 18% ahead of 2022 and 21% behind 2019.

Currently Disney owns five of the top 10 movies in summer; here is the list for May 1-July 2:

1.) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (Dis) – $354.8M

2.) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Sony) – $339.8M

3.) The Little Mermaid (Dis) – $281M

4.) Fast X (Uni) – $145.4M

5.) Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (Par) – $136.1M

6.) The Flash (WB) – $99.2M

7.) Elemental (Dis) – $88.7M

8.) The Super Mario Bros. Movie (Ill/Uni) – $82.6M (of a total cume that is $573.4M)

9.) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Dis) – $60M

10.) Boogeyman (Dis/20th) – $40.9M",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYm94LW9mZmljZS1zdW1tZXItaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1zcGlkZXJtYW4tbGl0dGxlLW1lcm1haWQtZGlzbmV5LTEyMzU0Mjk1MjMv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXN1bW1lci1pbmRpYW5hLWpvbmVzLXNwaWRlcm1hbi1saXR0bGUtbWVybWFpZC1kaXNuZXktMTIzNTQyOTUyMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-07 07:01:00+00:00,It’s Time to Give Vanilla Ice’s ‘Ninja Rap’ from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II Its Due,"Face it tiger, we’ve got to accept Vanilla Ice dancing with Michelangelo is one of the crowning moments in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles history.","Of course “Ninja Rap” and Secret of the Ooze have been fairly castigated in recent decades as everything silly in kids’ entertainment became hallowed ground in adults’ modern geek culture. Over recent years, that’s meant the admittedly far superior first TMNT movie, 1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, becoming something of a classic. And to be certain, it definitely is the best Ninja Turtles flick ever produced, with Golden Harvest and New Line Cinema being somehow convinced to allow men in Jim Henson suits to flip around the rooftops of Hell Kitchen. As directed by Steve Barron, there’s even a tangible grit to its photography of late ‘80s Manhattan. The Turtles curse, swing swords, and a giant rat named Splinter uses a nunchuck to drop the Shredder off a rooftop.

It’s still a solidly PG children’s entertainment where the villains’ lair is littered with arcade cabinets and a skateboarder’s half-pipe, but the nostalgic romanticization it elicits tends to overlook those details. Just as it overlooks that a talking rat is also shown communicating with the talking turtles by using the power of the Force Ninjitsu to cast astral projections, and that the aforementioned Turtles also love nothing more than skateboarding and eating pizza.

1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has got an edge for a family movie, sure, but Taxi Driver, it ain’t. But its reputation in geekdom skews toward that because of how silly, and ultimately terrible, this franchise became to adult eyes by the time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III rolled around in 1993.

Even so, it’s time to stop lumping Secret of the Ooze in with that third movie because the Turtles didn’t get to use their swords and sais as much as they did in the first film—or that they danced with Vanilla Ice. Hell, it’s because they danced with Vanilla Ice that the sequel has a trace of pop culture relevance to this day, albeit as a two-bit piece of kitsch for the third graders. But then again, that’s who Ninja Turtles has always belonged to, or at least it has ever since that cartoon show with the catchy jingle in 1987.

And on the subject of catchy jingles, “Ninja Rap” has become a pop culture treasure for a reason. It’s even included as an easter egg in this year’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

Onscreen the scene occurs in Secret of the Ooze because in their battle with the evil Foot Clan, plus new scary mutants Tatsu and Rahzar, the Turtles inadvertently bust into a Brooklyn nightclub in the warehouse district where Vanilla Ice and a pair of back-up dancers are bopping in synchronized unity. At a glance the scene appears to have instantly reached maximum levels of early ‘90s cheese… and then not one, but two guys with rat ponytails show up.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RpbWUtZ2l2ZS12YW5pbGxhLWljZS1uaW5qYS1yYXAtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1paS1pdHMtZHVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oppenheimer Crosses Another Major Box Office Milestone,"Oppenheimer box office update: Barbie still No. 1, Christopher Nolan No. 4 director at domestic box office.","Oppenheimer is set to blow past $600 million at the global box office in the latest milestone for Christopher Nolan's epic. Days after reaching the half-billion mark to so far become Nolan's fifth highest-grossing film — behind 2012's The Dark Knight Rises ($1.081 billion), The Dark Knight ($1.006B), Inception ($870.7 million), and Interstellar ($773.8m) — Oppenheimer has accumulated a global haul of $593.5 million. According to Deadline, after adding another $7.7 million on Wednesday from 78 territories, the film will reach the $600 million benchmark Thursday as it rolls out in new overseas markets, including Vietnam (August 11th), South Korea (Aug. 15th), Italy (Aug. 23rd), and China (Aug. 30th).

Oppenheimer's box office performance makes Nolan the fourth highest-grossing director domestically with a still-growing total of $2.3 billion, behind only Steven Spielberg ($4.61 billion), James Cameron ($2.69 billion), and Michael Bay ($2.34 billion). The three-hour, R-rated drama about the birth of the nuclear bomb recently extended its IMAX run — twice — due to popular demand.

Domestically on Wednesday, the billion dollar-grossing Barbie kept the No. 1 spot with an additional $7.35 million ($485.4 million domestic total), with Oppenheimer adding $3.74 million ($241.8 million domestic) and the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem earning $2.75 million to bring its stateside haul to $54.3 million. All three films are certified fresh: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles currently sits at 96% approval from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, ahead of Oppenheimer at 93% and Barbie at 88%.

Still to come this month: Sony's Gran Turismo (Aug. 11th) will be off to a relatively slow start with a projected $15m-$20 million, while Universal's period piece Dracula horror The Last Voyage of the Diameter (Aug. 11th) looks to a bite-sized opening weekend in the $5m-$10 million range, according to Box Office Pro. DC's Blue Beetle (Aug. 18th) is reportedly tracking for a $30 million opening next week as it hits theaters opposite the R-rated talking dog comedy Strays.

Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, leading a starry cast that includes Emily Blunt (A Quiet Place) as Oppenheimer's wife, Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, Matt Damon (AIR) as General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey Jr. (Avengers: Endgame) as Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Oppenheimer also reunites Nolan with his Batman star Gary Oldman as Harry S. Truman and features Florence Pugh (Dune: Part Two) as psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie (Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret) as theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano (Minx) as Robert Serber, and Josh Hartnett (30 Days of Night) as pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbmV3cy9vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi02MDAtbWlsbGlvbi_SAWVodHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vbW92aWVzL2FtcC9uZXdzL29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtbWlsZXN0b25lLWNocmlzdG9waGVyLW5vbGFuLTYwMC1taWxsaW9uLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

From its kinetic and colorful animation to the playful irreverence, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” owes a clear debt to another recent superhero franchise – taking a trip through the Turtle-Verse, if you will. Energetic and sporadically funny, it’s a passable effort to jump-start a comic-book franchise that has enjoyed a long if uneven crawl across the screen.
Created in the 1980s, the Turtles first exploded into TV syndication (remember “Heroes in a Half Shell?” Sure ya do), sporadically returning in various incarnations ever since.
This time the Turtles feel a little half-baked, with the reins have been handed to the prolific producing team of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who share script credit with director Jeff Lowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and two others, with reports there are already plans for a sequel and related series.
Despite Rogen and Goldberg’s harder-edged superhero sensibilities (see Amazon’s “The Boys” for one), “Turtles” clocks in with a PG rating and is mostly appropriate for younger kids. It’s adults, rather, who might find the movie growing tedious, especially during its last third, which tacks on a tired and uninvolving action sequence to pad out the story.
Until then, “Mutant Mayhem” is marginally merry, rehashing the Turtles’ origin story involving the strange green ooze that turned them into talking reptile bipeds, dwelling in the sewer with the rat, Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan), who adopted and raised them.
With actual teenagers providing the voices, the central quartet – Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Raphael (Brady Noon) – engages in lots of savvy pop-culture banter, name-checking everything from “Avengers: Endgame” to BTS. The teen-boy formulations have a goofy charm, if not necessarily representing the kind of material likely to possess a particularly long shelf (or shell) life.
Mostly the Turtles just want to fit in, chafing against the limitations of their subterranean home and lack of social interaction. As a result, they’re practically giddy when they encounter April O’Neil (“The Bear’s” Ayo Edebiri), an outcast who fuels their plan to behave like heroes in order to convince the wider world to stop fearing and hating them.
The opportunity to demonstrate their good intentions comes in the form of another anthropomorphic villain, Superfly (Ice Cube), who is pursuing more violent path toward acceptance. The movie bogs down once he and his minions enter the picture, becoming loud and chaotic in tiresome ways.
Indeed, given Paramount’s grand plans to milk “TMNT” for all it’s worth, the most promising iteration of this variant might be the prospect of a series, since the smart-aleck-y tone lends itself more to small TV bites than a theatrical meal.
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” always sounded like a one-note joke that improbably broke through the pop-culture clutter, and thanks to the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”-esque animation and nostalgia, it might be time for them to emerge again.
The subtitle, however, proves as much a warning as a promise. Because while these mutants deliver their fair share of mirth, that comes with a little too much mayhem for their own good.

Tracking was bullish on Disney’s Haunted Mansion at $30M-$40M before opening, but that was before they knew what Barbenheimer really was. That theme park ride movie opened to $24M, $200K shy of the 2003 version of the film, which did $24.2M (unadjusted for inflation).
Mutant Mayhem, from Nickelodeon and Seth Rogen’s Point Grey, is looking to be the family choice for the long haul into the fall. The movie is tied with Sony’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse as the best reviewed animated features of 2023 at 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and its current audience score is 94%. Props to Paramount: It was the only motion picture studio to brave San Diego Comic-Con sans stars, and it showed off reels of the pic to a near-full house in Hall H.
Warner Bros. has The Meg 2 opening this weekend, industry estimates are in the mid-$20M range. The studio’s Barbie will dominate in its third weekend with around $55M-$60M.
Last weekend during Barbie‘s second frame, she blazed a record final weekend of July of $217M. Last August, Sony’s Bullet Train was the last huzzah before a dead August-into-October, which was left barren of marquee product due to the post-production logjam caused by Covid. This month will be significantly better. The first weekend of August last year did $92M for all movies. Between Meg 2, Barbie, Oppenheimer and Mutant Mayhem alone, this weekend is bound to be well north of $115M.
Barbie led all movies on Tuesday with $15.25M, +2% from Monday, for a running total of $123.2M. She’ll cross the $400M mark on Thursday, the pic’s 14th day in release, faster than the pacing of Top Gun: Maverick and The Super Mario Bros Movie, both of which took 18 days to hit that domestic B.O. benchmark.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtMTIzNTQ1MzEwNy_SAWJodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLTEyMzU0NTMxMDcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 16:00:00+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: Seth Rogen-Produced Toon Reboot’s Look Is Fresher Than Its Script,"Jeff Rowe runs with the loose, hand-finished style he innovated on 'Mitchells vs. the Machines' as latest 'TMNT' leans into their 'Teenage' identities","It started as a joke. Way back in the ’80s, the phenomenon we now call “superhero fatigue” was already a thing, at least among comics afficionados. Frustrated with pulp creators recycling the same old ideas, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird hatched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The idea was to poke fun at how lame mainstream heroes had gotten, but the parody got so popular, it spawned a mini-empire of its own: movies, games, TV series and a whole lotta merch. At a certain point (around the time Michael Bay got involved), the brand got out of hand. Time for a reset.
With “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” Nickelodeon Movies takes the fertile turtle property back to its roots: Tapping “permanent teenager” (as the trailer cleverly dubs the former “Freaks and Geeks” star) Seth Rogen to produce, the toon studio commissioned an animated reboot that focuses on the ooze-boosted vigilantes’ awkward adolescent identities, while giving the franchise a fresh comic-book look.
Behind the scenes, helmer Jeff Rowe takes the loose, pseudo-hand-drawn style of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines” (which he co-directed) and pushes it even further here, such that every frame has a scribbled, street-art aesthetic. It’s a radical choice — in both the strategic and surfer-speak senses of the word — given how same-samey most big-budget computer-animated movies look these days (Pixar’s “Onward,” Netflix’s “The Sea Beast” and DreamWorks’ “Ruby Gillman” may as well have been made by the same studio). And it couldn’t be more different from the darker vibe and photorealistic textures seen in the Turtles’ last two theatrical outing.
Instead of being shredded martial arts pros, the foursome — named, as you know, after Renaissance painters, but barely distinguishable beyond their preference of weapons and eyewear — are presented as endearingly immature and understandably hormonal. They’re teenagers, after all, itching to get out of their shells … and the sewer where they’ve been raised by rodent sensei Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan).
With a welcome dose of self-deprecation, the script by Rowe, Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit recaps the reptiles’ backstory, the waits a beat. “If you think about that, it couldn’t make more sense,” Chan quips, essentially acknowledging that everything about the Turtles’ origins is ridiculous — but that doesn’t mean the movie can’t have a sense of humor about itself. “Mutant Mayhem” can be a blast at times, and exhausting at others, as the four guys jabber on top of each other, as in the movie’s thowaway “bacon, egg and cheese” gag.
The bickering and bonding tickles more than the main story, which involves a mutant fly (Ice Cube) and a handful of other critters we see being experimented upon by mad scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) when the villainous Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) and her stooges from the Techno Cosmic Research Institute burst in. TMNT fans know what the name “Utrom” means, though that twist will have to wait for a sequel or TV spin-off (both of which are coming, per a recent Nick announcement).
For now, the film focuses on the mutant fly, which Stockman’s research swole into a jive-talking blaxploitation hulk who calls himself “Super Fly.” His plan is to mass-produce the ooze and release it into world, turning all creatures into freakazoid versions of themselves. The Turtles intervene, resulting in a singalong (to 4 Non Blondes’ “What’s Going On”) that mutates into a surreal car chase — easily this absurdist comedy’s most memorable scene.
The movie works best when its creators allow themselves to get truly, unapologetically weird. (The fight scenes are pretty awesome as well, mixing the toon’s unusual look with some very dynamic virtual camera moves.) Less effective is the thing that Rogen and Goldberg have made their signature, but which now feels more like shtick: namely, all the “teenage” stuff, which is neither relatable nor especially original.
I’m pretty sure you could ask ChatGPT to write a TMNT script in the style of Seth Rogen and get something just as funny. There’s even one moment, mid-finale, when aspiring reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) glances up at the now-kaiju-sized Super Duper Fly and delivers what should’ve been an epic catchphrase. The five guys credited with the script could have come up with something incredibly original for this moment, but instead, she yells, “Not on my watch!” (a line Rogen himself screamed in “Pineapple Express”).
While members of the Writers Guild of America are on strike, demanding (among other things) protection from AI, here’s a script that was made by human brains in an oddly similar way: It’s wildly original in places, and a recycled glob of tired clichés in others. The film’s unique look raises similar questions of how humans and algorithms work together, suggesting that animators took what the computer rendered and then retouched every frame by hand. In fact, the job almost certainly involved a more complex mix, where people made the judgment calls, but relied on filters and tools to render the result.
In any case, the movie’s mostly just meant to be fun, and that it is, skewing young while giving lifelong fans (including those who grew up on the Turtles) plenty to geek out about. Here, in the year 2023, the underlying IP feels tired, and yet, liberated by Sony’s “Spider-Verse” movies, Rowe and company shake up how studio toons can look. By extending the material’s anarchic spirit to the animation itself, “Mutant Mayhem” sets the course of not just TMNT sequels, but future studio toons as well.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL3Jldmlld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXJldmlldy1zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLTEyMzU2ODAzNzcv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vcmV2aWV3cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmV2aWV3LXNldGgtcm9nZW4tMTIzNTY4MDM3Ny9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie review (2023),There are undeniably strong visuals here and enough creative voice work to make it tolerable on a hot August day when families are looking for an air-conditioned theater for a few hours.,"Yes, it’s another origin story. Despite being the seventh film to feature these characters, Rowe and co-writers Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg go back to the beginning of the TMNT saga, opening with a scientist named Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) creating the infamous ooze that turns ordinary creatures into mutants. When the authorities break into Baxter’s basement lair, the ooze is spilled into the sewers, and the rest is comic book history as a quartet of turtles becomes fast-talking humanoid creatures named Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Raphael (Brady Noon).
Fans of the franchise know that the turtles are nothing without their leader, Splinter (Jackie Chan), a rat who was also transformed by the ooze and became the father to the teenage mutants after teaching them the ninja skills to protect themselves. Splinter is extremely overprotective, ordering the boys to stay away from human beings at all costs or risk being milked by them (don't ask). A flashback reveals that Splinter tried to introduce himself and the turtles to the humans, but they were somewhat understandably terrified. Now they all live underground, as the turtles sneak out to get supplies and wish they could have a normal teenage life beyond the sewers.
Meanwhile, one of Baxter’s experiments responds very differently to the chasm between the human race and the mutants now living underground. Whereas Splinter wants to hide, Superfly (Ice Cube) wants something closer to vengeance. He’s assembled a group of mutants that include Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Rocksteady (John Cena), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Ray Fillet (Post Malone), Bebop (Seth Rogen), and Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd). Throw in Maya Rudolph as a mysterious figure trying to find the turtles and Ayo Edebiri as April, the human being who befriends the turtles and tries to introduce them to the above-ground world, and you have a stellar voice cast. Once Superfly and his cadre of creatures join the action, “Mutant Mayhem” gets exponentially more fun as each great actor is allowed fun voice beats to shine.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 16:00:00+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: Seth Rogen Puts His Comedic Stamp On The Best TMNT Movie Yet,"A Review of the latest film version of a beloved franchise, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg make it fresh.","In a summer where the off-the-boards success of original movies including Barbie and Oppenheimer is all the rage, the seventh-or so feature film iteration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise wasn’t one with great expectations. Except when you read the credit block and discover the co-writers and producers are none other than Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and the director is Jeff Rowe, who most recently was an Oscar nominee for the wildly inventive animated hit The Mitchells vs The Machines.
They have delivered exactly what you might hope they would: a fiendishly clever, funny but appropriately faithful take on a brand that just hasn’t quit since coming into the world as a modest comic book in 1983 from the minds of Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. Their little creation has spawned countless comics, TV series, all those feature films, video games, toys, bedsheets — you name it. Several generations have been weaned on them, especially boys, and now we have a new toon that takes pride in emphasizing the teenage in the title. It also has lots of heart.
Rogen’s and longtime partner Goldberg’s script is heavy on pop culture humor in all the best ways but takes a cue as well from the youth emphasis of the Tom Holland Spider-Man as well as the hit animated versions. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is young to its core, virtually reinventing the concept right down to the casting of the voice actors in the four title roles.
Fans will not be disappointed with any of the decisions here, notably the scattershot animation that feels rough around the edges, stylish, visually surprising and satisfying and anti-CGI blandness. The producers said they were going for a look that a high school student might have drawn for fun in their notebook. It is all on the screen here thanks to Owen, his co-director Kyler Spears, production designer Yashar Kassai and the talented team of animators, particularly the character department.
Storywise, the screenplay written by Rogen, Goldberg and Jeff Rowe, Dan Hernandez & Benji Samit finds New York is being terrorized by criminal mastermind Superfly (voiced ferociously by Ice Cube), one of many mutant creatures determined to end humans any way he can. He plans to do it with his crew — characters that will be familiar to TMNT fans everywhere — including Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Ray Fillet (Post Malone hilariously singing his name), Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou) and Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress). Good buddy Be Bop, the mutated Warthog, is voiced by Rogen, and it isn’t his first rodeo as that particular creature (remember Pumbaa in The Lion King?), and Rock Steady gets life from John Cena.
The plot revolves around TMNT veteran April O’Neil (The Bear Emmy nominee Ayo Edebiri), the reporter in previous versions who here has been aged down considerably to also being a teen with high ambition to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. She gets her chance when she encounters the TMNT quartet, who have been sheltered by adoptive father Splinter (voiced by the great Jackie Chan), the mutated rat who befriended them when they were toddlers and who were the only ones who liked the rat. Oozed into the sewer, they all live down there munching on their beloved pizza but are taught to distrust and hate humans. In April, though, they find one they like, and her plan is to use them to seek out Superfly, do him in and become the basis for a major news scoop that will catapult her — and them — to glory.
This all does lead to the Ninja Turtles’ encounter with Superfly and his gang. The villain actually takes a liking to them at first, thinking that since they became mutants at about the same period 15 years earlier (where the film begins its pre-credits sequence) they actually are cousins. Soon, though, Superfly’s true intentions and dark side takes over, and the battle is on.
I have to say I found this version of the Turtles to be irresistible, each one very specifically and distinctly drawn and voiced with excellent work from the young actors including Nicolas Cantu (The Fabelmans) as natural leader Leonardo, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Brady Noon as Raphael and Micah Abbey as Donatello. Losing some of the bulk and imposing look of some of the past creations of this foursome, they are all truly believable as excited teens looking to find their way in a world they are just beginning to experience.
Rogen has made his mark on a franchise that still finds new ways to smartly entertain amid all that mayhem.

2023-08-07 19:42:30+00:00,"Seth Rogen Did Not Want ‘TMNT’ Animators Overworked and Suffering, Told Director That Work Should Not ‘Become Their Entire Lives’","Seth Rogen inspired ""Mutant Mayhem"" director Jeff Rowe to treat the film's animators ""ethically.""","A Vulture report published in June claimed that animators on Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” were extremely overworked during production. The report followed similar claims made by several visual effects workers about the brutal working conditions at Marvel Studios. For Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” it appears director Jeff Rowe wanted to buck this problematic trend. He recently told Insider that producer Seth Rogen helped him ensure that animators on the film were not overworked and suffering.
“That was the thing that was really important to us on this film, and I learned it from Seth and Evan because in getting to know Seth, I’m like, ‘He has a really good work-life balance and everyone at Point Gray does,'” Rowe said, referring to Rogen’s production company. “And I asked him about that and he is like, ‘Well, when you’re doing live action, sometimes you’re on a set for 40 days in a row and it is exhausting and tiring. And we want to make sure that our people have time away from that and that it doesn’t become their entire lives.'”
“I really took that to heart and wanted to make sure that when we made this film, we did it ethically,” Rowe continued, noting that he got feedback directly from the film’s animators about what would make them most comfortable. Some of them wanted to work “three days a week,” for instance, while others asked to work remotely.
“We’d be like, ‘Great, let’s figure that out, and let’s accommodate that because that’s your process and that’s what leads you to make your best art,'” Rowe said. “And we would often do that with most of the team and just try to make sure everyone always felt supported. I never want the team to be suffering more than I am. And I also hopefully am suffering more than the team because I’m the captain and I’m paid to absorb that, and they’re not. It’s important to preserve that. People just do better work when they’re rested and have home lives.”
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” pulled in a solid $28 million during its opening weekend. The film opened on a Wednesday and earned a five-day gross of $43 million. With a $70 million production budget, the film is far cheaper than Pixar’s $200 million-budgeted “Elemental” and Sony’s $100 million-budgeted “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvc2V0aC1yb2dlbi10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWFuaW1hdG9ycy1vdmVyd29ya2VkLXN1ZmZlcmluZy0xMjM1Njg5NzI2L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3Mvc2V0aC1yb2dlbi10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLWFuaW1hdG9ycy1vdmVyd29ya2VkLXN1ZmZlcmluZy0xMjM1Njg5NzI2L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 10:00:00-04:00,Seth Rogen did Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Marvel scares him,"Seth Rogen, producer behind The Boys, Invincible, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, plans to stay far away from the Marvel and DC universes.","What does this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie have in common with 2011’s oddball superhero flick The Green Hornet? A name: Seth Rogen.
And while that might not seem like a feather in Mutant Mayhem’s cap, all the other Seth Rogen-produced comic book adaptations between the two do: There’s Preacher, The Boys, and Invincible, with more seasons and spinoffs of the latter two on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem looks to follow that streak.
The four wisecracking, pizza-scarfing turtles have featured in cartoon shows, movies, and toys for so long that it’s easy for their comic book origins to be eclipsed. In 1983, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird assembled their lightly parodic comics series from bits of every blockbuster superhero comic of the time: the teenagers of New Mutants and New Teen Titans; the mutants of the X-Men; and above all, Frank Miller’s Daredevil, from which they borrowed ninjas and martial arts, an origin story involving weird chemicals, a mentor named after a piece of wood, and a faceless horde of bad guys named after a bodily extremity.
Their self-published comic was the kind of sales and licensing success that rocked an industry still stretching its muscles from decades of publishing consolidation. So it’s not merely that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are an evergreen brand — they’re also a shoo-in for Rogen, who has quietly made a second career of racking up hugely successful comic book adaptations not based on Warner Bros. or Disney properties.
Polygon sat down to chat with Rogen in anticipation of the film, which he co-wrote and executive-produced (and for which he recorded the voice of Bebop), and which features the work of director Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and a cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Giancarlo Esposito. Paramount has already announced development on a sequel and a Paramount Plus TV spinoff, making Mutant Mayhem the dawn of a new era of the ever-mutating franchise.
[Ed. note: This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike against the AMPTP went into effect.]
Polygon: My favorite way to talk about TMNT’s arc from comics to a transmedia franchise is to point out that it started with making puns about Daredevil. What do you think it is about this really unique comic about altered reptile karate kids that keeps capturing different generations’ hearts and minds?
Seth Rogen: Someone smart once said all the best ideas start as jokes. And I think that this firmly falls into that category. It started as a way for two comic book writers to make each other laugh, literally. They were they were doodling in their sketchbooks, trying to crack each other up, and that’s where the first images of this came from.
But, like great writers, they imbued it with something that is undeniably relatable and resonant, which is the teenage part. That word is what makes it go from being a silly thing that is disposable, to something that weirdly has resonated with people for 40 years. It’s because they’re teenagers, and they feel this desire to be a part of the normal world, and this desire to be understood, and that they’re fun and kind of reckless and immature. That is really the thing that has made them resonate for so long. To me, it’s the thing that I thought was also the most underexplored. But it started, literally, as a comic book, and then became a Saturday morning cartoon and became toys — a lot of toys.
And I loved the toys. The toys themselves honestly had so much creativity put into them, and so many weird details and artistic elements. Something me and Jeff [Rowe] always talk about is how the Mondo Gecko toy — his tail had a roller skate tied to it, suggesting that [laughs] it was too heavy for him to drag around and so he, like, thought to put a roller skate on it to roll it around behind him. Little things like that were so imaginative, and they really have stuck in my head for 35 years.
And then the movies! I skateboarded because of the Ninja Turtles, and I did karate — it really tapped into a lot of things that were really popular in the ’80s, and ’90s as well. I felt like I was constantly the recipient of their goals; everything they were trying to do was really landing on me.
You’re quietly one of the biggest producers of indie comics adaptations in Hollywood. Preacher, The Boys, Invincible, and going back to The Green Hornet. How do you define your taste in comics? What kind of comic is the comic that grips you so hard that you go, Yeah, I think I want to make this my job for a year?
Well, first of all, it’s everything that is not Marvel and DC. [laughs] So that eliminates a lot right away. I grew up going to comic book shops, and it’s funny, video stores are making a slight comeback in some ways. This idea of browsing and not having things fed to you — as I think people feel we are now when it comes to entertainment — but instead entering the fair market of entertainment and just wandering around and seeing what catches your eye.
That’s what I always did with comic books; I would go to the comic book shop and I would just walk around. And you see this comic book and it catches your eye, and you see that comic book and it catches your eye. Those have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?
Like, I love Akira — what am I going to add to Akira? Things like that, where it’s out, and it’s good, it’s a movie and it exists. That’s something we think of also. For [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem], honestly [co-writer Evan Goldberg and I] felt like there was an unexplored facet, and as people who have written a lot of teenage films and have been cinematically linked to that genre a lot over the years, we were like, Oh, like, that’s totally different for this, is if we do a teenage version of it. A lot of it is just thinking, Could we bring this to life well and do it in a way that, as fans of it, we wouldn’t be annoyed with ourselves if we were watching it from the outside?
What has turned you off from Marvel and DC?
Honestly, probably fear. [laughs] We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.
It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with? And what’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this. So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!
Working on those bigger-budget, bigger-scope projects can be a real beast, and so can animated films. Are there specific lessons that you took from them for Mutant Mayhem?
I approach them very similarly. That’s something that I realized I used to think was a bug, and now I think it’s a feature. [laughs] A lot of people who make animated movies really approach them like animated movies, and they are constantly, from a writing standpoint, thinking of how to use the medium of animation, in the cutting pattern, in the scene patterns and all that. I’m firmly from the live-action world and so I very much write in the style of a live-action movie.
To me, I’m trying to bring what I would consider a traditional cinematic sensibility to the structure and the flow and how the scenes are, and not play too much into the medium in that way. And then to give the whole thing a look that is just, like, insane, was really a fun way to shade the whole thing.
It was unexpected to me, and I was honestly a little worried at what a big swing the look was at first. But the more I saw of it, I just started to get more and more excited about, and then started writing towards it, and thinking, OK, we have this crazy look. What do I want to see executed in this look? [laughs] What would be fun to watch?
Do you have comics on your bucket list for adaptation? Or, alternatively, what comics are you reading these days that you can’t put down?
That’s a good question. What have I been reading? I read old comics, from time to time. There’s these Green Lantern comics I’ve been reading, I love all those Grant Morrison Superman ones, I was rereading those because I heard that that’s what the James Gunn Superman movie was gonna be inspired by. I read them when they first came out, but I feel like I was distracted, so I went back.
Are there any that I wish we could make or adapt? Every once in a while? Yeah, those Grant Morrison ones are really appealing. We3 is something I’m a big fan of. It seems maybe just too sad honestly; it just bummed me out.
[Ed. note: We3 is a comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely about a trio of weaponized cyborg-animal hybrids. It’s infamous for its extreme violence and extreme pathos.]
We’ve kind of been down that road — and we know Grant a little bit, we’ve talked to him. That’s what’s nice, is we’ve done well with things that were traditionally considered unmakeable, essentially, for a long time. But also we don’t want to ruin things we love. So we’ll have very honest conversations with Grant and just talk about it and where his head’s at, and where our heads are at. Things like We3, we’ve talked to him about several times over the years.

,"Paramount greenlights sequel, spinoff series for 'TMNT: Mutant Mayhem'","'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' doesn't hit theaters until Aug. 2, but Paramount has already announced both a sequel film and spinoff TV series for Paramount+.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem doesn't hit theaters until next month, but Paramount is clearly confident about its new spin on the franchise.
The studio announced Wednesday that they are already working on both a sequel film and a spinoff TV series for Paramount+.

Mutant Mayhem stars Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon as Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael, respectively. The Turtles actually act like teenagers in this film, and are eager to leave their sheltered life with Splinter (Jackie Chan) in order to experience the human world. They soon team up with plucky high school newspaper reporter April O'Neil (The Bear's Ayo Edebiri) to uncover the culprit behind a string of mysterious crimes.
All four Turtles actors are set to reprise their roles for the TV series, which will bridge the gap between the first and second films. The premise of the series finds the four brothers each trying to make it on their own.
""Faced with new threats and teaming up with old allies, the Turtles will discover who they really are when they don't have their brothers at their sides,"" according to Paramount.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hits theaters on Aug. 2. The star-studded voice cast also includes John Cena, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, Post Malone, Hannibal Buress, Maya Rudolph, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rogen himself, among others.

,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem: Release Date, Trailers, Cast & More","We break down the characters, the voice cast, the plot, the release date, and more.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been a pretty consistent part of the pop culture landscape since Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s scrappy self-published comic became a sensation in the mid-1980s, spawning an iconic animated series and a popular toy line. In the years since, that initial spark of creativity has inspired several distinct animated universes, two live-action film series, a bevy of toys, multiple video games, mountains of comics, and at least one rock music tour.
With all of that in mind, we’re getting a brand new version of the plucky amphibian heroes in the form of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which looks to stoke the fires of 1980s nostalgia and introduce the Turtles to a new generation. If the previews released so far are anything to go by, the film appears to strike the right chords for older TMNT fans while also appealing to their children and – in some cases – grandchildren. Let’s head to the sewers and dredge up everything we know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

Starting afresh – as opposed to continuing one of the existing film or TV continuities – the film sees the Turtles, after years of seclusion and training, making their way to the surface in the hopes of being embraced by humanity. Befriending April O’Neil (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), the team takes on a reclusive crime syndicate to keep the streets and sewers safe. And, maybe, they’ll find the acceptance they crave along the way.
Some fans may notice the absence of certain details – notably the Foot Clan and the ever-present Turtles nemesis Shredder – but the presence of characters like Bebop (Seth Rogen) and Rocksteady (John Cena) suggests those TMNT staples will appear in due course. See also: Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who often appears in Turtles stories as a press-ganged scientist aiding the Foot in the creation of their own mutants. Although, just as often, he willingly helps as it furthers his own aims and research in mutation.
And, as it happens, other mutants will quickly become a cause of concern for the Turtles. Will they be friends or foes? Considering the film is subtitled Mutant Mayhem, expect that question to drive some of the action.

Naturally enough, the Turtles inhabit New York. But judging from our first glimpses at the film, it is a stylized New York one might expect Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Miles Morales to visit. Indeed, the art direction was one of the big appeals for long-time fans when a teaser first arrived in March. Distinct from previous iterations of the Turtles, it also feels like a natural path for the comic book-inspired film.
Beyond that, the swift introduction of alien worlds (and aliens) in the original Eastman and Laird comics and the first animated series means there is always room for the Turtles to visit locations less grounded than Manhattan.

Eschewing the typical pattern for the Turtles voice cast – or even long-time voice actors like Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, or Greg Cipes – the film will feature four actual teenagers in the lead roles. The Walking Dead: World Beyond‘s Nicolas Cantu leads as Leonardo, the most dedicated of Master Splinter’s pupils to their training and goals. Micah Abbey lends his voice to generally tech-smart Donatello. Brady Noon of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers brings the attitude as a new Raphael, while Shamon Brown Jr. parties it up as Michelangelo.
Of course, we’re assuming the personalities of the Turtles will remain intact in Mutant Mayhem, but as seen in the teaser trailer, casting a group of young men leads to a noticeably different interpretation of the characters – vocally, at least. Additionally, the group recorded their dialogue together, offering a chance for more improvisation and a greater sense of camaraderie, which we clearly see in the scene of the Turtles goofing off in the teaser.
Beyond the four leads, the film is outfitted with a surprising number of familiar names – many of them playing surprising character pulls from Turtles history. Starting with the most recognizable characters, The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri lends her voice to this version of April O’Neil. The character has had many permutations over the years, from TV anchor to budding reporter to straight-up ninja, so anything is possible with Edebiri and her take on the Turtles’ most constant friend. Jackie Chan takes on the role of Master Splinter, the boys’ sensei and adoptive father.

As mentioned above, the recognizable bad guys include Bebop and Rocksteady, voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena, respectively, and Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman. Will the latter end up a fly by the end of the film? Time will tell.
Paul Rudd offers his talents as Mondo Gecko, the radical skateboarding lizard who has been part of TMNT lore since 1989. Rose Byrne plays Leatherhead, a mutant alligator who has been both friend and foe to the Turtles over the years. Post Malone voices Ray Fillet, a character who first appeared in the Archie Comics Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series as “Man-Ray” but soon made his way to the action figure aisles under his subsequent moniker. Hannibal Buress becomes Genghis Frog, one of the original toy line’s attempts at beating imitators to the punch with a group known as the Punk Frogs. Natasia Demetriou takes on Wingnut, a humanoid bat who is sometimes an alien, a mutant, a would-be superhero, or a terrorist, depending on the era and series. Maya Rudolph is Cynthia Utrom – a character who might seem new for the film, but with a last name that fans will certainly recognize and that suggests something very specific about who she might truly be.

And finally, Ice Cube is Superfly, a new addition to the group of mutants to be featured in the film, who is revealed to be the primary villain in the latest trailer. Taking a page out of X-Men nemesis Magneto’s playbook, Superfly asserts that humans will never accept mutants like him and his cohorts, so he’s out to conquer mankind and put mutants in charge. Bebop, Rocksteady, and the others accordingly appear to be on his side.
While all the other mutants certainly pull at the nostalgia strings, the new direction in casting the Turtles voices may be the key thing that opens the characters up to a new generation of fans.

The film is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe, co-director of The Mitchells vs The Machines – which he also wrote – and a staff writer on Gravity Falls and Disenchantment. Joining him as co-director is Kyler Spears, who also worked on Mitchells as a storyboard artist; considering their past collaboration, it’s no surprise that Mutant Mayhem feels like the next step in the evolution of the visual style we saw in Mitchells. Rowe also wrote Mutant Mayhem in conjunction with Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit.
According to Rogen, part of the intent is to lean into the “Teenage” aspect of the title more heavily than in past iterations, citing movies like Stand By Me as inspiration. Based on the teaser, it definitely appears his intent made it to the finished product.
Rogen and Goldberg serve as producers with Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean as executive producers. Other crew include procution designer Yashar Kassai, character designer James A. Castillo, production supervisor Derek Manzella, and post-production supervisor Ryan Price.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opens on August 2, 2023. It’s unclear if the intent is to launch a new wave of TMNT movies, but if the film is a success, it’s likely that fans will have plenty more to be excited for in the future of the franchise.

2023-08-01 19:59:00+00:00,How a call from Seth Rogen convinced Ice Cube to join Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,All it took was one sentence to get the actor/singer on board with the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles project.,"Editor’s note: All interviews for this story were conducted prior to the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike.
How much convincing did it take for Ice Cube to sign on to the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem project?
“One sentence,” Ice Cube said with a smile. “It was like Seth [Rogen] calling me, ‘Hey, Cube! I’m doing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, man. I’ve got a character for you.'”
That character is the movie’s big bad guy, Superfly. As you’d expect, Superfly is just that: a fly. He leads an army of mutants — featuring the voice talents of Paul Rudd, Post Malone, Hannibal Burress, John Cena and Rogen — that go head-to-head with everyone’s favorite heroes in a half shell.

See it in theatres everywhere Wednesday, August 2, Sneak Previews start early in select theatres this Saturday, July 29. https://t.co/ysUtySWkv1 pic.twitter.com/Lnl6PCJWk0 — TMNT (@TMNTMovie) July 27, 2023
Early returns from sneak previews over the weekend indicate that the movie is headed for success. As of August 1, Mutant Mayhem sits at 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with 74 reviews.
“It was a no brainer,” Ice Cube said. “I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It’s like being drafted on a winning championship team dynasty. You would be a fool to turn this down.”
From the jump, Ice Cube connected with Superfly, even if the drawing didn’t quite match up with what he had in mind. “I thought when [Seth Rogen] said Superfly, I thought it was pimp hat. I thought it was Cadillac, and then he sent me to picture, and I’m like, ‘Oh, damn, he is a super ugly fly.’ I knew I could make him cool and make him the kingpin that he is running New York and causing mayhem.”
Ice Cube is not new to acting, having starred in roles from Friday (1995) to Anaconda (1997) to 21 Jump Street (2014) and many in between. He’s also an old pro in the recording studio, including his work on N.W.A.’s Straight Outta Compton (1988), It Was a Good Day (1992) and You Can Do It (2007).
But acting in the studio? That’s a bit of a different beast. One that Ice Cube enjoyed immensely. “I just went in the booth, put on my cape like I usually do like. In hip hop you’re in there by yourself most of the time anyway,” Cube explained. “What was cool is he had us working together. So, I was working directly with the turtles. And you know, it made for better voiceovers and better interaction.”

2023-07-16 16:10:00+00:00,Why ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Got a Makeover With Brand New CG Animation Style,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ offers a new look at the iconic turtle heroes thanks to CG animation.,"We’ve never been really far away from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Since they first arrived as comic book characters in the early 1980s, there has been a steady supply of comics, TV shows, games and films that celebrate the canon of Cowabunga. And TMNT fandom, once experienced, can almost never be forgotten. Is it the masks? The pizza? The ooze that made them who they are? It’s nearly impossible to single one thing out.
When lifelong Turtle enthusiasts Seth Rogen, Jeff Rowe and Evan Goldberg started working on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which arrives in theaters this August, they knew they wanted to update the characters for a new generation while also telling a relevant story. They were also interested in using a CG animation style that looked less than perfect and would remind audiences of their own doodles they might have done in a notebook while listening to a boring class lecture in high school.
“I think for us, artistically, it was a reaction to a 30-year trend in 3D CG animation to push towards photorealism and hyper-realistic lighting and texturing,” says writer-director Rowe, who also co-directed “The Mitchells vs. the Machines.” “Then, a few years ago, ‘(Spider-Man:) Into the Spider-Verse’ happened, and that showed that a movie can look like the concept artwork and can be critically and financially successful. That opened a lot of doors and I think we tried to take that football and run with it on ‘Mitchells,’ and then on ‘Turtles,’ I tried to be even less compromising. We decided we wanted this movie to look exactly like a concept artwork, and we want the concept artwork to feel distinctly human and not computer-generated. And that means sketchy and imperfect and misshapen and reminiscent of the way you draw when you’re a child or a teenager, and your passion and enthusiasm for making art hasn’t been dimmed by formal art training. It’s the kind of drawing you do before you have that voice in your head that says, ‘Don’t do that. That’s not how you draw.’ We wanted to design a film that had that level of unfettered expression. And then it was just a lot of designing it and convincing a lot of really talented artists that it was OK to make mistakes, and that those were actually features not bugs.”
Production designer Yashar Kassai found working out the sketchy, unfinished style one of the most difficult parts of the production as well.
“The thing that felt so wrong in the beginning was telling my very highly trained, skillful artists who are also ultra-talented that, because we’re drawing like teenagers, I need you to draw that again but I need you to peel away all those years you spent in art school learning your craft and draw like your 15-year-old self,” says Kassai. “But once everyone relinquished the conventional design wisdom of animation, we had a lot of fun.”
This emotionally authentic style of animation fell in line with the story they wanted to tell with TMNT — a coming-of-age origin story about teenagers who experience feelings of isolation, loneliness and awkwardness as they try to find themselves. Plus, they’re mutants and turtles.
During Rowe’s first meetings Rogen and Goldberg, they talked about bringing tears to the eyes of viewers “when they leave this movie. “Being a teenager is inherently an emotional, confusing, lonely time in your life. There’s so much feeling in making these characters real teenagers and we committed to having them voiced by teenagers.”
The voice cast includes Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael, Micah Abbey as Donatello and Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo. In the non-teenager roles, an equally notable group of actors appear: Rogen voices a mutant animal named Bebop, Jackie Chan is Master Splinter, John Cena is Rocksteady, Ice Cube plays the villainous Superfly and Maya Rudolph is the mysterious Cynthia Utrom.
The over-21 cast also voices mutants. And those mutants are some of the most unusual and bizarre you might see in a mainstream animation feature.
“Our Holy Grail of the entire franchise has always been the late ’80s cartoon, the original series, and that really wacky toy line that came out during the early ’90s,” says Kassai. “We were looking back to the time when sophomoric gross-out humor was the comedic style of the day. So we started there, but then we added the teenage drawing aspect on top of it as a very strong top layer. We were also heavily inspired by films like ‘Chungking Express.’ The Turtles are hiding from humans so it all takes place at night, and these kids have to hide in the shadows because they want to be a part of human society but they feel kind of unsafe when they’re around humans because of what their dad has told them about humans. So they cannot be like on a sunlit beach or on a sunny day in, like, Central Park. We spent a lot of time diversifying what New York at nighttime looks like and giving it a variety of different color schemes.”
For Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation and Paramount Animation, it was important to find the right creative team to take on TMNT. This team would be working with one of the most beloved animation franchises and reaching out to a new generation of potential fans who may have not even been born when the first TV shows and films were created.
“I think it’s an animation masterpiece and just hilarious and Seth and his team are such a big part of that,” says Naito. “It’s a good example of creators coming in to reimagine something that they love. I remember coming back to Nickelodeon and talking about TMNT and we knew the team who worked on it had to be creators who loved TMNT.”
Brian Robbins, president and CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, “and I both thought about Seth Rogen, and when we called him about it he loved it, he grew up with the characters. From there, we brought in Jeff Rowe, who also grew up with the Turtles and it was his dream for him to come and work on Turtles and to work with Seth. I think that love is really seen on the screen.”
For Goldberg, the appeal started early and never waned. He hopes their take on the characters will be relatable through their real, universal struggles.
“They are mutants, they are ninjas, and they are awesome-looking,” says Goldberg. “Overall, though, it is a story about a father and his four brothers who are very different, argue and disagree, but they are a family who are always there for each other. They are doing what they can to make the world a better place and that is what we should be doing. No matter your race, religion, or what type of mutated human-animal hybrid you are, you should be there for your family and do what you can to make the world rad. In a way, we are all Turtles, metaphorically speaking.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2ZvY3VzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1hbmltYXRpb24tMTIzNTY2NjU0MS_SAWhodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9mb2N1cy90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tYW5pbWF0aW9uLTEyMzU2NjY1NDEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Even though it is Barbie’s world yet again for another weekend as it inches closer to $1 billion worldwide, four turtles are chilling for the no. 2 spot at the box office. According to Variety, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem earned $10.2 million on opening day, a.k.a. enough money for, like, 833,000 pizzas which would last probably a month in the sewers of NYC. Produced and co-written by Seth Rogen, the movie follows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo (who are all voiced by real teens) in their, wait for it, teenage antics, as Rogen wanted to emphasize the “teen” in TMNT, especially due to his start with shows like Freaks and Geeks and movies like Superbad. The turtle flick is expected to earn around $35 million to $45 million over the five-day opening, which isn’t bad against its $70 million budget.

2023-08-03 15:46:19.733000+00:00,Mutant Mayhem is a grody and gorgeous reintroduction to the TMNT,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem knocks it out of the park with a straightforward story elevated by phenomenally inspired art direction and sharp action.,"There has seldom been a moment during the past 20 years when there wasn’t a relatively new spin on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles airing on TV, playing in movie theaters, or appearing in comic books, which is part of what made director Jeff Rowe’s Mutant Mayhem animated feature such a curious surprise when it was first announced. With there being so many different modern takes on the characters first created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, it wasn’t all that clear what more that could be done with them that 4Kids, Warner Bros., Nickelodeon, and parent company Paramount hadn’t already tried multiple times over.
Narratively, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is such a classic and straightforward Turtle tale that it’ll ring almost too familiar to anyone who knows the heroes in a half shell — especially those who’ve kept up with the franchise over the past couple of years. But between the movie’s delightfully grimy art direction, its hyper-kinetic action sequences, and its quintet of strong, pointedly youthful lead performances, Mutant Mayhem is also hands down one of the most exciting and definitive outings the Ninja Turtles have ever had.
Set largely in the slime-filled sewers of New York City, Mutant Mayhem tells the slightly updated story of how Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) grew up to become pizza-munching, anthropomorphic, reptilian crime fighters after being exposed to mutagenic ooze as ordinary baby turtles.

After years of living in secret and being raised by their similarly mutated adoptive rat-turned-father figure, Splinter (Jackie Chan), the boys all know just how dangerous the surface and the humans who call it home can be for people who aren’t considered “normal.” But as teenage boys who’ve spent their entire lives being forced to hide in the shadows and made to practice their ninjutsu arts strictly for self-defense, the brothers can’t help but be curious about the bright, bustling world above that’s always been just out of their reach.
Almost all of the early beats in Mutant Mayhem’s script from Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit feel like the movie checking off a list of TMNT basics for newcomers. But it breezes through them with a swift and stylish precision that telegraphs Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears’ razor-sharp sense for crafting the bigger, busier action sequences that come later on and brilliantly showcases Arthur Fong and Tiffany Lam Almack’s absolutely stunning art direction.
While the Ninja Turtles have been varying degrees of cute, “cool,” and alarming, throughout their almost 40-year-long history, there’s always been an innate ick factor to them that’s a big part of their appeal. Mutant Mayhem’s Turtles are still a gaggle of sewer-dwelling teenage boys who don’t clean behind their ears because they’re not entirely sure if they have them. But one of Mutant Mayhem’s most brilliant moves is the way it parlays the TMNT brand’s classic grossness into a more expansive grotesque aesthetic that defines the entire world around the Turtles, but — interestingly — not the Turtles themselves.
Unlike the Turtles, who — despite being unique in small ways — all share a recognizable symmetrical wholeness, basically every single human who appears in Mutant Mayhem is rendered as a kind of artfully bizarre nightmare person whose faces all feel like reflections of the city (and humanity’s) ugliness. It’s as true of the innocent strangers the Turtles sneak by during their bodega runs as it is of ​​Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) — the villainous head of the research lab desperately trying to replicate the process that led to the mutagenic ooze’s creation. But it’s not at all the case with high school student April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), whose chance encounter with the Turtles one evening gives them all hope that they might finally have a shot at making some real new friends.

Occasionally, Mutant Mayhem might feel a bit too packed with pop culture and brand references for its own good — particularly to older theatergoers who lived through previous corporate marketing blitzes designed to turn people into lifelong Turtles fans. But everything about Mutant Mayhem’s quippy sense of humor, its scribbly / sketchy visual language, and its focus on the Turtles’ obsession with the surface is meant to remind you that — in addition to being mutant ninjas — they’re a bunch of goofy kids that actual children are meant to be able to relate to in an organic way.
It’s exactly the sort of vibe that a reboot meant to kick off a new era of films and spinoff series should have, and while it remains to be seen whether Paramount can really keep this momentum going long term, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the studio’s absolutely knocked it out of the park.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgxNzI5Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

TMNT: Mutant Mayhem follows younger versions of the turtle quartet as they try to gain popularity among their fellow New Yorkers by putting a stop to the villainous Superfly’s crime wave. The animated film includes a star-studded cast of Hollywood actors in supporting roles including Rogen as Bebop, Ice Cube as Superfly, John Cena as Rocksteady, and action-movie legend Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, to name a few.

Speaking with Empire Magazine, Rogen revealed that his fanboy-related TMNT injury came soon after his father gifted him his pair of nunchucks.

“Part of the reason I did karate was because of the Ninja Turtles,” Rogen said. “Me and [co-writer Evan Goldberg] both did karate together. My dad got me nunchucks that I cracked my head open with, because I was obsessed with the Ninja Turtles, and Michelangelo specifically.”

Goldberg added to Rogen’s painful recountings of his ninja faux pas, divulging that it was more than Rogen’s head that the comedy actor broke when displaying his nunchuck skills, saying “Seth had just got these nunchucks. He was like, ‘Yo, check this out, I want to show you this awesome move,’ and just immediately shattered a huge chandelier from his parents’ house into a billion pieces. It took us, like, five hours to clean. On a sitcom, you’d be like, ‘This is too broad.’”
“It was instantaneous,” Rogen added. “It was as though what I was trying to show him was my ability to destroy a lamp.”

In retrospect, it’s probably best that Rogen fancied Mikey instead of Leonardo or Raphael. One could only imagine the kind of physical and property damage a kid could do if left unattended in a house with twin katana or two sais.

That changes in the first clip from next month’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Here, you can instantly tell why this movie was made and what sets it apart. Oh, sure, we’ve seen the Turtles be goofy. We’ve seen them be tough. We’ve seen them in animation, live-action, CGI, you name it. But Mutant Mayhem does something none of those movies have ever done. It lets the characters actually be teenagers. You’ll see what we mean when you watch this awesome, hilarious first clip from the film.

The turtles are voiced by actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon, who recorded much of their dialogue in the same room. And you get that vibe here. It just has a different, more energetic feeling than the previous Turtles movies. Plus, as you can tell, it’s as referential and funny as you’d hope.

“I was like, ‘I’m going to do my best Eric Bana.’ This is an homage to Eric,” Byrne continues. “It was a group recording, and I’d never done that before for a voice job. Seth was there, and he had such high energy from beginning to end. There’s ‘Mayhem’ in the title, and it was like mayhem. Not in a bad way. It was fun mayhem.”
Byrne joked that her many collaborations with Rogen, which include the 2014 comedy “Neighbors” and Apple TV+’s “Platonic,” don’t have her husband, Bobby Cannavale, worried. “He’s our biggest cheerleader,” she says. “He totally gets it. He’s like, ‘You’re so different and it just works.’ It’s really cute.”
Variety exclusively reported that Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies are developing a sequel to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” as well as a two-season series that will serve as a “bridge” between the films. The spinoff series, titled “Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” will be streamed on Paramount+.
The sequel will be produced by Point Grey Pictures and directed by Jeff Rowe, who is also the director and co-writer of “Mutant Mayhem.” Point Grey Pictures is also producing the Paramount+ series. Chris Yost (“Secret Headquarters,” “The Mandalorian,” “Thor: Ragnorok”) and Alan Wan (“Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” [2012 Series]) will be serving as executive producers and showrunners.

2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.
Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.
Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.
Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.
The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”
Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.
Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”
There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.
On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).
Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.
Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.
Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)
“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

2023-08-14 13:26:11+00:00,The New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Feels Surprisingly Jewish – Kveller,,"Warning: spoilers for “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and slightly embarrassing geekiness ahead.
When I grew watching “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” in Israel (imagine saying “Cowabunga” with a Hebrew accent), I never anticipated that the franchise would be the source of future parenting lessons, and yet, here we are.
I was really excited when my 5-year-old son took interested in the “TMNT” franchise earlier this year. He memorized the names of the characters, friends and villains. We read early reading books about their adventures together. We even watched some episode of the 1990s cartoon (though yes, we had to skip some that were too scary). Raising my kids with a love of Judaism is one of my biggest priorities as a parent, but raising them to share my love for the dorky franchises that buoyed me throughout my childhood also gives me much joy.
And so, last weekend, I eagerly took him and my brother, who was in town from Israel, to watch the new “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” directed by Jeff Rowe and produced and co-written by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. Rogen even introduced the movie himself in an adorable little clip, telling viewers to enjoy the film. I relate to Rogen, who says, “For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Fan.” I imagined my son saying that one day, too.
The movie is visually stunning. The 3D animation by French Mikros Animation studio has a lot of texture to it and feels appropriately grungy and edgy while still really beautiful. The music is absolutely infectious, with lots of ’90s hip-hop that had us shaking our legs and tapping along. And while some of the jokes feel a little belabored (there’s a milking joke I really couldn’t get into), we all laughed at multiple points in the movie. It’s genuinely a really funny, delightful watch. Or at least it was for me (more on that in a bit).
A lot of changes have been made to the story of the turtles, originally conceived as a subversive comic book in the late 1980s by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This story really leans into the identities of Donatello (Donnie), Michelangelo (Mikey), Raphael (Raph) and Leonardo (Leo), which I really loved — from the choice of voice actors to making their bodies more adolescent sized. I love that April was played by Ayo Edebiri (who is in everything right now, from “The Bear” to the upcoming Emma Seligman movie “Bottoms”). Yet one the most significant updates was made to the character of Splinter, the turtles’ father figure, dubbed in the movie by the brilliant and lovable Jackie Chan. He is no longer a former Japanese ninjutsu turned humanoid rat but a former sewer rat who, like the group of turtle hatchlings, walked into a radioactive goo that turned him into a mutant.
The choice makes more sense, as even Splinter himself says in the movie, but it’s also a big part of the movie’s central narrative. As a former rat, Splinter has a natural apprehension of people, and when he steps into New York’s Times Square, he’s met with so much terror and derision that he never steps up onto the surface again.
The story of that frightening encounter becomes family lore, with Splinter warning his growing children of the human world and training them to fight and defend themselves from the vile humans.
This character of an overprotective father who wants to keep his children in an insular world is certainly universal, or at least familiar for many immigrant cultures. And a lot of stories with mutant heroes make for excellent parables about prosecuted minorities. Yet both my brother and I agreed that what he really felt like was an old Jewish dad, kvetchy and fearful, paranoid about the dangers of the outside world (we all know there is some truth to the hypochondriac Jewish dad caricature) but also overtly loving, affectionate and dedicated (and full of dad jokes).
Splinter’s redesign, which is less aging svelte athlete and more stout and grey, makes him feel almost Tevye-like, as in the protagonist of “Fiddler on the Roof” (which makes sense from Goldberg and especially Rogen, who basically played a version of Tevye in the movie “An American Pickle”). Splinter’s fear of the influence of the human world feels quite comparable to the experience of Jewish assimilation. Splinter wants to keep the turtles close, safe, with their own kind, and holds fast to the predictable rituals of training and pizza dinners. He’s all about hard-earned traditions.
But the turtles want more — they want to be part of the human world. They sneak off to movie screenings, they love anime and video games, skating and making amateur videos — and like any teenagers, they want to belong to something larger than just their nuclear family. They want to make friends! And they have to hide all of that from their father. Throughout most of the movie, the turtles try to track down and fight Flyguy — the movie’s villain, dubbed by the incredible Ice Cube — without their father’s knowledge.
When the turtles get in trouble, Splinter discovers the turtles have been sneaking behind his back, and his response is obvious disappointment. While he agrees to help them out (he is, after all, a good caring father) he vows never to let them return to the human world again after the ordeal is through.
That is, until he experiences a parenting epiphany. It’s a moment when Splinter sees his own inflexibility and harshness as a parent reflected in Flyguy and the way he treats his army of kids, or rather, mutant underlings (which include the adorable skateboarding Mondo Gecko, voiced by a darling Paul Rudd, and a singing Ray Fillet voiced by Post Malone). It’s surprisingly touching. It’s rare to see a parent get that kind of wake up call and answer it, but Splinter does just that.
He realizes that his own values, his own fear of humans, are his, and that he can and should allow his children to live the kind of life they want to — and for that, he needs to get over his paranoias. Part of being a parent, especially a parent whose seen and experienced persecution for his identity, is letting your kids be braver than you were, knowing that they’re growing up in a different world, and that they are allowed to learn their own lessons. It’s also learning to care for the things your kids care about and being their cheerleader. Splinter has a full arc in which he grows for the sake of his kids, and ultimately, that helps him find his own happiness (which involves a pretty disturbing romance with a fellow mutant, but hey, parents are allowed to be a bit kinky too).
As Jewish parents, a lot of us were raised with fears of persecution, fears of the unknown, with fear in general, and there’s something so valuable in letting that go, no matter how scary it may be. The turtles’ dreams of feeling acceptance and belonging in the outside world may seem farfetched; they are, after all, literal mutants. But in the end, by being authentic and kind, they make them happen.
The movie outing was meant to be fun, a bonding experience for my son and his uncle, and in a sense, it was. Yet, just like Splinter in the movie, the experience of watching it was also a bit of a parenting fail, and a lesson, for me.
From the moment the movie opened with an armed raid, I realized I might have made a mistake. Like many a 5-year-old, my son does not like scary movies and TV shows, and his definition of scary is a lot more broad than most, including anything remotely violent or rage-filled.
It was all fine, more or less, with a few cuddle and hand-holding sessions, and lots of popcorn noshing on his part, until we got to the movie’s biggest battle — with its biggest, most frightening monsters. He turned to me and said the words I had been dreading: “I want to go.”
“We can leave,” I told him, “but I’d like you to stay until the end, to see that there’s a happy ending.” The screening was a kid-friendly one, so talking out loud was not taboo. As we watched the dramatic final scene (which was, yeah, pretty gruesome and violent, even by regular “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” standards), my brother and I both tried to explain to him what was going on — comparing it to the video game they had played the day before, telling him that here, all these people are coming together as a community to defeat the villain. We ended up leaving the theater in an OK shape, though I can’t say that my son really enjoyed the movie, and I’m still wondering if I handled it as best I could.
Perhaps, in that moment, I was so over-enthused about passing down a childhood tradition that I forgot to let my kid dictate his own rhythm. I didn’t hear his initial reluctance about watching this movie, and I didn’t realize that he was not even super into this franchise anymore (he’s all about Mario now). Perhaps I should’ve let him leave the theater when he wanted to, or not gone at all when he first waffled about heading to see the film.
All in all, I don’t think I traumatized him in any major way. But the movie was a good reminder for me, as a parent, to respect my kids — when they’re brave, of course, and want to take on the world, but also when they’re fearful.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt2ZWxsZXIuY29tL3RoZS1uZXctdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tb3ZpZS1mZWVscy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nbHktamV3aXNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 20:18:04+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Kicks Off Comic-Con With 20 Minutes of Footage,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Mayhem brought 20 minutes of footage to San Diego Comic-Con's Hall H.,"It may not have had the star power fans or the studio hoped for, but Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem kicked off the movie panels at San Diego Comic-Con in fine style.
Due to the writers and actors strikes, the studio didn’t have Seth Rogen, who is both one of the movie’s producers and actors, nor any other voice stars. But it did bring out director Jeff Rowe and plenty of footage from the movie.
Twenty minutes of footage, to be precise. Rowe showed off a chunk from the beginning of the movie and, judging by the reaction, it went over gangbusters. The hall, while not packed in the usual way, still had thousands in their seats, and the audience was howling for the film, which opens Aug. 2 in theaters.
Unspooling was an introduction to the four turtle heroes, making a night run for groceries around town, deciding to catch a movie in the park (Ferris Bueller’s Day Off — a Paramount movie, naturally), and thinking how great life would be if only they could be liked by humans and have normal lives. What follows is getting grounded by their father, Splinter, a recap of their origin, an intro to the bad guy, and then their first meeting with human girl April O’Neil, which leaves a bunch of crooks messed up.
And while Rogen wasn’t in attendance, he did make his presence felt via two videos, one which detailed a quick history of the Turtles phenomenon, and another which, paired with Ice Cube (and said to have been made a month ago, before the SAG-AFTRA strike), talked about the movie in general.
Rowe, meanwhile, talked up how much the Turtles meant to him as a child. “It’s what taught me to be a fan,” he said.
And he said Rogen pushed for the angle of focusing on the “teenage” aspect of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, something he thought was underserved.
The film’s art style is a break from the shiny and polished look of many other animated movies, with the filmmakers making the choice to emulate an underground comic vibe.
“We looked at how we used to draw in high school, when you’re so passionate but you don’t know how to draw but you don’t know that you don’t know how to draw yet,” said Rowe. “So you’ll lovingly draw a hand, drawing every fingernail, every wrinkle, but the hand is horribly misshapen. There is no formal art training to encumber your pure expression. And we said, let’s do that.”
The panel wrapped with a surprise appearance by TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman, who announced that Nickelodeon and Paramount have secured the rights to the original TMNT animated series that aired in the late 1980s. He did not give details as to when and on what platform the series would appear.

,Vanilla Ice '90s hit 'Ninja Rap' is in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie with Seth Rogen,"After ”Ice Ice Baby,” '90s rapper Vanilla Ice had a hit that would also stand the test of time: ”Ninja Rap” for ”Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” in 1991","“Go, ninja, go, ninja, go!”
More than 30 years after his song made its debut, Vanilla Ice is having a moment. The world knows the ’90s rapper for his megahit ”Ice Ice Baby” — but another rap of his is generating some new engagement, thanks to the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" reboot by Seth Rogen.
""Ninja Rap"" was performed in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze"" live-action film in 1991 by Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Rob Van Winkle of Wellington, Florida. It's the sequel to the original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie that was released a year earlier.
""TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,"" executive-produced and co-written by Rogen, was trending this week. Here are things to know about Vanilla Ice and his ties to Florida and the ”Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.”
How popular is 'Ninja Rap' by Vanilla Ice?
Like Vanilla Ice on his social media platforms, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" fans are using the #goninjagoninjago hashtag. Some Instagram Reels are set to ”Ninja Rap.” The hashtag's been used on Twitter and TikTok. A check on Spotify two days before the Seth Rogen movie's release — Aug. 2 nationwide — show ""Ninja Rap"" has had more than 7.3 million streams, Vanilla Ice's fourth most popular Spotify. (For those wondering, Vanilla Ice's mega hit ""Ice Ice Baby"" took the Top 3 spots on his music profile in the music streaming service with a collective 371.4 million streams.)
Is Vanilla Ice in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie?
The '90s rapper had a cameo in the 1991 film ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze"" ... as a rapper performing on stage. Rogen said in news reports that he included Van Winkle‘s ”Ninja Rap” in the 2023 reboot's soundtrack along with other rap songs from East Coast artists.
After ”Ice Ice Baby,” this is another Vanilla Ice rap hit that would stand the test of time. To this day, the rapper continues to use ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" references, #goninjagoninjago and #NinjaRap on his platforms.
What is 'The Vanilla Ice Project?'
After his rap career, Vanilla Ice/Rob Van Winkle became a reality TV star on HGTV (home and gardening channel) and DIY Channel (do-it-yourself). For almost 10 years, he hosted ”The Vanilla Ice Project,” with several Florida homes remodeled or renovated.
In 2015, the reality TV star helped build a therapeutic pool for then 6-year-old Owen Johnson of Palm Bay, who was paralyzed in a car accident with his family at 2 years old, according to a USA TODAY story.
For two seasons, the home renovation star hosted ""Vanilla Ice Goes Amish” in 2013.
Outside of HGTV, the rapper competed on season 23 of ABC’s reality competition ”Dancing With the Stars” in 2016. His dance partner was Witney Carson. During his season, he famously formed a bromance with fellow dancetestant former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Spoiler alert: Vanilla Ice did not win the mirror ball trophy and was the 10th celebrity eliminated. Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez won that season.
Where does Vanilla Ice live in Florida?
In addition to his long rap career (he's touring with other '90s bands) and HGTV shows, Van Winkle is also known as a passionate Wellington resident, who is seen in and around Palm Beach County eating, stopping, collaborating and listening (get it? Lyrics from ""Ice Ice Baby"") . He lives in Wellington.
In August 2022, Van Winkle helped open a ""brewery slash museum"" in one of Lake Worth Beach's most historic buildings, according to a story in the Palm Beach Post. He helped restore a 100-year-old Masonic building about a block from City Hall into a four-level entertainment venue with a rooftop bar.
What is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles about?
""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is a popular franchise about four teenage turtles named after legendary artists from the Renaissance, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo — and their Sensei-slash-father Splinter the rat. Splinter raised the turtles from shell to teendom and taught them martial arts while living in the sewer. They befriend a TV reporter, April O'Neil, and nemeses in the series or movies often include Shredder, mutants Rock Steady and Bebop, and occasionally friend-foe Casey Jones, a hockey mask-wearing vigilante with martial arts skills of his own.
Over the years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" has been a cartoon series, an animated series, a trilogy of live-action films in the '90s, and a Michael Bay reboot in 2014 and 2016 starring Meghan Fox.
The 2023 reboot stars martial arts star Jackie Chan as Splinter, Shamon Brown Jr., Micah Abbey, Brady Noon and Nicolas Cantu. Rogen, Chan's co-star in the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies, and several other celebrities (John Cena, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Paul Rudd) have voice cameos in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.""

2023-08-18 18:55:46.343000,Is ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ good for kids?,Teens want to see characters more authentic to their lived experience,"“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” hit theaters earlier this month and is the latest addition to what has turned out to be a very fun summer at the movies.
The film features turtle brothers Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael and Donatello who became mutants as infants after being exposed to mutant-ooze created by a lonely scientist trying to form his own family of mutant animals.
They are raised in a sewer by Splinter, their adoptive mutant-rat father who trains them in martial arts after being ostracized by the human world above ground. The turtles befriend April, a human teenager, who helps them uncover, and foil, another mutant’s evil plan to destroy humanity.
There is much to love about the latest version of “TMNT” from creators Seth Rogan, Jeff Rowe and Evan Goldberg. My family and I saw it the weekend the film opened, and we all had different reasons for enjoying it.
The movie is full of throwback treats for elder millennials like my husband and myself who grew up watching the original cartoon series. I knew Michelangelo as a turtle first and as an Renaissance artist second. The soundtrack features some of the greatest hits from our childhood like “No Diggity” from Blackstreet and “Can I Kick It?” from A Tribe Called Quest.
My 8- and 4-year-olds enjoyed the age-appropriate humor and thrilling action sequences. My tween, who is an aspiring illustrator, loved the animation style similar to what she’d seen in “Mitchells Vs. The Machines” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”
Writer-director Jeff Rowe calls the purposefully less-than-perfect animation “a reaction to a 30-year trend in 3D CG animation to push towards photorealism and hyper-realistic lighting and texturing,” in an interview with Variety. “We decided we wanted this movie to look exactly like concept artwork, and we want the concept artwork to feel distinctly human and not computer-generated.”
“Distinctly human” is the term that best identifies what’s at the heart of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” somewhat paradoxically, with four turtles and their adopted father, who is a human-sized rat, in starring roles.
While the film spoke to my entire family, I believe it can speak best, like no previous version of “TMNT” has, to teens, the demographic at the center of the movie. Anyone between the ages of 12 and 18 will likely see themselves in the gangly, awkward and not yet fully formed turtles. This is a change from the cartoons of my youth.
Back then, the turtles were teens in name only. They had rippling muscles and spoke in the deep tones of the voice actors who portrayed them. This is how entertainment for children and teens has almost always been done — actors in their mid to late 30s often play 16-year-olds in teen media, and screenwriters and producers well into adulthood write scripts with dialogue unlike anything real teens actually say. Awkward female characters suddenly become beautiful women after one makeover and a dramatic removal of their glasses. Misfit young men become popular, grown males with one successful football pass.
When I became a teenager, I felt confused when I didn’t look like those 30-year-olds pretending to be in high school and instead looked (and felt) like I was stuck in a pubescent limbo between childhood and adulthood. Finding the right friends and a real sense of belonging was more complicated than my film and television consumption had led me to believe.
I would have appreciated more media representation of teens who were still growing into themselves, physically and emotionally, not teens played by actors in their late 20s saying lines written by studio executives who have no memory of how teenhood actually felt.
A recent survey published in UC Berkeley’s “Greater Good Magazine” found that most media created for teens does not feel authentic to the viewers in the demographic it targets. “Movies and television shows typically targeting American adolescents are often made without a committed consideration of their perspectives,” the authors wrote. “American teenagers now want to see Hollywood content with authentic, inclusive, and positive storytelling that better reflects their true lives and families.”
Yes, the protagonists of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” are cartoon turtles, but they feel authentically teen in the way they just want to be good to each other, make their dad proud and find community among their (human) peers.
The turtles are voiced by four actual teens — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon — and are drawn as lanky with glasses and braces (there must be orthodontists and optometrists in the New York sewer systems). All they really want is to go to high school, make cool videos for social media and attend their prom without disappointing their dad. April, voiced by Ayo Adebiri, just wants to get past an embarrassing vomiting episode on the school news broadcast.
These are the concerns of real teenagers who spend their time doing homework, eating dinner with their family, and finding like-minded buddies. The authors of the Berkeley study write, “Contrary to stereotypical notions of teenage angst and self-absorption ... adolescents are leaning toward stories that provide hope and knowledge of others while also remaining fun and authentic for their age.”
Those adolescents will do well to lean toward the story told through the four teenage mutant ninja turtles.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tLzIwMjMvOC8xOC8yMzgyMzM3MS90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tdGVlbi1yZXByZXNlbnRhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Published Aug 02, 2023
In April 1984, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's black-and-white comic book Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit the newsstands, introducing the world to New York City's favourite heroes in a half-shell. Leonardo, the group's de facto leader, heads the charge as he announces his and his brothers, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael, presence to the Purple Dragons, emphatically proclaiming, ""We're not wearing costumes.""In the nearly 40 years since, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have gone from comic book superheroes to action figures to TV and movie stars and around the world, kids have marked their allegiance with their favourite Turtle (for the record, mine is Michelangelo, for obvious reasons). For generations of children, TMNT dominated recess, Halloween and playtime from Canada to England to Japan, igniting our imaginations as we went into battle with Splinter, April and Casey.In recent years, the Turtles were given the live-action treatment — but in T eenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (in theatres now), our boys are back in animated form. Directed by Jeff Rowe and co-written by Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg , Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, Mutant Mayhem takes us back to the beginning with an all-star cast and killer soundtrack.But before we dive into the sewers for some pizza, here are five facts about the film that you might not know. Cowabunga, dude!Normally in animated films, the voice cast are brought to a sound booth separately to record their individual parts, with crafty editors stitching everything together in post-production. However, in 2019's The Lion King, Seth Rogen, who voiced Pumbaa, was able to actually record alongside Donald Glover and Billy Eichner, the film's Simba and Timon, respectively.Rogen's experience was so positive that he wanted to ensure that the voice actors in Mutant Mayhem were given the same opportunity, telling The Hollywood Reporter , ""We really went out of our way and bent over backwards on Ninja Turtles to try to capture that improvisational energy that you get when a lot of people are in the same place at the same time.""And the proof is in the pudding. Not only is the chemistry between the four Turtles — Nicolas Cantu (Leonardo), Micah Abbey (Donatello), Brady Noon (Raphael) and Shamon Brown Jr. (Michelangelo) — free-flowing and natural, seasoned comedians like Jackie Chan, Hannibal Buress, Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph, and of course, Rogen himself, are clearly relishing in the shared space.Given the name of the group, oddly, the past TMNT works have rarely explored the boys' teenage side. Rowe and Rogen — the latter of whom has a rich and successful resume creating teen comedies — wanted to position Mutant Mayhem as a high school movie, detailing the natural angst involved in growing up as outcasts in society with an over-protective parent.In developing the coming-of-age nature of Mutant Mayhem, Rowe was influenced by the classic films of the genre as well as more modern examples like The Edge of Seventeen and PEN15. ""We wanted it to be like Stand by Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" Rowe told Empire . Naturally, Rogen's Freaks and Geeks and Superbad, also stood in as sources of inspiration, particularly in the humour of Mutant Mayhem.As the first animated TMNT film since 2007, Rowe (who co-directed The Mitchells vs. The Machines ) had his work cut out for him, especially considering audience standards for animation are currently at an all-time high. To create the gorgeous and vivid animation in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen turned to the animation studios of Mikros and Cinesite.Mikros Animation, the animation house behind the PAW Patrol films, utilized hundreds of animators and VFX artists in their Montreal and Paris offices to create the incredible comic book-style artwork, that includes sketches that resemble high school notebook doodling. Cinesite's Vancouver team, a visual effects powerhouse that has worked on Game of Thrones and World War Z, were also tapped to develop the dynamic imagery of Mutant Mayhem that not only brings to life TMNT's comic book roots, but the '90s aesthetic as well.In addition to the electrifying score by Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross , Mutant Mayhem boasts an awesome soundtrack. ""It's a lot of songs that me and Jeff Rowe, the director, ourselves listen to,"" Rogen told ET Canada To reflect the New York City setting and '90s timeframe, Rogen and Rowe curated songs with a heavy '90s East Coast hip-hop and R&B influence, including Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"" and Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya."" The seemingly random assortment of songs on the soundtrack reflect the frenetic nature of a teenager-made mixtape, with the energy and spirit of youth found throughout.Just as important as the Turtles is their father, Splinter. Voiced by Jackie Chan in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen really leaned into the character's dad vibe, as well as the DIY nature of putting together a look living in a sewer.""Jeff Bridges's the Dude character from The Big Lebowski was a big fashion inspiration,"" Mutant Mayhem's lead character designer Woodrow White explained to Den of Geek . ""Splinter's build was [also] partially inspired by Danny DeVito, with his short stature and long arms.""Chan's contributions to the film even go beyond voicing Splinter. Studying Chan's fighting style in films like Police Story and Rumble in the Bronx, Rowe brought the splashy editing and comedic rhythm of those legendary fight sequences into Mutant Mayhem, resulting in some high-energy, action-packed moments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZXhjbGFpbS5jYS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNsYWltLmNhL2FtcGFydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 16:09:01+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Beg BTS’ Jung Kook Not to Watch Them Sing ‘Butter’ in ‘Mutant Mayhem’ Teaser,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sing BTS' 'Butter' in a teaser for the upcoming 'Mutant Mayhem' animated movie reboot.,"It’s right there in the name: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So, given that said bony-shelled reptiles are right in the demo, it’s fitting that in a new promo for the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that is out on Wednesday (Aug. 2), Leo, Raph, Don and Mikey are unabashed members of the ARMY.
“This is it, guys,” Raphael laments in the 20-second clip in which the foursome are lashed to a giant bomb-like device that seems to spell their demise. “Oh, so many regrets,” he groans. “I just wish I could see BTS IRL,” says Donatello.
Leonardo, of course, has a creative idea, offering, “We could do some of the songs for you,” he says, with Michelangelo adding that he’d be down for a few bars. Leo then gets the gang started, singing the first lines of BTS’ global No. 1 smash “Butter,” while encouraging the others to join in. But, given their predicament — they are lashed to a wall by their wrists and ankles — the song comes out as more of a cry than a croon.
It’s all a bit sad, honestly and Don complains that they don’t even really know the words. To be fair, the tweet of the clip had a very stark warning message: “Jung Kook please don’t watch this.”
In addition to the four turtles (voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon), the film also features the voices of Rogen, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph; Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote and co-produced the film directed by Jeff Rowe.

,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Won’t Have Any ‘Boring’ Scenes: ‘The Movie Is Crackling With Energy,’ Says Seth Rogen – Exclusive Image",The heroes in a half shell are getting a vibrant animated overhaul with a sketchy pencil-drawn feel. Read more at Empire.,"Pause any frame from the trailers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and you’ll see an image filled with artistic flourishes. The animated overhaul of TMNT, directed by The Mitchells Vs The Machines co-director Jeff Rowe and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, has a visual style all its own – with an energy you might immediately associate with the Spider-Verse movies, but bearing a distinctive scratchy, scrawly pencil style. Channelling both the sketchy, lo-fi energy of the original off-beat Turtles comics, and the youthful exuberance of its central quartet of characters, Mutant Mayhem has been imagined as a lead-on-paper doodle come to vivid life.
The result should be another animated movie this summer that pushes the art form in a new direction. “The film itself is permeated with this teenage energy – where you don’t stay in the lines, and you’re pushing harder on the stuff that you like, and you’re impressionably scribbling in the background,” Rogen tells Empire. And once they saw what was possible visually, it upped their writing game too. “We started to write to the animation style,” he says. “It needed to capture that – we can never have boring scenes, because the movie itself just seems to be crackling with energy.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbXBpcmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL21vdmllcy9uZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS13b250LWhhdmUtYm9yaW5nLXNjZW5lcy1zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 19:29:31+00:00,Does Splinter Kiss A Male Cockroach In The New 'Ninja Turtles' Movie?,Conspiracies surround the marketing for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"Is Paramount covering up the fact that Splinter is gay in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie? That’s certainly the conspiracy theory flying across the internet.
This all started when YouTube movie reviewer Price of Reason went to an early screening of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — which premiered on Aug. 2 — and was angered that the movie portrayed the mutant rat voiced by Jackie Chan as gay.
In the film, a romance blossoms between Splinter and a mutant cockroach named Scumbag. “To add insult to injury,” he said in the video, “at the end of the movie Splinter is seen making out with Scumbug and then professing his love for Scumbug who he seemingly enters into a relationship with.”
You may be asking yourself how he came to this conclusion. Well, it’s all based on a series of movie posters released by ParamountUK that introduced audiences to each character. For the poster featuring Scumbag the text read, “Scumbug as himself,” meaning that Splinter was having a make-out sesh with a male cockroach.
“Now that in and of itself is already out of character for Splinter as we’ve known him for years, as it just doesn’t seem like something he would do,” he said. “But then later after researching the character posters for this movie and also consulting with Tom from Midnight’s Edge, I’ve come to the conclusion that they’ve decided to present Splinter in this movie as an LGBT character, a creative decision that I disagree with since he’s never been presented that way in the 40 years that this franchise has existed.”
Splinter is not canonically queer in any of the various movies, TV shows, or comics, in fact, little attention is ever paid to the talking rat’s romantic life. And despite the pronouns on the poster which imply Splinter has a gay romance in the film, Scumbag is portrayed as a female cockroach throughout TMNT: Mutant Mayhem.
The misleading poster has since been deleted from social media, leading some to believe that Paramount may have originally intended the romance between Splinter and Scumbag to be queer, but have since walked it back because of the backlash.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByaWRlLmNvbS9nYXktbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Director Jeff Rowe told Insider that he learned several Gen Z phrases while making the film.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" director Jeff Rowe said that he learned lots of new phrases from the movie's Gen Z cast members.
Rowe and producer Seth Rogen cast teen actors, whose ages range between 15 and 19, to voice the titular turtles, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.
The cast — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Brady Noon, and Nicolas Cantu — recorded their lines together in the same booth in order to allow them to riff off each other.
In an interview with Insider, Rowe said that some of the conversations between the turtles in the movie were improvised by the actors.
""There's this very funny scene where the turtles are just talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. Like, 'Hey, we're gonna be like real New Yorkers. Get a bacon egg, and cheese sandwich.' And they're all like quoting different YouTube videos that they watch and they just go off for like a minute talking about that,"" Rowe said.

""We didn't script that. They just did that in between takes. I think they were just legitimately talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. And then they were like, 'Make sure you're rolling,'"" the director continued.

Rowe added: ""And then we just put that in the film. It's totally improvised and totally not planned. It's unwritable. I don't think you can write that.""
Rowe said that he and the producers had to check if the teens' conversations were appropriate for the PG-13 movie, especially when they used Gen Z slang.
""I learned what 'rizz' is,"" Rowe said. ""They would say stuff and then we'd be like, 'Cool. Just say it like that. Wait, is that offensive? Is that beyond PG-13? What? Okay. No? It's cool.'""
Rizz is short for charisma and is used in romantic situations when a person is able to effortlessly charm another person.

2023-08-03 03:16:49.588000+00:00,Ninja Turtles seem truly like teenagers in ‘Mutant Mayhem’,"More than ever, franchise’s new adventure gives itself over to the mindset of adolescence.","There are some good gags and clever innovations in the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” but there is one brilliant idea: casting Ice Cube as the voice of the movie’s mutant insect supervillain Super Fly.
It might have once been hard to foresee the value of having the MC who rapped of “dropping bombs on your moms” as the MVP of a PG-rated kids movie. But we’re now up to the seventh “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film, not counting all the series and videogames. That’s a lot of movies for a bit of IP that’s clung more firmly to lunch boxes than it has to pop culture. For the turtles, it was getting to be time to either, as Ice Cube would say, “chickity-check yo’ self” or try something new.
“Mutant Mayhem” can’t entirely get over the feeling of trodding over well-covered turtle ground. But if we must go once more into the ooze, the film by director Jeff Rowe (co-director of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and co-written by co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is probably the best of a not-so-stellar franchise. It’s certainly the one most invested with that “teenage” part of the turtles’ name. Plus, it’s got Ice Cube as a fly who quotes from the O’Jays.
‘‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’
Untitled Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Jeff Rowe and written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit. Running time: 99 minutes. Rated PG (for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material). Now showing at local theaters.
The animation is vividly textured, the beat is persistently hip-hop (Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and others pack the electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and the New York of the film is impressively detailed. But the most important twist to this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” iteration may be diving into the teenage-ness of its 15-year-old turtles.
If “Barbie” was balanced between Greta Gerwig’s childhood memories and her adult feminism, “Mutant Mayhem” gives itself over more fully to the mindset of adolescence. That’s in the gross-out humor and the comic book-like feel of the animation. But these are also recognizable teenagers who watch movies (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”), pine for concert tickets and make goofy phone videos of themselves slicing watermelons.
What Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) and Raphael (Brady Noon) really want is to fit in and go to high school like other teens. They have been relegated to the sewer ever since Splinter, a rat voiced by Jackie Chan, happened upon them after they were exposed as hatchlings to the same ooze that spawned Super Fly — who himself was the product of experiments by scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito, fated to dubious laboratories).
Splinter has much the same opinion of the majority of the rats in “Ratatouille”: Humans can’t be trusted. (Splinter’s particular fear is that they will “milk” him.) So the turtles have grown up undergroundwhile yearning for the wider world.
They find a hint of it with a high-school journalist named April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), who wants to document, and thus prove to humankind, their decency. At the same, the turtles meet the charismatic Super Fly and his band of mutants. At first, they’re fast-friends — “cousins,” Super Fly says — but the turtles then start hearing of Super Fly’s plans to turn all animals into mutants and eradicate the world of humans.
“Peoples, they got to go,” chimes one mutant.
Some of the thunder of “Mutant Mayhem” has been stolen by “Into the Spider-Verse” and this year’s “Across the Spider-Verse” — films that likewise upend the typical look of studio animation and do it with a pulsing soundtrack; but they did it more eclectically.
Yet this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” while a half shell of those films, has its own low-key charms. It’s goofier, grosser and mostly fun. The four turtles are never more than a hard-to-differentiate bale of overlapping dialogue of doubt and anxiety. But that first word in their name finally feels genuine. Seven films in, it’s only right that Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael should get a renaissance.

,I worked on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from thousands of miles away,Artist Sean Sevestre has played a key role in the creation of the film despite being based in Edinburgh.,"I worked on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from thousands of miles away
By Angie Brown BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter

Sean Sevestre has played a key role in the creation of the new blockbuster film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - despite being thousands of miles away from his Hollywood colleagues.
The 29-year-old Scottish artist has worked on the visual development of the hit new movie for two years from his Edinburgh home.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which stars Seth Rogan, Jackie Chan and John Cena, was released earlier this month.
Sean worked as a concept artist on the movie. He would draw the ideas, then a 3D animator would makes a graphic model from his designs.
""So far this is the most impact I've had in a film,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""Hollywood is high paced and exciting and the people I worked with on this film reflected that.
""I felt extremely respected and trusted. There was always room for me to try stuff and to make mistakes and to work on things.
""When I watched the film I thought it looked amazing - there is nothing that has ever looked like this before.""
Paramount
Mutant Mayhem was released earlier this month
Sean spent a decade teaching himself how to draw and make films.
""I started a product design degree at university when I was 17 but after four weeks I quit because it became clear it wasn't going to teach me what I wanted to do,"" he explained.
""I then enrolled at art college on a painting degree but again I left after two weeks.
""I felt so strongly about it that I decided to teach myself. My mum gave me two years to see if I could make it work.""
From his bedroom in Penicuik, Midlothian, he began to teach himself techniques using the internet.
""My mum was fairly sceptical but she trusted me because I'm not an irrational person.
""I had a burning fire inside me. I was so serious about it that I taught myself relentlessly every day.
""I studied the anatomy of the body and how it moves and how light works.""
Paramount
Sean said there had been a lot to learn.
""I disappeared for three years and looking back it's a bit of a blur.
""I was obsessed in a good way. I pushed myself as hard as I could and gave up a lot of social stuff.""
When he was 20, Sean he felt he had reached a good base level and started posting some of his work on sites where Hollywood producers look for new talent.
It was then he was asked to work on the movie A Monster Calls, which starred Liam Neeson.
""I was so excited because it felt like a breakthrough
""All of a sudden my mum could see things were working for me.""
Sean said he learned from his entrepreneurial dad to have the confidence to teach himself.

Sean taught himself to do competitive tricking
He said: ""My parents divorced when I was five and I would see my dad in the holidays. We would go snowboarding and I would say: 'I can't snowboard.' He would say: 'I taught myself so can you'.""
Sean learned classical guitar and taught myself to do competitive tricking, a form of acrobatics involving flips and twists.
""I got good at tricking and this gave me the confidence to know that I could teach myself anything I put my mind to.""
He was then commissioned to work on pop superstar Lil Nas X's Starwalkin' video and directed his own feature-length documentary, Perfect Storm.
Now he has built a studio in his Portobello home in Edinburgh.
""Now I actually have to turn down work that comes in which is an incredible place to be,"" he said.
""Growing up in a small town in Scotland I never thought I'd end up working in Hollywood.
""But thanks to the internet I was able to make a name for myself in the industry even though I felt far away from that world.""
Sean Sevestre

Sean got a B in Higher art at Beeslack High School in Midlothian.
He added: ""I wasn't the art guy, nobody expected this.
""I've not got this crazy talent. What I do is a result of extreme deliberate practice that has taken me from being average to someone now with a reputation.
""Anyone who wants it badly enough can do it. It's dedicated time and practice and hard work continually sitting at the edge of your ability that gets you there.""
So what's next for Sean?
""I'm working on something exciting just now, but I can't talk about it.
""I'm still pushing myself and looking to achieve more.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1zY290bGFuZC1lZGluYnVyZ2gtZWFzdC1maWZlLTY2NTMzMDM20gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLXNjb3RsYW5kLWVkaW5idXJnaC1lYXN0LWZpZmUtNjY1MzMwMzYuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 17:23:20+00:00,Seth Rogen Reveals How the Avengers Reference in TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Came to Be,Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe reveals that Seth Rogen came up with the idea for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to be Marvel fans.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe recently revealed that producer/actor Seth Rogen came up with the idea for the Heroes in a Half Shell to reference the Marvel superhero team, the Avengers, in the animated film.
Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Rowe explained that Rogen immediately came up with the idea that the turtles would have seen all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. “Seth was like, ‘Oh, I’m sure they’ve seen Avengers,'” the director said. “And for them, it’s like, ‘The Hulk saves the world [in Avengers: Endgame], so no one’s scared of him, and he can take selfies with people in a diner.’ And then when it came time to record the kids debating this decision, we were like, ‘We should just have them use the exact argument that we’re using in our story discussions. Let’s have the kids say that.'”
The Heroes in a Half Shell get animated
Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., and Nicolas Canto lead the voice cast of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem as the titular Heroes in a Half Shell — Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Leonardo, respectively. Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Paul Rudd, among others, also lend their voices to the film.
“After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,” reads the official film synopsis. “Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.”
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opened in theaters on Wednesday, August 2, 2023. The animated film has so far grossed $51.6 million worldwide.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL25ld3MvNTQzNTg0LXRtbnQtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1wcm9kdWNlci1zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLWNhbWUtdXAtd2l0aC1hdmVuZ2Vycy1yZWZlcmVuY2XSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXBlcmhlcm9oeXBlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU0MzU4NC10bW50LW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcHJvZHVjZXItc2V0aC1yb2dlbi1jYW1lLXVwLXdpdGgtYXZlbmdlcnMtcmVmZXJlbmNlL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 14:00:00+00:00,How Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Puts a Fresh Spin on the Franchise,"Actual teenagers and a fresh, wild art style mark a new era for the classic franchise in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","This appreciation dripped into the team’s approach to Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen says the filmmakers strove to keep what was drafted in the concept art. “I’ve been through this process so many times where you see the concept art and by the time you’re making the movie, it has lost all of its energy. That did not happen here,” he reveals. “It was asymmetrical and imperfect. I remember the first time seeing it dimensionalized, and it blew my mind.”
The Turtles in the Room
The story and style of Mutant Mayhem boast teenage vigor, but to hear adults voicing the core team would betray all that the filmmakers envisioned. So it was critical that, for the first time ever, the Ninja Turtles are played by actual teenagers. “Part of the spirit we were trying to capture was to make the movie fun, like kids playing with toys,” says Rogen, revealing that even his adult co-stars had fun playing off each other IRL. “That was something we talked about. How do we make it feel fun and silly? This reckless weirdness that almost every kid playing with their toys has?”
Actors Nicolas Cantu (The Walking Dead: World Beyond), Brady Noon (Good Boys), Shamon Brown Jr. (The Chi), and Micah Abbey (Grey’s Anatomy) voice Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, respectively. In an unusual turn for any major animation project, Mutant Mayhem recorded the cast in-person, together, allowing them to improvise lines. The goal was to capture the authenticity of teens hanging out—something that no adult screenwriter can replicate in Final Draft.
Casting was “arduous,” according to Rogen. Citing his own experiences in voiceover work, Rogen strove to mitigate factors that can sometimes leave animation projects feeling inauthentic. “A recurring frustration I have is that you never perform with the other actors,” he says. “The magic of our work that people like is a result of being in the moment and playing off each other. That energy was important to capture. So we went through painstaking lengths to make sure that as much as possible, they all recorded together.”
Fittingly, this approach to recording enabled the filmmakers to see their adolescent stars slowly become their characters—and vice versa. “They’re very much [acting like] themselves,” Rowe says. “So much of the dialogue is just things they said to each other.
I cannot think of another animated film at this scale that’s worked that way, in casting kids and letting them be their authentic selves. We wanted these characters to be complex and feel like people you knew.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1uZXctc3Bpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-06 21:04:24+00:00,Long Range Box Office Forecast: NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM and MEG 2 Early Prospects; BARBIE Tracking Soars,"With summer movies currently in full swing, this week's update welcomes the addition of August's first major releases in a peak at the final month of the season: The Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","Images courtesy Paramount; Warner Bros.
With the summer movie season currently in full swing, this week’s update brings us through to August with the releases of Meg 2: The Trench and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.
In addition, this week’s long range forecast offers a significant update on Warner Bros.’ Barbie, listed in the table below. Pre-sales for the highly anticipated adaptation continue to impress, leading The Little Mermaid by a significant margin and comparing favorably to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 at the same point prior to release. Barbie’s head-to-head box office opening with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer continues to drive intense social media engagement for both films.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount Pictures
August 2, 2023 (WIDE)
3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $27M-$36M
5-Day Opening Weekend Range: $37M-$49M
Domestic Total Range: $101M-$145M
PROS:
The Turtles brand has been successfully reinvented and reintroduced to modern youngsters a few times since its inception in the 1980s, most recently with the 2014 and 2016 live action box office hits. Nostalgia is also a factor here, as older fans are a key driver of interest in this new entry.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, with their production studio Point Grey Pictures, have a solid track record of box office success in recent years, with Good Boys, Sausage Party, and other films. The expectation here is that the creative team will execute a blend of modern and classic sensibilities with an eye towards ensuring the franchise’s endurance.
The absence of any other late summer animated options—or, for that matter, films catering to young males—puts this film in a strong position during the dog days of the season before school starts again. The use of an edgier animation style that embraces 2D and 3D to produce a comic book aesthetic, comparable to Sony’s Spider-Verse films, could further help Mutant Mayhem stand out with fans and young audiences.
CONS:
As seen with last summer’s DC League of Super-Pets, not all animated wide releases based on IP succeed at the box office. Turtles will need to stand out beyond its fan base and generate positive word of mouth to live up to its potential, especially in the wake of several aging franchises underperforming so far this summer.
Premium screen space could still be hard to come by, with other summer releases—like Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning—hoping to regain some of those auditoriums in their chase weeks.
If Disney’s Haunted Mansion breaks out, Turtles could have more competition than it hoped for.
Meg 2: The Trench
Warner Bros. Pictures
August 4, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $26M-$35M
Domestic Total Range: $70M-$105M
PROS:
The first Meg was a sleeper box office hit, opening to $45.4 million and legging out to $145.5 million domestically five summers ago.
The return of Jason Statham should assure the return of both his own fans and those who enjoyed the original.
Meg 2, like its predecessor, is well-positioned in the final weeks of summer movie season. An expected premium screen presence should also give it a boost.
CONS:
Competition could be notable this time around with the aforementioned appeal of Turtles to male audiences of varying ages, plus the potential staying power of other July releases. Titles such as Gran Turismo, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, Blue Beetle, and Strays will aim to get some of Meg 2‘s male moviegoers throughout August.
Historically, and particularly in recent memory, action sequels such as Meg 2 have not always lived up to their predecessors’ box office performances.

,Seth Rogen Talks Remaking 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Starring Actual Teenagers (Exclusive),'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' hits theaters on Aug. 2.,"Everyone's favorite sewer-dwelling, pizza-gobbling, crime-fighting reptiles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, but this time there's one major difference -- the titular turtles are actually played by teenagers!
""They're often middle-aged men doing Teenage-Voiced Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" joked Seth Rogen when he sat down with ET's Will Marfuggi to talk about how a life-long love of the titular turtles led to writing and producing the latest installment in the long-running franchise.
""I was really the target audience for the first iteration of all this stuff,"" he explained, noting that he watched the TMNT cartoons and movies as a kid and was ""obsessed"" with the toys. ""My dad bought like, a big box of used Ninja Turtle toys at a garage sale when I was a kid, and so I had those and I played with them so much.""
However, Rogen admitted, ""I always thought that the 'Teenage' part of it was weirdly under-explored, you know?""
For his movie, the Dumb Money star added in more details about the turtles' desire to be just regular teens, and wanted the cast to be made up of voice actors that were closer in age to their characters than past iterations.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star Brady Noon, 17, is Raphael, the bravest and strongest -- but also most impulsive -- of his brothers, who wears a red mask and fights with two pronged sai weapons.
Paramount Pictures
The Amazing World of Gumball's Nicolas Cantu, 19, plays Leonardo, ""the leader and the most honorable and responsible"" of the turtles, who wears blue and wields two katana.
Paramount Pictures
Cousins for Life star Micah Abbey, 15, plays the ""wise and resourceful"" Donatello, who wears a purple mask and wields a bō staff.
Paramount Pictures
And The Chi's Shamon Brown Jr., 19, is Michelangelo, the heart and charismatic soul of the family. ""Mikey,"" as his brothers call him, dons an orange mask and primarily fights with nunchucks, though he's wielded other weapons throughout the years.
Paramount Pictures
""It's always [been] the same kind of energy, from the beginning,"" Brown Jr. said of stepping into a beloved role that multiple actors have played throughout the years. ""Mikey, personally, being like the funny one and you know, the loving one, I kind of embodied that in to this, just [adding] the modern day feel to it.""
Part of that modern feel, Rogen admitted, came from letting the core foursome improvise and inject some modern-day teen speak to make up for the old, outdated ""cowabungas"" -- which would feel totally anachronistic in 2023.
""I think it was so important that the freedom that Jeff [Rowe, Mutant Mayhem director] and Seth gave us and kind of the trust that they put into us being like, 'I think these kids know the generation better then we do as older men,'"" Noon shared, earning a guffaw from Rogen. ""I think that that was really important that we just had that trust and [knew] certain slangs that we can put into the film to make it better understanding for our generation.""
""Most of it was just Seth and Jeff giving us like, the reins to be crazy,"" Cantu agreed, recalling that Rogen and Rowe would often hear the boys joking around off-camera and ask them to recreate the dialogue in the booth.
""We cast them well and we just knew if they were essentially themselves, honestly, that it would convey the right dynamic and it would be the right energy,"" Rogen noted. ""That was like so helpful and it's why the movie feels natural, and I think why you stop thinking of them as turtles and you start thinking of them as teenagers within like, 30 seconds of seeing them on screen.""
For Rogen, it was an exercise in feeling a bit out of his depth as a writer.
""A large part of it was acknowledging, like, I don't know how these kids talk anymore,"" he admitted. ""When we wrote Superbad, we had such a handle of how 18-year-olds in 2004 spoke, you know what I mean? But now it's like 20 years later... We don't want to sound like 40-year-old men writing for teenagers.""
""I don't know half the stuff they say in the movie,"" he joked, teasing the cast, ""I signed off on it. I've heard since that it's really offensive.""
The film also stars Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rogen as Bebop, John Cena as Rocksteady, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito and Maya Rudolph.

2023-08-19 15:45:00+00:00,TMNT: MUTANT MAYHEM Concept Art Spotlights Mutant Characters Who Didn't Appear,"Some new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem concept art has been shared online, and it reveals that several original mutant character were originally going to appear...","Concept artist Dustin d'Arnault has shared some of his designs for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and it reveals a number of weird and wonderful characters that didn't end up featuring in the movie.
The Seth Rogen-produced animated reboot introduced new versions of several well-known heroes and villains from TMNT lore, but it seems a few original mutants were also considered early on in the production process.
As d'Arnault explains in his caption, Wingnut is the only established character pictured here (and the only one who appeared in the movie), and she's joined by some pretty awesome-looking fellow hybrids.
""I had the incredible opportunity to come up with some new mutant characters for the film. All of them, save for Wingnut, are unique designs. Dubbed 'Pro-Mutants,' they were envisioned as government-funded mutant soldiers developed by Baxter for the US Military and Nickelodeon Consumer Products complex. Though the script took a different turn, I'm still holding out for the day when my boys—Cmdr. Roy Fin, Suckerpunch, and the rest of the squad—find their place in the TMNT universe!""
The artist also reveals that the movie's ending was originally going to be a little different, with the entire population of New York City mutated into human/animal hybrids (we assume they would have changed back after Superfly's defeat).
""During the initial phases of production, the script envisioned a final act where the entire NYC population was mutated. Here are some rough concepts of animal and hybrid character designs.
Check out the designs at the links below.
“After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.”
Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon will voice the roles of Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael, respectively. The cast also includes Jackie Chan as Splinter, Hannibal Buress as Genghis Frog, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, Ice Cube as Superfly, Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut, Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Post Malone as Ray Fillet, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, and Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom.

2023-06-23 09:00:00+00:00,TMNT: MUTANT MAYHEM - More Social Media Reactions Arrive After Paramount Screening,"Following a work-in-progress cut of the movie debuting at the Annecy Festival last week, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem screened for a select few at Paramount, and the reactions are in.","A work-in-progress cut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem screened at the Annecy Animation Festival last week, and the reactions were very positive. Now, the social media embargo has lifted for the first press showings of the version of the animated reboot that'll be hitting theatres this August.
The movie seems to have screened for a select few journalists at Paramount, and while we only have a few Tweets for now (other screenings still seem to be taking place), they are just as gushing. It seems fans of the Heroes in a Half-Shell are in for a treat.
Check out some Tweets below, and we'll update as more reactions are shared.
Brilliant decision to have the Turtles voiced by actual teenagers - it adds so much to the film tonally, but also the humor pops more. Yes it’s an origin story, but it pulls the best parts of the #TMNT lore & adds a freshness to it all.

2023-07-31 14:00:15+00:00,August 2023 box office preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ kicks off last month of summer,"August is often referred to as the ""Dog Days of Summer,"" because at a certain point, the box office just dies.","August is often referred to as the “Dog Days of Summer,” and it’s not just because of the intense heat that is permeating the country, but also because at a certain point, the box office just dies, as people go on vacation and others prepare to return to school in September.
This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.
Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)
The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.
“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)
A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)
Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.
“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)
Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.
“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)
A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”
“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)
Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.
“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)
Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.
“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)
Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.
“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)
Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?
“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)
Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.
“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)
Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.
SEE Box office: All time domestic top-grossing movies
Time to get into some limited releases …
“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)
The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.
“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)
Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.
“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)
Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.
“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)
Another popular horror film from this year’s Sundance is Laura Moss’ twist on Frankenstein with the underrated Marin Ireland playing a morgue technician trying to reanimate her little girl using materials from a pregnant woman (Judy Reyes).
“The Adults” (Variance – Aug. 18)
Michael Cera, Sophia Lillis (“Stranger Things,” “Enola Holmes”) and Hannah Gross star in the latest indie dramedy from Dustin Guy Defa (“Person to Person”), playing siblings dealing with the death of their mother. It premiered at Berlin earlier this year, then played Tribeca Festival.
“Bottoms” (United Artists – Aug. 25)
At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.
“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)
This stop-motion animated film written and directed by Jim Capobianco follows the life of Leonardo da Vinci with a voice cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Daisy Ridley, Stephen Fry and Matt Berry. (This is also getting a moderate release in a very busy late August weekend.)
“Scrapper” (Kino Lorber – Aug. 25)
Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) plays the absent father of a child (Lola Campbell) who decides to live on her own after her mother dies in this feature directorial debut from Charlotte Regan.
That’s it for this month. September will be all about the festivals and the official start of Oscar season as the box office tends to slow down even more.

2023-08-06 14:41:04+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Crosses $1B Globally, ‘Meg 2’ and ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Add to Moviegoing Boom",'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' opens to $43 million and 'Meg 2: The Trench' to $30 million as 'Barbie' stays No.,"Turtles and a humongous shark helped fuel another great weekend for moviegoing as the Barbenheimer parade continued.
Greta Gerwig‘s Barbie grossed another $53 million at the domestic box office as it hit $459.4 million in North America and crossed $1 billion globally in a huge win for the filmmakers, Warner Bros. and Mattel. The global number includes an impressive $572.1 million from the foreign box office for a worldwide cume through Sunday of $1.03 billion. It is the second film of the year to cross $1 billion after Universal and Illumination’s family pic The Super Mario Bros ($1.35 billion).
The Barbenheimer parade resulted in another huge moviegoing weekend even as the dual strikes threaten the gains theatrical is making. Combined domestic revenue for all films came in at around $180 million, up a staggering 90 percent from the same frame last year and even 19 percent up over 2019.
Gerwig’s Barbie is the first live-action film in history that’s directed by a woman solo to join the global billion-dollar club. It is already the biggest live-action film of all time domestically for a female director, solo or otherwise, after passing up the $413 million earned by in North America by Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman and the $426 million earned by Captain Marvel, which was directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.
Not often are veteran studio executives rendered speechless, but that’s how movie distribution chiefs Jeff Goldstein and Andrew Cripps described themselves on Sunday. “’Barbillion’ has blown even our most optimistic predictions out of the water,” they said in a statement. Added Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group co-CEOs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy in the statement: “With Barbie becoming the biggest film at the summer box office, Greta now joins an elite group of writer/directors whose singular vision has generated $1 billion at the global box office, a milestone that is a testament to her brilliance and to her commitment to deliver a movie that Barbie fans of every age want to see on the big screen.” (Barbie was mostly done by the time previous movie chief Toby Emmerich and top production executive Courtenay Valenti exited, but Abdy is said to have played a key role regarding certain last-minute production decisions.) And De Luca and Abdy oversee distribution and marketing.
Among all films, Barbie is the 53rd movie in history to cross $1 billion worldwide, and among only a few Warners titles to do so.
Barbie had no trouble staying No. 1 over the Aug. 4-6 weekend, while fellow Warners release Meg 2: The Trench opened in second place domestically with an estimated $30 million, compared to $45 million for 2018 summer success The Meg, which launched amid a far-less-crowded marketplace. The sequel earned a B- CinemaScore, not uncommon for a pic laced with horror.
Overseas, Meg 2 swam off with an impressive $112 million from its first 76 markets — including $26 million in China, a big sum considering the current climate — for a global start of $142 million against a reported budget of $129 million before marketing.
Universal’s Oppenheimer, like Barbie, remained a force of nature in its third outing as it raced past $500 million worldwide. In North America, it earned $28.7 million for a domestic tally of $228.6 million. Overseas, it earned another $52.8 million for an offshore haul of $552.9 million.
The Christopher Nolan-directed pic about the making of the atomic bomb finished Sunday with an estimated global tally of $552.9 million, the top gross ever for a World War II pic ahead of Nolan’s Dunkirk ($527 million) and Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan ($482 million), not adjusted for inflation. And the three-hour film is already the fifth-best showing ever for Nolan domestically, and one of the top biographical dramas of all time, not adjusted. It is also his biggest non-superhero pic in a slew of markets.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, similar to The Meg 2, likewise came in ahead of expectations with a five-day debut of $43.1 million, including $28 million for the three-day weekend. The movie’s performance further cements Paramount’s standout success in the PG space, and depending on where it tops out, should successfully reboot the TMNT big-screen franchise.
The PG-rated pic, written by Seth Rogen and appealing heavily to boys, is one of the best-reviewed studio films of the year and earned a stellar A CinemaScore from audiences. Mutant Mayhem opened mid-week in order to get a jump on the competition. Overseas, it earned $8.2 million from its first raft of markets for an early global tally of $51.3 million, and has little competition in sight.
Mutant Mayhem and Meg 2 are the first movies to feel the full weight of not having stars or influencers able to promote the film in the final three weeks leading up to their release. And the WGA strike presented an additional challenge because of Rogen.
Elsewhere, Disney’s live-action Haunted Mansion continued to scare off audiences. It plunged 63 percent in its sophomore outing to $9 million for a domestic tally of $42 million and $59.6 million globally.
Angel Studios’ sleeper hit Sound of Freedom fell to No. 6 domestically, grossing an estimated $7.6 million in its fifth weekend for a whopping total of $164 million (it has yet to open overseas). It’s still doing more business in North America than Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, which ended its fourth weekend with $151 million in domestic ticket sales and has lost hope of rebounding.
Sony’s Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse celebrated Insidious: The Red Door crossing $182 million at the global box office, including $101.8 million offshore, and becoming the top-grossing Hollywood horror pic of the year to date (M3gan was the previous best at $180 million).

2023-08-06 14:35:00+00:00,"2023 Domestic Box Office Surges Past $6 Billion This Weekend Due To ‘Barbie’, ‘Oppenheimer’, ‘Turtles’ & ‘Meg 2’ As Strikes Continue – Sunday Update","The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.' Barbie jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in day 14. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Eyes Second With $30M 3-day, $45M 5-day.","Sunday AM Writethrough after Saturday AM update: As the Hollywood labor stoppage continues, the 2023 box office rally rages on, as domestic box office soars past $6 billion, +22% over the same January-August period a year ago. This weekend for all movies stands at an estimated $178M. This is the fourth time in box office history to have four movies cross $25M; the last time was Thanksgiving weekend 2018.
We always knew this weekend would beat the first frame of August a year ago ($92M), and that’s happening at +94%. But the current Friday-Sunday is also kicking the first weekend of August 2019’s $148.99M by +20%, and that’s when Hobbs & Shaw ruled the chart.
Barbie remains box office queen bee with $53M in weekend 3, after a $17M Friday and $20M Saturday. By EOD, Barbie is roughly $40M shy from passing the half billion mark at the domestic box office, with her gross set to stand at $459.4M. A $1 billion running global cume happens today!
That fierce battle for second place we saw yesterday between Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Oppenheimer, and The Meg 2: The Trench is settling down.
The second place winner is Meg 2 with $30M, an amazing one-two punch for the weekend by Warner Bros. No one was expecting Meg 2 to rank in second place. Here’s the takeaway with Meg 2 this weekend: For all those studios clutching their pearls and worried about stars not doing press and looking to dynamite the rest of the 2023 calendar. Meg 2‘s opening was achieved off a screening program campaign, with in-theater and online trailers and TV spots. I hear that Jason Statham and the cast didn’t do that much press here in the U.S. Such is the plus of opening a sequel off the gas of its established IP. The first Meg‘s campy comedic marketing campaign five years ago already did the heavy lifting in establishing the brand. The sequel’s trailers just needed to run with it.
Beamed Jeff Goldstein, Domestic Distribution President of Warner Bros, “This is an extraordinary time for Barbie fans, as the blowout parties continue. Meg 2 delivered the one-two punch and scared audiences everywhere.”
Uni’s Oppenheimer is third with $28.7M. Since opening, per EntTelligene, Barbenheimer, has pulled in 55.5M moviegoers. Broken out, that’s 39M for Barbie and another 16.5M for Oppenheimer.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, after a great Saturday of $10.3M, +11% over Friday’s $9.3M, is coming in at $28M over 3-days and $43M, which is still great for this $70M production.
Wow, that was easy. Everyone played nice. Typically, when there’s a tie in an upper ranking, especially No. 1, it’s a game of chicken among the majors on Sunday morning when calling it. More specifically, there’s a delay in reporting, with snarking all around. One of the more notorious fights over first in recent memory was the weekend of Sept. 29-Oct. 1, 2017 when the opening of Tom Cruise’s American Made, the fourth weekend of It, and the second weekend of Kingsman: The Golden Circle were all ranking in the high $16M range. Kingsman won with $16.935M.
Turtles is a huge win for the Brian Robbins Paramount administration, particularly as he builds out and revives franchises.
Said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s domestic distribution boss, “We’re over the moon with this opening. We exceeded pre-release expectations with this movie, which has been a labor of love for a long time.”
The decision to revive Turtles happened back in 2018, when Robbins was at Nickelodeon with Ramsey Naito, current president, Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation, and they sparked to the idea of Seth Rogen’s involvement, as well as filmmaker Jeff Rowe — both lifelong fans — who truly wanted to lean into the ‘teenage’ part of the IP. Paramount, like all their movies this year, has gotten behind promoting the animated pic 200%, having Rogen show off extended footage at CineamCon, and a work-in-progress cut at Annecy back in June. Props to Paramount: They were the only studio who realized that there would be a full-house crowd down at San Diego Comic-Con: fans unfazed by the strikes. So they took Turtles down to Hall H and showed off more footage to fans with Rowe in tow, as well as TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman — the latter who just stoked the crowd. Why skip an opportunity? Very smart on the Melrose lot for being fearless and creative sans stars in their promotion. Rival studios, take note.

The second animated take of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak audience score of 88% positive and a 70% recommend, with kids under 12 giving it 94%, and a 69% must-see. That’s enough ooze to keep chugging into the fall. That’s on top of the pic’s already “A” CinemaScore. Men showing up at 60% to women’s 40%, with 56% of the crowd between 18-34. The biggest demo is 18-24 at 34%. Diversity demos are 33% Caucasian, a great 33% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black, and 16% Asian/other. The South Central and the West are the most robust here for the Nickelodeon/Point Grey production. Oppenheimer still has Imax, but the Turtles have PLFs, which are driving 16% of ticket sales and another 11% from 3D. Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing movie theater in the nation at $103K-plus so far. Cowabunga.
TMNT:MM saw Canada delivering 5% of the gross with major markets that over-indexed being L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin, while the only major markets that under-indexed were Seattle and Toronto. Top theaters came from L.A., N.Y., Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, Pharr, Texas, El Paso, Nashville, San Antonio, and Houston.
Social media analytics corp RelishMix says that Turtles’ social media universe is 309.8M across Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok combined. Ahead of release, RelishMix said those stats were under family animated averages. But clearly there’s an appetite here for the movie, as it’s greatly over-performing.

PostTrak audiences gave Meg 2 72% in the top two boxes, with a 55% recommend, and a B- to the first chapter’s B+. South Central and South are the biggest-grossing regions. Note, there’s a lot of walk-up business here, like there was on the first movie, from the Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who are showing up at 25% to Caucasian 41%, Black 15%, and Asian American at 13%. Warners does have some PLFs for the shark that are shared with the Turtles, accounting for 22.5% of the overall gross with another 18% coming from 3D screens. The Regal Fresno Riverpark is leading the pack with $39K in gross (including early shows) so far.
RelishMix counts a social media universe for the sequel of 350.8M, 14% above genre averages next to action-adventure sci-fi titles, with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on the high end at 611.3M SMU. “Chatter flows positive on The Meg 2, which makes new waves as the audacious, over-the-top shark sequel being hailed as a high-octane escape into ‘stupid-crazy-fun entertainment’ with endless positive snarky threads. The return of Jason Statham draws a splash as fans gush, ‘Looks amazing, especially with Jason Statham in this epic shark movie.'” reports RelishMix.
Jason Statham, who counts 111M fans on social media, got this modest plug in for the film on Instagram before the SAG-AFTRA strikes began:

Warner Bros
FRIDAY MIDDAY: The third weekend of Warner Bros’ Barbie at $51M (-45%) is higher than the opening of the Brad Pitt action movie, Bullet Train, which did $30M during the first weekend of August. It just goes to show how far we’ve come along at the box office. The Greta Gerwig directed take on the Mattel doll is eyeing a third Friday of $16M at 4,178 theaters, -45% from a week ago. Running total by Sunday will be $457.4M.
Universal’s Oppenheimer will hold on to third place at 3,612 theaters with a $7.8M third Friday (-42%), and third weekend of $27M, -42%, sending its running total by Sunday to $226.8M. Pic is director Christopher Nolan’s fourth highest domestic besting Batman Begins and Dunkirk. It’s also the highest grossing R-rated film of 2023 domestically ahead of John Wick Chapter 4 ($187.1M). Oppenheimer also reps the fastest Universal R-rated release to cross $200M in U.S./Canada, taking 15 days. Previous R-rated $200M Uni champ was 2012’s Ted, which took 37 days to that benchmark.
Third at 3,858 theaters is Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with a first Friday of $8.5M, 3-day of $27M, and 5-day of $42M, well ahead of its $30M-$40M expectations. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is 94% to go along with that A CinemaScore.
Warner Bros‘ The Meg 2: The Trench at 3,503 theaters is a seeing an $11M Friday, including previews, and a $25M opening — robust for the marketplace. Audiences are so-so on it so far at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s better than the 43% the first movie notched with RT crowds.
Disney’s second weekend of The Haunted Mansion at 3,740 is seeing a second estimated Friday of $2.8M,-72%, second weekend of $9.5M, -60%, for a running total of $42.5M.
FRIDAY AM: Barbie Crosses $400M, Oppenheimer Nears $200M, Turtles 2-day $15M, Meg 2 Previews $3M+ The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.’ Barbie, after a $11.8M Thursday, jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in her 14th day –faster than Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie– with a running total of $406.4M at 4,337 locations.
She’s poised to make around $55M in her third weekend, with Oppenheimer ringing in at least another $23M+; all of this spelling for a 3-day box office marketplace that will be exceedingly well north of last year’s $92M for the first weekend of August. The Christopher Nolan-directed movie earned $5.58M yesterday at 3,647 theaters taking its two-week total to $199.86M.
Warner Bros. also has some lagniappe at the weekend box office with The Meg 2: The Trench which is expected to do between $20M-$30M. Last night from previews that began at 3PM, the shark sequel did $3.2M at 3,400 locations. That’s a pretty good result for a sequel that stars a shark: The first Jason Statham movie brought in $4M in previews before churning out a $16.6M Friday, and $45.4M opening off what was a very campy, satirical marketing campaign. The $129M costing Meg 2 has a 50% stake from China’s CMC. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes loathe the sequel at 28% worse than the first movie back in 2018 at 45%. It’s a popcorn film for the masses, not for the tweeds.
Meanwhile, Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem saw its 2-day box office rise to $15M. Thursday was $4.87M at 3,513, -52% from Wednesday, with the Jeff Rowe-directed animated movie ranking third for the day.

Disney’s Haunted Mansion ranked fourth on Thursday with an estimated $1.6M at 3,740, -10% from Wednesday for a first week take of $33M. The previous Eddie Murphy 2003 movie opened on a Wednesday over Thanksgiving and its first seven days grossed $35.4M (unadjusted for inflation).
Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom booked at 3,411, did $1.47M yesterday, -6%, for a running four week total of $156.4M.
A24’s horror movie Talk to Me at 2,340 theaters did an estimated $1.2M yesterday for a first week of $15.8M. Granted, this title went wide versus A24’s Bodies Bodies Bodies last summer, which platformed, but it’s great to note that this Sundance acquisition has outstripped that Pete Davidson horror comedy’s total stateside cume of $11.4M. Talk to Me‘s first seven days are also 22% ahead of Midsommar‘s which stood at $13M and finaled at $27.4M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back! This time in a brand new movie, with comedy legend Seth Rogen producing and writing.
In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, everyone’s favourite heroes in a half-shell return, after years of being sheltered from the human world, and they are intent on winning the hearts of New Yorkers and becoming accepted as normal teenagers through their heroic acts. However, when their pal April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, they end up over their heads.
Regarding taking on the project, huge TNTM fan Seth Rogen told FM104: “It is kind of a dream come true. And it's one of those things that young me would be pretty psyched to know that future him, despite, you know, having a terrible back problem for the most part, also gets to work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!”
He added: “‘So, being in your 40s, there's good and bad things’, I would tell young Seth. ‘But overall, it's pretty exciting’.”
Seth, who also features in the film alongside John Cena, as Rocksteady and Bebop, continued: “A lot of the characters in the movie are inspired by the toys that me and Jeff [Rowe], the director, had. Like Mondo Gecko was not a very significant part of the show, or anything like that. But the toy was always one of our favourite toys.”
The film features the voices of Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon as the four turtles. Knocked Up and Superbad legend Rogen said: “We would have them improvise most of their lines. And we would encourage them to really speak over one another and interrupt one another and be as disrespectful to one another’s conversation as you would be with your brothers, who you're with all the time.
“The first recording session we had, I remember going to the director and the other producers and being like, ‘Oh, we have to record them to capture this energy that they actually have with each other, which is insane’.”
The voice cast also includes the likes of Rose Byrne and Maya Rudolph from Bridesmaids, as well as Stath Lets Flats’ Natasia Demetriou, Ant-Man’s Paul Rudd, and the legendary Jackie Chan. Of the latter, Rogen said: “I'm obsessed with Jackie Chan and I genuinely think he's, like, the greatest living comedian today. And so, the fact that he said ‘yes’ and is in the movie, and I got to work with him and be a part of those sessions and feed him lines and see him improvise and things like that, it's really surreal.”

Speaking with ComicBook, Eastman spoke about the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin video game and whether there was any chance of it being adapted to live-action in the near future.
“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t wanna take The Last Ronin concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman said. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”
What is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin?
Written by Eastman, Tom Waltz, and Peter Laird and illustrated by Ben Bishop, Esau Escorza, and Isaac Escorza, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin is a five-issue miniseries published by IDW in 2020. The series is set in a futuristic, war-torn world where all but one of the Ninja Turtles have been killed. The sole surviving turtle, whose identity is kept secret until the end of the series’ first issue, then embarks on a revenge mission to take down Shredder’s grandson.
While it may not be getting a live-action adaptation anytime soon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin is getting a sequel from IDW that launches in December 2023. A release date for the Last Ronin video game has not yet been set.
Additionally, the turtles are making their way to theaters when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which is directed by Jeff Rowe and co-written by Seth Rogen, releases on Aug. 2, 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL2NvbWljcy81NDI3NTctdG1udHMta2V2aW4tZWFzdG1hbi1jb21tZW50cy1vbi1wb3NzaWJpbGl0eS1vZi1hLWxhc3Qtcm9uaW4tbGl2ZS1hY3Rpb24tYWRhcHRhdGlvbtIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXBlcmhlcm9oeXBlLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvNTQyNzU3LXRtbnRzLWtldmluLWVhc3RtYW4tY29tbWVudHMtb24tcG9zc2liaWxpdHktb2YtYS1sYXN0LXJvbmluLWxpdmUtYWN0aW9uLWFkYXB0YXRpb24vYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Then, the trio reviews The Retrievals, a five-part narrative podcast hosted by Susan Burton for the New York Times and Serial Productions that chronicles the systematic ways American health care continually denies, discounts, and ignores women’s pain through a series of events that unfolded at the Yale Fertility Clinic. Finally, they are joined by Wesley Morris, critic at large at the New York Times, to discuss his tour de force essay, “How Hip-Hop Conquered the World,” and how the history of the radical art form is as porous and complex as the nation itself.
In the exclusive Slate Plus segment, the panel commemorates hip-hop’s 50th anniversary with a lightning round of personal accounts about their first encounters with the form.

One gem she found was The Year of the Horse, a concert documentary recorded live in 1990 at Forest National, Brussels. It’s a fantastic snapshot of a live performance at a very specific time in O’Connor’s life.

Thanks to the nature of the medium, actors in animation don't have to be in the same room together to share a scene. In most productions, actors' voices are recorded and edited ahead of time, and the animators add their physical acting after the fact. It's typically more common for animated productions to record each of their actors separately, then edit together a vocal track before the animation begins. Indeed, if one has ever seen a behind-the-scenes video of voice actors in a booth, one might see how recording lines can become very tedious as actors will have to repeat single lines over and over again until the director hears a take they like. It's quite rare for actors to play out entire scenes the way they appear in a final animated product.
In certain television shows over the years, however, that practice has been eschewed. Some producers prefer their actors retain their ability to play off each other, reacting in real-time, talking over each other, and generally lending a more natural performance to the show in question. This was famously done for shows like ""Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,"" ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""The Powerpuff Girls,"" and ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" all of which liked to gather as much of their cast as possible into one recording booth.
In movies, entire-cast recordings are all but unheard of, save for a few notable pairings. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, for instance, recorded their lines together for ""Toy Story,"" as did John Goodman and Billy Crystal for ""Monsters, Inc."" Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro shared a booth for ""Shark Tale."" And, according to a recent behind-the-scenes interview with executive producer Seth Rogen, the four lead actors of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (in theaters August 2) did the same.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vMTM0MTk4Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tcmVjb3JkZWQtdG9nZXRoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-05 15:28:37+00:00,"Movie review: ‘Mutant Mayhem’ a fresh, authentic take on the ninja turtles","The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.","Radioactive ooze generated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” has helped birth “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the new animated feature about everyone’s favorite rambunctious, pizza-loving reptiles. Directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears showcase the turtles in a way we’ve never seen them before, utilizing a blend of 3D and 2D animation to create a unique, rough-hewn (on purpose) style that suggests children’s book illustrations blended with teenage sketchbooks.
That edgy look is paired with a script that’s funny and fresh, a soundtrack filled with classic New York hip-hop, and a stunning industrial score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
It’s clear that Rowe, Spears and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (who also produced the film), Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit and Brendan O’Brien, have a deep love and nostalgia for these lovable ‘80s relics, who were ubiquitous in the childhoods of older millennials. These sewer-dwelling rapscallions, raised and trained by a rat named Splinter, were born on the pages of a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. There were toys, a memorable Saturday morning cartoon, and three live-action movies back in the 1990s (who could forget the refrain sung by Vanilla Ice: “go ninja, go ninja, go!”). But the less said about the film adaptations in the 2010s, the better.
‘Mutant Mayhem’ is both a new direction for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a return to the past, symbolically, locating the material in the land of teenage imagination, memory, nostalgia and emotion. The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.
The color palette is dark with pops of neon, giving it an early ‘90s look. Sprinkled throughout are video clips that nod to the cultural touchstones of the creators: snippets of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” a salute to John Hughes, to whose vision of American high school the teen turtles cling, and instructional karate training videos, which is how Splinter (Jackie Chan) teaches his young turtle sons to defend themselves against the terrifying outside world.
The creators get back to basics with the story, focusing on the question of fathers and sons, mutants existing within humanity and the universal desire for acceptance. Splinter, a New York City street rat, is already inured to human rejection when he adopts the four adorable turtles covered in radioactive ooze. He raises them in a loving environment, away from the hustle and bustle (and malice) of the city, and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), grow up in a tight-knit quartet, though they long to be part of the world.
On the other hand is supervillain Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who doesn’t hide from humanity, but harbors genocidal impulses toward the people who have deemed his and his mutant brethren unacceptable. He wants to make every creature on earth a mutant, tipping the balance of power away from the humans and toward the mutants, believing it the only way they’ll find their place in the world.
With the help of intrepid reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the turtles decide to stop Superfly in the hopes that if they’re seen as heroes, they’ll be celebrated and integrated into society in order to fulfill their dream of going to high school (they’re teenagers, they’ve got teenage dreams).
The themes are broad and universal but the writing is remarkable — the dialogue feels natural and authentic to the age group, and it’s filled with modern slang and references to pop culture, rap songs, anime, comedy and more. Their desire for community is a resonant message, but it’s expressed in layered dialogue that feels like the way real teens talk to each other, and it’s beautifully performed by the four actors voicing the turtles.
The filmmakers manage to balance the contemporary feel of the writing and innovative visual style with their own nostalgia for childhood cultural touchstones, which makes “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a fascinating and highly entertaining blend of old and new.

The Turtles are back in the animated movie Mutant Mayhem, an origin story where the TMNT have to save New York City from the mutant creature Superfly.
The star-studded movie boasts an impressive cast and crew. It's produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and features the voices of The Bear's Ayo Edebiri, Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito, WWE legend John Cena and Marvel's Paul Rudd.

The Turtles in Time mini-arcade offers multiplayer options for up to four people, and the cabinet itself is crafted from real wood. The design and even button combinations mirror the 1991 arcade version.
In Turtles in Time, you can choose to control any of the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they travel through time to battle legendary enemies such as Krang and the Super Shredder.

2023-08-08 13:09:31+00:00,"'Mutant Mayhem 2' Villain Confirmed, Other Iconic Characters May Also Appear - Inside the Magic",Expect some very familiar faces in 'Mutant Mayhem 2'.,"Which iconic villains will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is currently entertaining audiences of all ages in movie theaters and has opened to glowing reviews and impressive box office figures ($51.6 million worldwide to date, against a $70 million budget).
The film has an impressive assortment of heroes and villains, but it’s the latter that boasts the most where A-list actors are concerned. There’s Seth Rogen (Bebop), John Cena (Rocksteady), Rose Byrne (Leatherhead), Ice Cube (Superfly), Paul Rudd (Mondo Gecko), and Giancarlo Esposito (Baxter Stockman), to name a few. But with the exception of Bebop and Rocksteady, Mutant Mayhem is missing some major iconic villains.

In an interview with Den of Geek at San Diego Comic-Con, Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe talked about where things might go in the next movie, which, looking at the critical reception for the current film and, more importantly, the box office takings, is inevitable.
“I think a lot of people are gonna want more,” Rowe said. “These characters are so wonderful, this casting is so wonderful, you just love spending time with them. The Turtles’ world is a big one. There’s a lot left to explore. Conversations are happening, and it would be really exciting to let these characters keep on living and breathing.”
One of those conversations is undoubtedly centered around the Turtles’ iconic arch nemesis.

Warning: there are major spoilers ahead for Mutant Mayhem!

During a mid-credits scene, the Ninja Turtles, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), are adjusting to life at Eastman High with their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri).

However, it’s revealed that TCRI head Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who earlier in the film failed to extract the Ninja Turtles’ mutagen-blood to create an army of mutant soldiers, has surveillance on our half-shell heroes. Before the scene ends, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder, who we see standing in the dark near Brooklyn Bridge.

In a recent interview with SFX magazine, when discussing whether or not The Shredder will show up in Mutant Mayhem 2, Rowe jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger), who was missing from the first film in the series, Batman Begins (2005).

Fans hungry for another slice of Ninja Turtles won’t need to wait long, though. Paramount has already greenlit a 2D animated series for Paramount+ later this year, titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2023), that will follow on from Mutant Mayhem, as part of a planned TMNT shared universe.

The mid-credits scene confirms that The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2. He may even show up in the 2D animated series, but it’s likely Nickelodeon will want to save the silver samurai for the silver screen.

While The Shredder is a somewhat exhausted villain, we’ve no doubt that the “Mutant Mayhem-verse” will offer a fresh take on the character, just as the first film has done with its roster of mutants. But which other iconic villains from the wider TMNT universe do we need to see in the sequel?

The Shredder

Many fans would argue that you can’t have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (or show) without The Shredder, the franchise’s most iconic villain. But Oroku Saki was actually killed off in the first volume of the original Mirage Studios comic books in the ’80s.

Be that as it may, the 1987 cartoon series immortalized the character, as he went on to appear in numerous iterations on the small screen, in comic books, video games, and four out of seven of the theatrical movies (not counting Mutant Mayhem‘s mid-credits scene).

Now that we know The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2, it’s high time for something very different. While the Michael Bay-produced 2014 live-action film gave us a “Transformer” version of the character, we’re hoping for something a bit more subtle.

Related: All 12 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Explained (Yes, 12!)

The Foot

You can’t have The Shredder without the Foot (known also as the Foot Clan or the Foot Soldiers). His legion of ninja followers are often depicted as wearing black bodysuits to blend in with the dark, and with large, bug-like eyes on their masks (a bit like Spider-Man).

The Foot are hardly the front and center of TMNT‘s extensive rogues gallery, but they’re just as iconic as The Shredder, largely because they’re so heavily associated with him. Assuming Mutant Mayhem‘s version of The Shredder is a ninja, then the Foot are a no-brainer.

In the mid-credits scene, we only see the side of The Shredder’s helmet, and the spikes on his shoulder pad. He certainly looks like a ninja, but whether or not he’s Oroku Saki remains to be seen. But as Splinter (Jackie Chan) isn’t the Hamato Yoshi version, who shares a history with Saki, it’s unlikely.

Krang

For many fans, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) remains a bit of a mystery. This is understandable, because Mutant Mayhem doesn’t reveal much about her, other than the fact she heads up TCRI, and wants the Turtles’ blood to create super-soldiers.

In the mid-credits scene, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder to help her capture the Turtles now that they’re in high school and surrounded by people, as opposed to living in the shadows. But who is Cynthia Utrom?

Well, we know the word “Utrom” is the name given to Krang’s species — yes, the Krang, from the many cartoons and comic books and live-action movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) — and we know that they love to make mutant armies.

Cynthia Utrom’s human form is probably a robot, with a Krang operating from the inside, who is most likely female, especially when you consider that the mutants Leatherhead (Rose Byrne) and Wingnut (Natasha Demetriou) are female versions of past iterations.

Baxter Stockman

While Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) already appears in Mutant Mayhem’s opening sequence, there’s plenty of room for him to appear in the sequel. The tricky part is that Stockman is (apparently) killed before the opening credits, but he could always show up in a flashback sequence, or some kind video diary footage.

The sequel may even reveal that Superfly (Ice Cube) is the same person as Baxter Stockman. In previous iterations of TMNT, Baxter is Superfly, as part of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like mutation storyline, however, in Mutant Mayhem, both characters are entirely separate. As far as we’re told anyway, as Superfly’s hair looks suspiciously similar to Baxter’s.

Casey Jones

We know what you’re thinking: Casey Jones isn’t a villain. But Mutant Mayhem doesn’t appear to be following the TMNT playbook all that much. For starters, most of its mutant characters were born as animals, such as Superfly, Bebop, and Rocksteady, whereas in previous iterations they are humans who are transformed into mutant animals.

And don’t get us started on all the lore the film completely ignores, from Splinter’s backstory with The Shredder, which seems to have been thrown out of the window, to the fact that the Ninja Turtles end up in high school. A bold and admirable direction, for sure, but loyal to the TMNT mythology this film ain’t. This could work in its favors, though.

Casey Jones, the hockey stick-wielding vigilante, could be introduced a villain, which would create an interesting dynamic between Casey and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and in turn, the Ninja Turtles.

It’s no stretch to say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has always been a diverse franchise. 1997 saw the first female Turtle, Venus de Milo, in the live-action television series Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (1997).

Since then, there have been even more female Turtles in the long-running IDW Publishing comic book series, from human-turned-Turtle Jennika to the more recent Moja and Yi, who form part of the new line-up in the ongoing “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) series.

Now, the CG-animated reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is set to be just as diverse. Not only is April O’Neil portrayed as African-American (voiced by African-American actress Ayo Edebiri), two TMNT villains are portrayed by female actors.

Those villains are mutant alligator Leatherhead and alien-in-human-form Cynthia Utrom, voiced by Bridesmaids (2011) duo Rose Byrne and Maya Rudolph, respectively. The long-standing character of Leatherhead has previously been portrayed as male in the many TMNT iterations, while Cynthia Utrom appears to be a version of the male villain Krang.

Related: What Is the New Female ‘Ninja Turtles’ Sequel About?

Now, we finally have our first look at both of these characters in a new promotional video titled “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — The New Turtles,” in which producer Seth Rogen name-drops all the film’s characters and the actors who play them.

While we only see a still image of Cynthia Utrom (which is part of a series of newly revealed character posters for the film), we see Leatherhead in action, with Rose Byrne’s native Aussie accent, as she says, “G’day, fellas!”

These villains might not be anywhere near as iconic as the likes of Bebop and Rocksteady (who are voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena in the upcoming film), but between this new change-up and the two new female Turtles in “The Last Ronin,” we could end up with an all-female TMNT movie one day.

,Post Malone Is Playing a Mutant Sting Ray in TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,"The Dallas music legend has been cast by producer, writer and co-star Seth Rogen as the human manta-ray mutant known as Ray Fillet.","There's a certain hierarchy or ladder that musicians have to climb to achieve the ultra-rare movie star/musician status, and Post Malone is on his way to the top rung.It goes like this: First (and this is the hardest part), you have to become a chart-topping musical megastar. Post Malone has already checked that box with eight diamond singles , surpassing Bruno Mars' record last April, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In fact, he's triple- checked, filled in the box completely and even circled it several times with a red Sharpie. So that's covered.Then you have to go on TV a lot, which is easy to do when you've broken RIAA records and received Grammy nominations and such. You go on late-night shows, reality shows or even comedy shows. Hell, you don't have to do most of the work on that one. They come to you. Posty's done that with shows such as, where he went on a day-drinking trip with the satirical comedian, and more recently, Post Malone helped play pranks on the public on Impractical Jokers Then and only then can you achieve the first step on the path to movie stardom, and Post Malone is a month away from completing that task. He's been cast as one of the many villains in Paramount Pictures' animated comedy adventurepremieringon Aug. 4.The newmovie, written and produced by Seth Rogen, is finally taking pop culture's most famous reptile assassins down the comedy route it desperately needed since Michael Bay took over the franchise. The less said about, the better.Everything from the stop-motion-ish animation style to the cavalcade of characters approach to storytelling brings the Turtles back to their afternoon cartoon roots. The film is basically turning the characters into anotherminus the LEGOS. Instead of just having the Turtles fight their arch nemesis Master Shredder, Rogen and company are throwing pretty much every villain at them. Posty has been cast to play the human-manta ray hybrid Ray Fillet. We even get a little taste of how he might approach the character in this extended trailer.Ray Fillet is one of those characters who didn't get a lot of time in the original cartoon and zero time in the movies. In fact, he's more known for being a mutant in some of thecomic book spinoff series in the 1990s who flirts between friend and enemy from story to story. And he's one of the toy line's most sought-after action figures.According to IGN , Ray is a former marine biologist who got exposed to that pesky mutagen while investigating a toxic waste dump. His DNA fused with a manta ray who happened to be in the vicinity, and you know the rest. It's a tale as old as time, if time started in 1990.Having a character who's not as well known as the brutish Bebop and Rocksteady or Baxter Stockman means Post will have a lot of room to play around with the character and build up a personality for the new movie. In other words, we're about to get a prime dose of mutated Posty that you'll be able to inject directly into your veins come early August. If anybody can play a sing-songy, fighting manta ray, it's Post Malone.The role may already be paying off for Post Malone. According to IMDB, Posty has two more upcoming roles in two separate film productions. He's been cast in an upcoming Christmas comedy calledthat also stars Jack Black and Keegan-Michael Key (and Jack Black better be playing Santa) and as a narrator in a short film calledwhich has something to do with continental drift. He may or may not also be a talking manta ray in the latter.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc29ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9hcnRzL3Bvc3QtbWFsb25lLWlzLXBsYXlpbmctYS12aWxsYWluLWluLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS0xNjkwNTg0N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The highly-stylized take on the Ninja Turtles represents the fourth swing at a theatrical franchise and the seventh installment to be released in movie theaters.

Inspired by movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a new generation of ambitious animated movies like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have started to seep into the blockbuster space, giving a cool, tactile update to properties that had previously been fairly by-the-numbers in terms of their style, even when the scripts themselves were strong.

""We wanted it to be like Stand By Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" director Jeff Rowe described. ""They've got a lot of that inauthentic confidence that teenagers have: when you're a teen, you don't know any better, so you operate with this hyped-up sense of, 'We can do anything!' That's something that [they] are great at – that Superbad thing where they're best friends, but they're kinda losers who make fun of each other, but you never doubt for a second that they truly love each other.""

According to the film's official synopsis, ""In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O'Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.""

Teenage Mutans Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem stars Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, and Brady Noon Raphael. The cast also includes Hannibal Buress as Genghis Frog, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, John Cena as Rocksteady, Jackie Chan as Splinter, Ice Cube as Superfly, Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Post Malone as Ray Fillet, Seth Rogen as Bebop, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, and Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom.

Movies are pretty cool, huh? Unfortunately, the summer movie season has likely peaked with the dual release of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" But there are still plenty of intriguing new releases in August, from a reboot of a beloved '80s property to a pair of raunchy comedies that could make for your next great double feature.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (Aug. 2)

Cowabunga! The ninja turtles are back for their first animated movie in more than 15 years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" following two live-action Michael Bay films. ""After years of being sheltered from the human world,"" the turtles set out to ""win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,"" per Paramount. Seth Rogen worked on the screenplay and voices Bebop, and the rest of the voice cast includes John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The turtles also have a new look, as the film's art style is reminiscent of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" With great turtle power comes great turtle responsibility.

""Meg 2: The Trench"" (Aug. 4)

What better way to close out the summer than with a big, dumb shark movie? Jason Statham returns in this sequel to ""The Meg,"" the 2018 surprise hit that saw him gloriously face off against a megalodon shark. This time, he and Wu Jing ""lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean,"" which ""spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival,"" per Warner Bros. It's based on the follow-up to the original novel, and the screenwriters from the first movie are back, though there's a new director: Ben Wheatley, the filmmaker known for disturbing horror movies like ""Kill List."" Hopefully, the sequel hasn't bitten off more than it can chew.

""Shortcomings"" (Aug. 4)

Randall Park has long been a delightful on-screen presence, but he's now ready to get behind the camera. Variety described Park's new dramedy ""Shortcomings"" as a ""fresh-faced, funny directorial debut"" for the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" star. From Sony Pictures Classics, the movie follows a struggling filmmaker, Ben (Justin H. Min), and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), who works for an Asian American film festival. ""When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want,"" the synopsis says. Sherry Cola stars as Ben's best friend Alice. Sony also described Ben as a man who ""spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women"" and ""watching Criterion Collection DVDs."" Wait, is this play about us?

""Heart of Stone"" (Aug. 11)

Gal Gadot's future as Wonder Woman may be in doubt, but if that gig falls through, at least she's got a home in the Netflix ecosystem. After starring in the streamer's ""Red Notice,"" Gadot returns for another Netflix original film that she also produced, the spy thriller ""Heart of Stone,"" in which she plays secret agent Rachel Stone. She's the ""only intelligence operative who stands between her global, peace-keeping organization and the loss of its most valuable — and dangerous — asset, codenamed: The Heart,"" per Netflix. Jamie Dornan also stars. Director Tom Harper told Entertainment Weekly the aim is for the film to spawn a new female-led action series like James Bond. In its attempt to craft more original franchises, Netflix is leaving no stone unturned.

""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" (Aug. 11)

If ""Renfield"" got you in the mood for more Dracula on the big screen, Universal has another movie for you. From ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" director André Øvredal, ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is based on a chapter from the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" novel, ""The Captain's Log,"" in which Dracula travels on board a merchant ship and things don't end well for those aboard. ""Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship,"" per Universal. Think of it as ""Alien,"" but on a boat and with Dracula instead of a Xenomorph. Corey Hawkins and Liam Cunningham star, and Javier Botet plays Dracula. With their help, for now, the Universal monsters franchise is alive.

""Gran Turismo"" (Aug. 11)

The race to find the next great video game movie is shifting gears with ""Gran Turismo."" David Harbour and Orlando Bloom star in this film based on the popular racing video games, though it's not a direct adaptation of them. Instead, it's inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, who became an actual race car driver after playing the video game competitively. The stakes are high for director Neill Blomkamp, who has struggled to follow up his critically-acclaimed debut film, 2009's ""District 9;"" his last two movies, ""Chappie"" and ""Demonic,"" were both widely panned. Can bringing a racing game to the big screen get his career back on track?

""Blue Beetle"" (Aug. 18)

The end of the DC universe as we know it is in sight, but it's not quite over yet. The DC Extended Universe still has two more films left before new boss James Gunn reboots the franchise. First up is ""Blue Beetle,"" in which a young college graduate, played by Xolo Maridueña, ""unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,"" which ""chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host,"" leading him to become the superhero Blue Beetle, per Warner Bros. Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first character of the new DC universe, suggesting he could stick around even after the upcoming reboot. But that likely depends on how well this film performs, as if it's another DC bomb, expect the character to be tossed aside as quickly as Ezra Miller's Flash.

""Strays"" (Aug. 18)

In June, Jennifer Lawrence did her part to keep comedies alive in theaters with ""No Hard Feelings,"" and ""Strays"" is now picking up the torch. This new comedy produced by ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller has a unique hook: it's a filthy, R-rated film starring a bunch of talking dogs. The pups ""hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie,"" a Border Terrier voiced by Will Ferrell, ""find his way home"" and make his ""lowlife owner"" pay for abandoning him. Jamie Foxx and Will Forte also flesh out the voice cast, and Dennis Quaid appears in the movie as himself. Will this barking dog comedy have bite?

""Bottoms"" (Aug. 25)

Two of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood today are Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri, but fans introduced to them though ""Shiva Baby"" and ""The Bear"" may not realize the two collaborated in 2020 on the digital shorts ""Ayo and Rachel Are Single."" Three years later, they're teaming back up for the raunchy sex comedy ""Bottoms,"" in which two girls ""start a fight club as a way to lose their virginities to cheerleaders,"" per MGM. Emma Seligman directed the film in her follow-up to ""Shiva Baby,"" and Sennott co-wrote it with Seligman. Marshawn Lynch also stars. The movie earned near universal acclaim at South by Southwest, with Mashable's Kristy Puchko calling it a ""ruthless and hysterical parody of the teen sex comedy."" This is one fight club everyone will be talking about.

""Retribution"" (Aug. 25)

We've got five words for you: ""Speed,"" but with Liam Neeson. If you're not already on board, you should be. The actor leads this new action-thriller in which a man receives a call from a mysterious person who tells him there's a bomb under his car seat. The caller demands he ""complete a specific series of tasks,"" and with ""his kids trapped in the back seat and a bomb that will explode if they get out of the car, a normal commute becomes a twisted game of life or death,"" per Lionsgate. Nimród Antal, the filmmaker behind 2010's ""Predators,"" directs, and Jack Champion and Matthew Modine also star. Following new blockbusters starring Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, it's the perfect conclusion to the summer of aging action stars proving they've still got it.

2023-07-03 12:00:51+00:00,New 'TMNT' Installment Finally Replaces Original Four Heroes - Inside the Magic,The new 'TMNT' installment isn't all that interested in the original half-shell heroes...,"The latest TMNT installment has just been released, and it’s finally broken new ground for the franchise.

“TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) made waves when it first arrived back in 2020, becoming a critical and financial hit, storming to the top of The New York Times best-sellers list, and transforming the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise forever.

The story finds the lone surviving Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo, embarking on a one-way mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter, in a futuristic and dystopian New York City.

Now, fans are poring over the second, five-part series “The Lost Years” (2023), the prequel/sequel to “The Last Ronin”, which expands upon “the lost years” that precede Michelangelo’s long-awaited return to New York, while also introducing the Turtles’ “replacements.”

The end of the first series sees Michelangelo successfully avenge the deaths of his three brothers after a bloody battle against New York City dictator Oroku Hiroto (The Shredder’s grandson). However, he is also fatally wounded in the fight.

But the final scene reveals that April O’Neil’s daughter, Casey Marie, a pivotal figure in the rebellion against Oroku Hiroto, has started to raise four baby mutant turtles in the original Ninja Turtles’ sewer lair, and this is where “The Lost Years” picks up.

It would be a lie to say that the current series is split halfway down the middle where its prequel/sequel commitments are concerned. Any focus on the four new turtles, Odyn, Moja, Yi, and Uno, is limited to only a handful of panels in each issue.

Related: Will the Live-Action ‘Ninja Turtles’ Reboot Be All-Female?!

But this isn’t a criticism — undoubtedly, the creators are drip-feeding these new characters into our lives without shifting the focus from Michelangelo entirely. The last original Ninja Turtle will most likely be gone forever once this series ends.

Each issue leaps forward three years, so by the time we arrive at Issue #4, the new turtles are, as the story describes, “pre-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But unlike the previous three issues, they’re now finally being trained on how to fight by their sensei, Casey Marie.

While their scene in the latest TMNT installment is just as fleeting as those in previous issues, it’s great to finally see them in action, even if the fight does turn out to be nothing more than a simulation, with Casey preparing them for the real world above.

It’s also likely that the final issue, which releases in late July, will feature more from them, which makes sense given that “The Lost Day,” a one-shot comic that hits shelves in late August, will follow these them in their entirety, as they officially replace the original Ninja Turtles.

IDW Publishing’s main “TMNT” comic book series is still ongoing. At the same time “The Last Ronin,” which takes place in an alternate timeline, is also set to continue, as co-creator Kevin Eastman previously confirmed that a third series is already in development.

But while the primary canon will continue, it seems fans are far more interested in “The Last Ronin.” Not only are waves of new toys based on the dark and gritty comic book series hitting shelves, but a brand-new “AAA game” is in the works, which is said to be heavily inspired by the Gods of War game series.

As per IDW, here’s the synopsis for “The Last Ronin — Lost Years”:

RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In the smash-hit miniseries TMNT: The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time — past, present, future — to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half Shell. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heart-breaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artist Ben Bishop (TMNT: The Last Ronin) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of… Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

2023-08-05 00:20:18+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director credits Spider-Verse with opening the door to unique animation,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe credits Spider-Verse with opening the door to unique animation.,"When CG animation began to take hold following the release of Toy Story, there was a period where a lot of the movies looked quite similar. Little by little, the various animation studios added their own stylistic flourishes, but it wasn’t until the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse were it felt like there was a real mainstream departure from the previous style. Since the success of Spider-Verse, we’ve seen more animated movies embrace a unique style, including the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

While speaking with THR, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe credited Spider-Verse with giving them more confidence in their style. “ The first Spider-Verse really opened a lot of doors, ” Rowe said. “ It really made it okay for studios to take chances on a film looking unique and maybe having a little bit more sophistication and emotional maturity in its storytelling. And it was such a seismic shift that it became expected. Suddenly, making movies that look like the style of CG animation over the past 30 years felt dated. And so they really paved the way for what will hopefully be a huge generation of new filmmakers with very unique expressions. “

Jeff Rowe also didn’t want to make a “grounded” Ninja Turtles movie, with dark and gritty versions of the foursome.

There’s been a little bit of a trend with superhero films, and it probably really kicked off with Batman Begins, but it’s to take the preposterous elements of the franchise and the lore and make them black and tactical and grounded and whatever the realistic version is. And so we had thought about that early on, like, “Okay, how would you actually strap a sword to yourself and do these things?” And we were like, “That’s just not the Ninja Turtles. They’re wacky. The designs are silly. That playfulness is what I loved about it as a kid, so let’s embrace that. Let’s be really grounded with New York, and then in an environment like TCRI, let’s make it look like the Technodrome.” It’s a dated, aging technology environment anyway, so it kind of makes sense. And if we found a way to make the Pizza Van make sense, then there’s definitely room to make a Turtle Blimp make sense within our own internal logic.

“ After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts, ” reads the official synopsis for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. “ Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. “

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is the latest iteration of TMNT in film. But unlike previous entries, this time all the focus is on the teenage aspects of the Ninja Turtles, while the film is easily the most family-friendly of all seven.

So, fans hoping for a dark and gritty take on the half-shell heroes, particularly those who are familiar with the ongoing comic book series, “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) from IDW Publishing, may walk away understandably disappointed.

While Mutant Mayhem is heavily marketed towards younger audiences, none of the films, or the numerous television shows, are geared towards adults, save for the original film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). But even that is quite cheesy in retrospect.

A genuinely adult-themed Ninja Turtles reboot, whether it’s on the big screen or the small screen, would definitely need to take a page out of the comic books, whether it’s the original run from Mirage Studios in the ’80s, or “The Last Ronin”.

“The Last Ronin” takes place in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City, where an older Michelangelo embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter.

A second series titled “Lost Years” (2023) is currently available, and it was announced at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con that a third series titled “Re-Evolution” is in the works, with the first issue available from December. The Last Ronin game is also now in development.

Recently, in an interview with ComicBook.com, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman commented on the possibility of a movie adaptation of “The Last Ronin”, while also sharing some details about The Last Ronin game.

Here are his full comments:

“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take ‘The Last Ronin’ concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While The Last Ronin game sounds really exciting, unsurprisingly, when it comes to the big screen, Nickelodeon is clearly more focused on building a Mutant Mayhem shared universe. Not only has a sequel already been greenlit, a 2D animated follow-up series will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.

This isn’t great news for fans hoping for a live-action adaptation of The Last Ronin. Fortunately, The Last Ronin game will remedy some of that disappointment when it’s eventually released.

Either way, the popular comic book series is on the tip of everyone’s tongue, even when it comes to conversations about Mutant Mayhem. In an interview with YouTube channel Nerd Reactor, the brand-new Ninja Turtles actors were asked for their thoughts on “The Last Ronin.” Leonardo actor, Nicolas Cantu, who is clearly a fan of the comic books, was the first to respond, saying, “That is sick! That is sick!”

Brady Noon, who voices Raphael in the film, said to the interviewer, “You are the first person who has mentioned ‘The Last Ronin’!” before asking his co-stars, “Did you see the YouTube thing for it?”, referring to the popular fan film that imagines what a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” might look like.

The interviewer then put a question to Shamon Brown Jr. who voices Michelangelo, saying, “Let’s say, in the future, people love this [Mutant Mayhem], the reception is well, and people are like, ‘Oh man I want to see older Mikey deal with [the death of his brothers!'”

Here’s what the actor said in response: “I would be open to that, for sure. You know the voice gets deeper a little bit and, you know, has to get a bit more gruesome, but it’s going to be amazing. Hey, we’ll see. It could be five to ten years from now, you never know.”

“Are you going to miss us?” Cantu jokingly asked his co-star. “Cuz we’re gone in that storyline!”

While Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael are indeed dead at the time “The Last Ronin” takes place, they still appear in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, so there would certainly be room for Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey (Donatello) to appear alongside Shamon Brown Jr. They’d just need to be considerably older first.

Check out the interview below:

Even if The Last Ronin movie does eventually happen, it’s unlikely any of the Mutant Mayhem actors will ever end up reprising their roles, as Nickelodeon would likely want to keep the film as far from the Mutant Mayhem universe as possible. But who knows. One day, we could get a CG-animated Last Ronin movie as part of the “Mutant Mayhem-verse.”

Either way, who else could take on the role?

Who could play Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie?

Keanu Reeves

Keanu Reeves is no stranger to the martial arts, or taking down hordes of bad guys in neon-lit city settings as he sets out to exact vengeance upon a powerful enemy. If you’ve seen the John Wick films, you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Reeves’ gruff and somber voice would also be perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie.

Michael Shannon

Michael Shannon plays General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) and The Flash (2023), so he has plenty of experience with movies based on comic books. But it’s his role as Mr. Green in the comedy film The Night Before (2015) that oozes those “chilled out” Michelangelo vibes. More importantly, Shannon would bring a ton of grit to the role in The Last Ronin movie.

Chris Hemsworth

Chris Hemsworth also has experience with comic book movies as the God of Thunder, Thor, but we’re looking at his role as Tyler Rake in the Extraction films. Hemsworth also has the physique perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, and he’s also a great comedy actor, which would allow for the more “traditional” Mikey to surface from time to time.

Andy Serkis

Andy Serkis might not be the first actor you think of when casting a character like Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, or any Turtle for that matter. However, Serkis is the king of motion-capture performance, whether it’s Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, King Kong in Peter Jackson’s 2005 epic, or Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy.

Iko Uwais

Iko Uwais is hardly a household name in these parts of the world, but he might just be the most suited candidate for playing Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie. Uwais is best known for playing Rama in The Raid films, the adrenalin-charged Indonesian actioners. The actor’s mind-blowing fighting skills could prove an absolute game-changer .

Noel Fisher

There’s probably no better actor to play Michelangelo than, well, Michelangelo. It would seem unfair to give the character the motion-capture treatment again without considering Noel Fisher, who portrayed him in the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. The Last Ronin version of Mikey, however, would be very different to what you saw in those films.

These actors could even portray Michelangelo in The Last Ronin game, whether it’s through motion-capture performance or voice work. Unless Mutant Mayhem‘s Shamon Brown Jr. is confident about doing that deeper voice.

While there’s no film based on “The Last Ronin” in development, a trailer for The Last Ronin video game was released on Friday. Check it out below:

There’s no release date for The Last Ronin game. “The Last Ronin” comic books are all on sale now. The third series, “Re-Evolution”, goes on sale in December.

Mutant Mayhem is in theaters now. Check out the trailer below:

,TMNT Mutant Mayhem Found The Zombie Turtle Kid For The Best Viral Marketing Ever,"Remember the ""I like turtles"" kid? Well Paramount found him and implemented him into the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles marketing.","It’s been years since the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graced the big screen, but the superhero team is set to return next weekend with TMNT: Mutant Mayhem . As one of the next titles among 2023's new movie release dates prepares to hit theaters, Paramount has called upon a throwback meme to bring attention to its release, and the marketing idea is top tier.

Back in May 2007, 10-year-old Jonathan Ware went absolutely viral for appearing on a local news interview at the Rose Festival in Portland, Oregon. While in zombie makeup, a TV reporter turned the microphone to a kid attending the festivities to ask what he thought about the whole thing. He memorably responded with “I like turtles.” Over 16 years later, the marketing team behind the TMNT movie brought back the viral sensation for this bit:

Jonathan Ware is all grown up, in his mid-20s now, and yes, it is, in fact, the same Jonathan. He put the zombie makeup back on, and he got into character as his childhood self to say “I like turtles” to promote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. Obviously, the recreation of the now-classic internet meme is already going viral!

Commenters took to TikTok to react with things like “NO WAY!!!!!!!! He’s all grown up,” “living legend” and “This is something I never knew I needed.” Considering most memes like this live and die with a single video, it’s quite the welcome jump scare to see Jonathan Ware as an adult in the zombie makeup doing the meme years later. We have to wonder what his reaction was when he was approached by Paramount and how much the viral gentlemen got for helping promote the new TMNT movie. Since we’re getting nostalgic, check out the original video that started it all:

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Donatello and Leonardo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Release Date: August 2, 2023

Directed By: Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears

Written By: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg & Jeff Rowe

Starring: Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito, Maya Rudolph, Ice Cube, etc.

Rating: PG for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material

Runtime: 99 minutes

It’s pretty clever marketing on Paramount’s part ahead of the animated movie hitting theaters next weekend. Critics have also seen Mutant Mayhem and are loving it, with many saying the movie walks a nice line between being very nostalgic and a fresh take on the franchise. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise has been around since the early ‘80s, beginning as comic books before becoming a mainstay in toy sections and getting its own video games and beloved animated series. This latest movie sees Seth Rogen and his longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg putting their own spin on the franchise.

This year feels like it’s been an especially great year for studios stepping up their campaigns, especially on social media, between M3GAN ’s viral marketing efforts and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie inspiring people to wear pink outfits to theaters. You can look forward to the latest TMNT movie hitting theaters next Friday, August 2… if you like turtles, that is.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RtbnQtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1mb3VuZC16b21iaWUtMDAzODM4OTA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

(Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images) (Gilbert Flores via Getty Images)

Ayo Edebiri's history with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles goes way back to her childhood.

One of the breakout faces from exquisite kitchen drama The Bear, in which she plays Sydney Adamu, Edebiri will voice April O'Neil in the upcoming movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem - produced by none other than Seth Rogen.

Quizzed about her past connection to these anthropomorphic cartoon reptiles, the actress revealed to Den of Geek: ""I have maybe 50 cousins, and like 40 of them are boys, so growing up, I was very well-versed in Turtle culture.

""I actually showed Jeff [Rowe, director] and Seth my first skateboard. My skateboarding career is long over. But my first board was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles deck—it was a Michelangelo deck.

""So I was a big fan.""

In Mutant Mayhem, Edebiri's incarnation of April is one of the first humans to get close to Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael. These shelled heroes are initially cautious, but soon enough April gets them on side by showing an acceptance of their differences.

""April is a young high school student,"" stated the star.

""She's dealing with a lot, she's got a lot of feelings and a lot of things she wants to do, but she doesn't always have the confidence that she might present at first.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem comes to UK cinemas on July 31.

,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2': Vanilla Ice Calls 'Ninja Rap' the 'Perfect' Song for 'Secret of the Ooze',The 'Ice Ice Baby' rapper's '90s jam gets a loving homage in 'TMNT: Mutant Mayhem' thanks to producer Seth Rogen.,"Following the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ first trip to the big screen, the comic book heroes turned cartoon TV stars were joined by another early ‘90s fixture, Vanilla Ice, for their sequel, The Secret of the Ooze.

When the rapper spoke with ET in 1991, he shared his excitement for ""Ninja Rap,"" a now-cult favorite song he co-wrote and performed on-screen in the nightclub backdrop of the core four’s climactic fight scenes.

The ""Ice Ice Baby"" rapper, whose real name is Robert Matthew Van Winkle, was enlisted to build out a more kid-friendly cinematic outing than its gritty predecessor. As Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael and Leonardo explored the “M"" aspect of their acronym, producers leaned into laughs and dialed back the violence this time around (the film infamously didn't portray the turtles using their signature weapons, following concerns and criticism from parent advocacy groups at the time).

With that in mind, enter Vanilla Ice, who told ET that ""Ninja Rap"" and the movie's choreographed dance had gone over well with the filmmakers. ""The lyrics are great. I mean, it fits the movie perfect. Everybody loved it,"" he recalled.

Warner Bros. Pictures

When he was approached about appearing on film and onstage next to the half-shell heroes, he remembered, ""I told them I don't have any acting skills. And they said, 'Just be yourself.' I was like, 'OK.'"" (According to the credits, he technically plays himself.)

In fact, Ice claimed his star was rising so fast that producers initially pitched a larger role in the film that his schedule ultimately didn’t allow. ""Actually, they wanted me to do more of the movie than I did,"" he recalled. ""I was supposed to do some acting in the movie, but I was on tour with MC Hammer at the time and I had eight days total to do this.""

As Ice figured, ""Ninja Rap"" and his collaboration with the turtles also made sense considering their demographic crossover.

""The kids buy. The kids love it. Kids are the ones who buy my records,"" he explained. ""Kids are the ones who go see the movie. It's huge. There's no doubt about that. People over 25 don't buy records.""

When asked if he had a favorite Ninja Turtle character, Ice didn’t hesitate when he named Raphael. Why? Well…

""I like his attitude,"" he laughed.

Paramount Pictures

Over 30 years later, ""Ninja Rap"" remains an earworm for a generation who grew up in the time of the martial arts quartet’s pop culture heyday, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem producer Seth Rogen. Inside a TMNT creative brain trust, the Platonic actor, alongside his longtime co-writer, Evan Goldberg, and the movie's director, Jeff Rowe, is helping shepherd a sequel and another animated series for Paramount+.

As Rowe explained to Screen Rant, fans have Rogen to thank for the movie's loving nod to ""Ninja Rap"" and the song's inclusion on Mutant Mayhem's soundtrack.

""I wish it was my personal touch, but the use of 'Ninja Rap' is very funny and excellent,"" he told the outlet. ""That was the thing that — we just had some piece of easy listening music in there for a very long time, and we're like, 'It's kind of funny.' Then, at one in the morning one night, Seth texts me, and he's like, 'It should be 'Ninja Rap.'' And I'm like, 'Yes, that's perfect. Oh my God, that's the best idea, I wish I thought of it.' It's so good though.""

Rogen expanded on his longtime devotion to the turtles with ET, reflecting on when he was one of many kids who got caught up in the franchise’s headline-making toy craze in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s.

""I was really the target audience for the first iteration of all this stuff,"" he explained. ""My dad bought like a big box of used Ninja Turtle toys at a garage sale when I was a kid, and so I had those and I played with them so much.""

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze streams on Paramount+. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is in theaters now.

Talk to Me (15) ***

A brash summer raunch-fest in The Hangover/Bridesmaids mould, Joy Ride sees Crazy Rich Asians co-writer Adele Lim make her directorial debut with a furiously funny Asian-American road trip comedy about cultural identity, familial estrangement and the wisdom of getting a vaginal tattoo. Ashley Park stars as Audrey, a super-capable Seattle lawyer whose imminent promotion depends on closing a deal in China, a country she hasn’t returned to since being adopted as a baby by a white American family. Going along for the ride, and to help with translation, is her best friend Lolo (comic Sherry Cola), a penniless maker of sexually provocative art who’s been Audrey’s best friend since they were kids.

The film swiftly and hilariously establishes their symbiotic relationship with a playground-set prologue – and just as quickly disrupts it, first by having them forced to chaperone Lolo’s socially awkward cousin, Deadeye (Sabrina Wu), as she makes her own pilgrimage to China to visit relatives, then by amplify Lolo’s own insecurities by having them hook-up with Audrey’s hard-partying college best friend Kat, now an actress in a hit martial arts show and about to marry her hunky Christian co-star, who knows nothing of her somewhat salacious past.

Played by Everything Everywhere All At Once’s Stephanie Hsu, Kat is the owner of the aforementioned tattoo, which later becomes the source of a raucous musical set-piece and a brilliant gag involving an old Looney Tunes character. But the culture-clashing comedy is really set in motion when the businessman Audrey is in Shanghai to impress takes a dim view of her lack of awareness of her own heritage, prompting her to seek out her birth mother. High jinks involving copious drug consumption and sexual encounters with a basketball team follow, as do wry potshots at virtue-signalling misogynists, racist relatives and internalised bigotry, all of it delivered with real comic brio by a confident, up-for-anything cast whose collective ability to make you care for their characters ensures the more thoughtful turn the film takes in its final act feels earned. This is a film that lives up to its title.

That one of the funnier throwaway gags in Joy Ride involves a sexual fantasy about Splinter, the sewer-rat ninja father of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, turns out be a cheeky bit of cross-promotion from Joy Ride’s producers Seth Rogen and Evan Handler, who are also the co-producers and co-writers of the new TMNT reboot. Sadly, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is an oddly muted return for the heroes in a half-shell. After three live-action films in the 1990s and two unloved Michael Bay-produced reboots in the 2010s, the new film goes the animated route, borrowing the beautiful hand-painted aesthetics of the recent Spider-Verse films, which is striking for a little while, but the script’s efforts to re-establish the pizza-loving TMNT’s relevance falls flat with dated references to Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and shout-outs to Beyoncé, Batman and the Avengers. There’s none of the ribald humour of Rogen and Handler’s modern teen classic Superbad either, and the origins-story plot simply re-cycles the first X-Men movie.

The aftermath of a Bataclan-style terrorist attack is the subject of Paris Memories, the latest film from Proxima director Alice Winocour. Inspired by her own brother’s experiences of being caught up in the aforementioned 2015 night club attack, her film takes a sensitive, deeply humane approach to tragedy by zeroing in on Mia (Virginie Efire), the survivor of a gun attack on a cafe. Shattering life as she’s known it, the massacre – which Winocour films from Mia’s point of view as she throws herself to the floor before blacking out – becomes a fractured event in her own mind, the trauma erasing any certainty about what happened and how she survived. The bulk of the film revolves around Mia’s efforts to reconstruct the night in question, first by joining a support group for fellow survivors, then by trying to track down an undocumented kitchen worker she vaguely remembers from the shooting. Here, Winocour slyly turns the film into a detective story, one in which her protagonist isn’t so much trying to find her place in a city forever transformed by a terrible event, but her place in a city in which a terrible event has shattered some of its romantic illusions, revealing a deeper, richer, more complex reality that’s been there all along.

Entertainingly slick, if never exactly scary, the hip new Australian horror offering Talk to Me serves up a nifty riff on the ouija board party games of horror movies past by replacing this portal to the spirit world with the embalmed severed hand of a vengeful medium. Encased in porcelain, said hand is now the source of a social media-fuelled game in which suburban teens encourage their friends to hold it and utter the titutlar phrase “Talk to Me” while subjecting themselves to the merciless glare of their friends’ live-streaming smart phones as they endure an apparently terrifying brief encounter with the afterlife.

As none of these kids appear to have seen a horror film from the last 50 years, there’s no shortage of volunteers; mercifully debut directors Danny and Michael Phillippou cut quickly to the chase with some inventively rendered shocks and offset the premise’s inherent silliness by grounding their main character Mia's decision to participate in the game in the trauma of her own mother’s suicide (Mia is nicely played by Sophie Wilde). Though the resulting film owes much to the like of Flatliners and the Evil Dead, it’s a solid launch pad for the Phillippou brothers.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vYXJ0cy1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS9maWxtLWFuZC10di9maWxtLXJldmlld3Mtam95LXJpZGUtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLXBhcmlzLW1lbW9yaWVzLXRhbGstdG8tbWUtNDI0MDA3MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Mutant mayhem has descended on Manchester as a city-wide street art trail of much-loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters – Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello – has been unveiled. Hidden across the city, fans can find the turtles up to mischief, with the uniquely created hand-painted artwork that matches the new, distinct hand-drawn style of animation in the upcoming film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

A team of six street artists Woskerski, Brezaux, Captain Kris, Oust, Reves One and Sidok, part of the Blank Walls artist collective, created the mini-murals over six days around the city taking a total of 192 hours and using 448 cans of paint. Fans will see Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey doing some of their favourite activities, including performing ninja tricks, tucking into pizza and skateboarding, as part of the trail commissioned by Paramount Pictures and supported by Manchester City Centre BID.

The artwork has been unveiled ahead of the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, in cinemas on July 31. The new family action-comedy boasts a stellar cast of Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Nicolas Cantu, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Brady Noon, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph.

After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.

The characters were first introduced to the world in 1984 through a comic book, and since then have become firm favourites with kids and teenagers all over the world through TV and film adaptations. The street art trail matches the new, hand-drawn animation style featured in the upcoming film and will appeal to all the generations of fans who have grown up with the ninja turtles through the last four decades.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

In conversation with Empire, Seth Rogen stated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is “crackling with energy” and tried to avoid having “boring scenes.”

The film itself is permeated with this teenage energy – where you don’t stay in the lines, and you’re pushing harder on the stuff that you like, and you’re impressionably scribbling in the background. We started to write to the animation style. It needed to capture that – we can never have boring scenes, because the movie itself just seems to be crackling with energy.

Gen V

Seth Rogen also told Empire his Gen V is arguably “more shocking” than The Boys due to the fact its characters are still in college.

Gen V has some really crazy shit in it. The fact that they’re in college, they’re a little younger, makes it more shocking maybe. In general, if you’re making an R-rated thing, they let you do whatever the fuck you want, unless there’s some real legal thing that they think you might be bumping against. With The Boys, maybe it requires one extra five-minutes phone call, where they’re like, ‘Really?’, and you’re like, ‘Really.’ There are other things you’re on hours of phone calls about that are so much less interesting than that.

Sausage Party: Foodtopia

By the same token, Rogen also stated his upcoming Sausage Party TV series contains an “unbelievably shocking” scene that upset Kristen Wiig during recording.

There’s one specific scene that had a special screening for the Amazon PR people. You should all just start wrapping your heads around this now. You’ll probably have to talk about this a lot. [It’s] unbelievably shocking. We had Kristen Wiig in picking up a few lines the other day, and I think we’ve all become desentised to it, because we’ll just be like, ‘Roll the scene!’, and then she was like, ‘Oh my God?!

,Your Weekly Roundup of Movies: “Talk to Me” Is the Scariest Horror Film of 2023,,"TALK TO ME

**** Talk to Me is the scariest horror movie of 2023. Walking the fine line between referential and redundant—good horror filmmakers employ motifs, but bad horror filmmakers rely on them—twin-brother duo Danny and Michael Philippou stun in their directorial debut, delivering a gripping (pun intended) plot driven by starmaking performances. Sophie Wilde shines as Mia, a grieving teenage girl reeling from her mother’s passing two years earlier. Then, a paranormal party trick lifts the veil between the living and the dead—and teens recklessly abuse it for entertainment purposes (shocking!). In some ways, Talk to Me is a natural evolution beyond the Ouija board, the deadest horse of all horror tropes. In others, it’s an existential exploration that leads to a genre-defining question: Can new rules be made and/or old ones broken? Either way, there are moments when the movie makes the theater feel like a vacuum, sucking you into a vortex of heart-racing, chest-clutching, jaw-dropping terror. It’s the enthralling kind of horror that you can’t look away from. R. ALEX BARR. Bridgeport, Clackamas, Division, Eastport, Fox Tower, Hollywood, Laurelhurst, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Progress Ridge.

AFIRE

**** In the tradition of his many compromised romances (Phoenix, Transit, Undine), writer-director Christian Petzold explores connections missed, made and retroactively illuminated during a novelist’s work-cation on the Baltic Sea in Afire. In black denim and gray New Balances, Leon (Thomas Schubert) is practically in uniform as someone who hates the beach. He’s destined to miss out, but the audience doesn’t. Petzold lets us enjoy Leon’s companions—his friend Felix (Langston Uibel), their unexpected housemate Nadja (Paula Beer), and a local lifeguard (Enno Trebs)—and Germany’s north coast. All the while, Leon frets over his manuscript, and a forest fire rages in the distance. Dreamy yet frustrated, blunt yet forgiving, Afire holds space for modern life’s many scales—a creative’s navel-gazing, less selfish characters’ acceptance of provincial life, existential dread. Reveling in Nadja’s beauty, intelligence and generosity (she’s always making goulash), Petzold keeps challenging the audience with Leon’s shaky grip on protagonist status. Often, this sour lump is the last character whose vantage point you’d want in this film, but that’s all part of Petzold’s ever-fascinating “both/and” filmmaking. People will still take meaningful vacations as the world burns; a bad writer can tell a good story; and Nadja will offer Leon a welcoming smile because they’ve shared a deeply imperfect moment. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room.

OPPENHEIMER

**** At the start of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, raindrops fall; at the end, fire rages. You’ll feel it burn long after the end credits roll. Nolan has made violent movies before, but Oppenheimer is not just about physical devastation. It submerges you in the violence of a guilt-ravaged soul, leaving you feeling unsettled and unclean. With agitated charisma and vulnerability, Cillian Murphy embodies J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist whose mind birthed the atomic bomb. When we first meet him, he’s a curly-haired lad staring at a puddle, but he swiftly evolves into an excitable visionary leading a cadre of scientists into the deserts of New Mexico, where they will ultimately build and test a plutonium device (referred to as “the gadget”) on July 16, 1945. What saves the film from becoming a connect-the-dots biopic is Nolan’s ingenious chronicle of the post-World War II rivalry between Oppenheimer and Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The more Oppenheimer fights to put “the nuclear genie back in the bottle,” the more Strauss seethes and schemes, thrusting the movie into a maze of double-crosses that echo the exhilarating games of perception in Nolan’s 2001 breakout hit Memento. Of course, the thrill can’t (and shouldn’t) last. As many as 226,000 people were killed when the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they haunt the film like ghosts—especially when Oppenheimer imagines a charred corpse beneath his foot. A man dreamed; people died. All a work of art can do is evoke their absence. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, Cinemagic, Clackamas, Division, Fox Tower, Hollywood, Laurelhurst, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, St. Johns Twin, Studio One.

BARBIE

*** Once upon a time, Barbie dolls liberated all women from tyranny. The end…at least according to the first few minutes of Barbie, a sleek and satirical fantasia from director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Set in the utopian kingdom of Barbieland, the movie dramatizes the existential crises of the winkingly named Stereotypical Barbie. She’s played by Margot Robbie, who was last seen battling a rattlesnake in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon—and her misadventures in Barbie are hardly less bizarre. Plagued by flat feet, cellulite and fears of death, Barbie seeks the source of her ailments in the real world, bringing along a beamingly inadequate Ken (Ryan Gosling) with catastrophic consequences: Awed by images of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, Ken becomes a crusading men’s rights activist, leading a revolt against the government of Barbieland and instituting bros-first martial law. And they say originality is dead! With its absurdist wit, glitzy musical numbers, and earnest ruminations on whether matriarchy and patriarchy can coexist, Barbie is easily one of the most brazen movies released by a major studio. Yes, its tidy ending betrays its anarchic spirit—after insisting that empowerment can’t be neatly packaged in a doll box, the film seems to say, “No, wait! It can!”—but it would be churlish to deny the charm of Gerwig’s buoyant creation. In an age when genuine cinematic joy is rare, we’re all lucky to be passengers in Barbie’s hot-pink plastic convertible. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM

*** Part of what makes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles unique among other franchises is its malleability. Reinvention is as much a part of the Turtles’ DNA as glowing green ooze and a love of pizza—and in the case of Mutant Mayhem, the recipe is a blend of family dynamics, grandiose sci-fi and heartfelt comedy. For the first time in franchise history, the Heroes in a Half-Shell are actually voiced by teenagers: Leonardo (Nicholas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) goof around and clown on each other like any other kids, and their interactions make for the movie’s strongest moments, comedically and emotionally. Things get mighty chaotic in the back half when we’re introduced to the megalomaniacal Superfly (Ice Cube) and his cadre of mutant henchmen (voiced by several recognizable names pulled from producer-writer Seth Rogen’s contact list), but it all fits with the movie’s eager, excited vibe. There’s a love for the boundless possibilities of the TMNT world and a desire to bring as much of it to life as possible, all through the filter of a wonky, hand-drawn aesthetic that makes for some spectacular creature designs and doesn’t skimp on the martial-arts action. The quest for a perfect TMNT film remains incomplete, but Mutant Mayhem is nonetheless a fine effort: a stylish, fast-paced, eminently fun take on the material that updates the Turtles for the modern world without losing the oddball charm that has made them fixtures of pop culture since 1984. Cowabunga, dudes! PG. MORGAN SHAUNETTE. Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, Clackamas, Division, Eastport, Lake Theater, Lloyd Center, Mill Plain, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, Progress Ridge, Vancouver Plaza.

THEATER CAMP

*** In Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman’s hysterical mockumentary Theater Camp, self-delusion drives youth theater camp AdirondACTS and the lives of its eccentric campers. After the camp’s founder, Joan Rubinsky (Amy Sedaris), falls into a coma, devoted counselors Rebecca-Diane (Gordon) and Amos (Ben Platt) return to AdirondACTS to put on a biographical musical about their matriarchal founder—while crypto-bro Troy Rubinsky (Jimmy Tatro) flounders as he attempts to keep the camp afloat in his mother’s absence. Written by Gordon, Lieberman, Platt and Noah Galvin (who plays a stage manager), the screenplay delivers sharp deadpan humor as it satirizes theater kids’ notorious self-seriousness (children in a seemingly furtive drug deal negotiate for “throat coat” tea bags and Amos calls a child using a tear stick onstage “Lance Armstrong for actors”). The actors’ egos contrast with the camp’s financial ruin and the counselors’ stale individual careers; self-delusion becomes power in surviving a profession based on attention and rejection. Most scenes were improvised with rough outlines, a method that causes the story to wander, but highlights the actors’ craft and chemistry. It’s all captured with swift camera work that drenches the audience in summer camp nostalgia, a sweet blur seemingly over just as it began. PG-13. ROSE WONG. Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, Fox Tower, Living Room.

HAUNTED MANSION

** Loath as Disney would be to admit it, Haunted Mansion pulls from the same playbook as its failed 2003 attempt to turn the titular theme park ride into a blockbuster: Once again, the studio has created a horror comedy that leans heavily on spook-house kitsch and self-aware snark. So what’s different this time? A slightly better script and a postmodern approach to the story, courtesy of director Justin Simien (Dear White People). Instead of an ordinary family facing the 999 specters that haunt Gracey Manor, the film assembles a ragtag team of discount ghostbusters to stop the haunt—namely a washed-up scientist (LaKeith Stanfield), a fast-talking priest (Owen Wilson), a sassy medium (Tiffany Haddish), and an excitable historian (Danny DeVito), plus the house’s current owner (Rosario Dawson) and her adolescent son (Chase W. Dillon, the surprise MVP of the cast). The actors have fun riffing on the material, but the jokes are hit or miss and the scares are (understandably) toned down to remain kid-friendly. There’s an ongoing theme of not wallowing in grief that adds a welcome weight to the story, but it’s diluted by every character having their own mini-arc and a mystery investigation that has a few too many steps. Fans of the Magic Kingdom ride and kids with a taste for the macabre will likely find something to enjoy in Haunted Mansion, but for most everyone else it’s a passable but skippable trip to the other side. PG-13. MORGAN SHAUNETTE. Bridgeport, Cascade, Cedar Hills, City Center, Division, Lloyd Center, Mill Plain, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, Progress Ridge, Studio One, Vancouver Plaza, Wunderland Milwaukie.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3ZWVrLmNvbS9hcnRzL21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA4LzAxL3lvdXItd2Vla2x5LXJvdW5kdXAtb2YtbW92aWVzLXRhbGstdG8tbWUtaXMtdGhlLXNjYXJpZXN0LWhvcnJvci1maWxtLW9mLTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 13:16:59+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem review: youthful and fun animation,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is bursting with action, silliness, and emotion - here's our review.","Share this Article:

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is bursting with action, silliness, and emotion – here’s our review.

While their father, mutant rat Splinter (Jackie Chan) is desperate to keep them away from the cruel, violent and judgmental outside world, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will do anything to be a part of it. Attempting to win over the people of New York with acts of heroism, under the guidance of human ally April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), they decide to take on criminal mastermind Superfly (Ice Cube). Mayhem, involving mutants, ensues.

What an energizing and refreshing movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is. The film’s look, an imperfect, sketch-styled animation that takes place at night under streetlights and neon signs, is incredible. The pace, the sound, the script, the characters; everything is so full of life and movement. Released in a glut of summer blockbusters where it can be hard to work out which movies will be tired and formulaic, this is a full on blast of fresh and invigorated filmmaking.

The action sequences are visually engaging and exciting – clear, colourful and buzzing with adrenaline. It’s the antithesis of the overloaded CGI that has plagued some other recent films (leading to action sequences produced on blockbuster budgets that are little more than pixel–mulch). The scenes here are thrilling; the final battle in particular is a big, bombastic climax.

While the striking animation style is likely to grab your attention, everything in this film spins out of the youthful and excitable version of the Turtles. With Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon) and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) all played by voice actors who are actually teenagers, the Turtles have never felt like a more real and relatable group of kids. From that comes this loose animation style, excitable visual asides and fully charged action sequences.

The script comes from Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jeff Rowe, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit (with ‘story by’ credits for Rogen, Goldberg Rowe and Brendan O’Brien, and based on credits for Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird). It performs an incredible balancing act, infusing a steady stream of jokes (every character gets a chance to be funny) with a story that builds to an excellent climactic battle and deeply satisfying ending. My only real complaint about Mutant Mayhem is that it potentially has too many characters; it’s not overstuffed, but I wanted more of some of the supporting characters.

Perhaps that’s because the cast is electric. The four Turtles are allowed to lead; their characters are immediately defined, and all are really likable and funny. Ice Cube appears to relish the role of Superfly, while Paul Rudd’s Mondo Gecko is an unstoppable scene stealer. Jackie Chan’s Splinter, too, is delightful and heartening.

Mutant Mayhem's action sequences can be quite intense. That’s because of the brilliant animation, of course, but they’re all pulled tight by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ score. Any ideas that Reznor had jettisoned his Nine Inch Nails credibility to make a zany cartoon score are way off the mark. The music is dark and imposing at times, beautiful and affecting at others.

While Mutant Mayhem will draw obvious (and warranted) comparisons to the Spiderverse movies due to its look (and it’s not particularly interesting to say but the movie is visually stunning), it also shares a director (Jeff Rowe) with the excellent The Mitchells Vs The Machines. Mitchells was produced by Lord and Miller at the same time as Into The Spiderverse, and Rowe’s movie certainly bears that experience. Mutant Mayhem is co-directed by Kyler Spears. There’s such a big creative team that seem to be sharing so many credits in Mutant Mayhem; rather than attempt pick out who deserves praise for what, it feels like a better idea to just celebrate everyone.

One of my favourite things about Mutant Mayhem is how gross it can get. It gets gloopy and disgusting. In that way, the movie itself is a bit like a teenager; at once sophisticated and juvenile. In capturing an authentic youthful feeling, in being slimy and gooey and silly, and in being a story about community and family, it feels like an elevation of everything Nickelodeon were doing in the 90s.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has this formidable, intense score, wonderful and funny character writing, a striking visual style and brilliantly exciting action sequences. It’s funny and gross and cool and sweet. All of these thing just come bursting out of this film in a big ball of infectious energy.

The team behind Mutant Mayhem has created something special. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise probably needed to be reinvigorated, but I’m so bored of reading about what films mean for franchises – whether this movie or that will allow some faceless corporate money machine to continue to try to draw growth percentages from the brands that they’ve bought.

Mutant Mayhem isn’t another piece of content puked out by an algorithm, it’s this awesome, exciting, uplifting movie about these outsider kids trying to find a place in the world. It can mean whatever it means for the branding – for your afternoon in the multiplex, it means you’re probably gonna have a fantastic time with this joyous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a film about mutants that is full of humanity. It is outrageous that the modern studio system was able to produce a TMNT movie this good.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is in cinemas now.

2023-08-02 17:51:50+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: Superfly’s Revenge,"This time around, the four kung-fu-fighting old masters of the sewers dream of having a normal life with the humans. But not if Ice Cube can help it.","There’s a refreshing sense of nostalgia in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” — and it doesn’t just have to do with the fact that the eternally youthful ninja turtles have been around since the 1980s, in the form of the original comic book series, as well as TV adaptations, films, toys and video games.
It’s in the very look of the movie: meticulous computer-generated animation remixed with lively doodles and scribbles, splotches of color and unclean lines — the kind of art that would come from the combination of a free period, a pack of Sharpies and a composition notebook. After all, what’s more adolescent than that?
You probably already know the back story: Four cute little turtles get transformed by radioactive ooze and are adopted and raised underground, in the sewers of New York, by a rat named Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan) who’s a master of martial arts. They’re all big fans of pizza.
Now, as teenagers, the turtles — pugnacious Raphael (Brady Noon), doofy Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), nerdy Donatello (Micah Abbey) and their ever-earnest leader, Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) — dream of having a normal life with humans. But the aboveground masses face their own threat: Another mutated creature, Superfly (Ice Cube), aims to overtake the human world, Magneto-style. The turtles team up with a student journalist named April (Ayo Edebiri) to try to save the day and hopefully be accepted into human society.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDIvbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' Review: TMNT's Stylized Reboot is One Shell of a Blast,"If a group of animators who once doodled Cool S's with colored pencils, 
markers, and crayons as kids designed a movie, it would be this one.","Mutant Mayhem's character designers made a humorous opposite day, targeting the people who talked trash about the Bay-produced monstrosities and deliberately made the turtles adorable and their fellow anthropomorphic mutants visually appealing. Meanwhile, the humans surrounding them—excluding April—bear crude, misshaped designs, looking deformed like a Laika character, specifically from ParaNorman. That also applies to the NYC environment as each location has a hand-drawn essence learning towards angular imperfections. The more gritty it looks, the higher it elevates its ‘70s-style noir aesthetic.
Rowe showcases his action-oriented groove with the film's incredible action set pieces, on the Spider-Man: Homecoming concept of “what if a John Hughes coming-of-age flick was also an action film” but with ninjas. The boys’ first fight sequence against a bunch of thugs blends comedy and exciting combat seamlessly, and each beat of that sequence plays to their age, where they’re all equally terrified being in their first fight while kicking ass on the fly. You feel their shared adrenaline rush with the kinetic direction, and that action carries to every set piece, even down to its fantastic climax, which made my NY'er heart roar and fist pump in the air.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZHlyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXdzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Ending Explained
After pulling off the miracle of uniting the mutants and New Yorkers to bring down Super-Duperfly (Ice Cube), the mutants get to bask in some positive changes. First off, Splinter (Jackie Chan) makes good on his promises. He — and his new girlfriend, Scumbag the mutant cockroach — open up their cozy sewer abode to rehouse all of Superfly’s former posse: Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Rocksteady (John Cena), Bebop (Seth Rogen), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Ray Fillet (Post Malone) and Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd). More importantly, Dad allows Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) and Donatello (Micah Abbey) to matriculate at April’s (Ayo Edebiri) human high school.
It’s a feel-good ending made possible because the brothers and their mutant friends saved the city. With humanity accepting them as heroes instead of freaks, the brothers will finally get a taste of freedom as Splinter has a whole new set of “kids” to take care of now. Plus, he’s chilled out on his fear and trusts them to explore the world on their own terms. It’s amazing what the love of a good roach can do.

Is There a Post-Credits Scene in TMNT: Mutant Mayhem?
As noted above, there’s no post-credits scene but there is a mid-credits bit that’s worth sticking around for.
Not long into the end-credit roll, Leo’s camera phone screen pops up (in embarrassing Portrait mode!) capturing a positively giddy Donny revealing that he’s finally found his people… the Computer Club nerds in the distance clicking away on their laptops. Leo’s phone then cuts to a very proud Raph, now a member of the school wrestling team, dominating in a match. Cut to Mikey nailing his version of Leatherhead’s Aussie accent as he tells a Crocs joke doing a bit with the school’s Improv Club.
Last but not least is April talking to camera, chastising Leo to put his camera in landscape mode so he can get a wide shot of her much expanded T.C.R.I. (a.k.a. Techno Cosmic Research Institute) clue board. She reveals that the “black ops operation” essentially disappeared in the wake of Superfly’s demise, abandoning their offices without a trace. But now April and Leo are both working the case.
High on the endorphins of bonding over baddies with his crush, Leo then asks April to prom and she accepts… as friends. In fact, all four brothers get fancy and show up for the big party with their human peers. Partying without a care in the world, what they don’t see is a camera trained on each one of them. The secret feed is being watched on a monitor in a remote location… and the camera pulls out to show that it’s Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) observing them from afar.
“ It’s the unmistakable silhouette of supervillain and archnemesis of the Turtles and Splinter… The Shredder.
She says that finding the “creatures” has been much easier than she thought it would be, but capturing them is proving difficult. An off-camera co-conspirator offers, “There is one option…” and the image cuts to an exterior wide shot with the back of a figure looking out at the city from across the river. Without a doubt, it’s the unmistakable silhouette of supervillain and archnemesis of the Turtles and Splinter… The Shredder. The scene cuts to black and the credits continue.
With a movie chock full of mutants and villains like the enigmatic Utrom and the over-the-top Superfly, there clearly wasn’t a need, or room, for a bad guy the likes of The Shredder. But this surprise reveal proves that he’s on the horizon. It does a lot to appease stans of that particular villain, and sets up the Turtles, Splinter and likely their expanded mutant family for an even bigger antagonist. We’re left to ponder what exactly Utrom and T.C.R.I.’s existing relationship is with Shredder, and how they might work together to corral the mutants so she can milk… erm, bleed them of their mutant properties.
As for where we might see Shredder next, check out the details of the announced Turtles sequel movie and Paramount+ series featuring the same cast.

,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie review (2023),There are undeniably strong visuals here and enough creative voice work to make it tolerable on a hot August day when families are looking for an air-conditioned theater for a few hours.,"Yes, it’s another origin story. Despite being the seventh film to feature these characters, Rowe and co-writers Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg go back to the beginning of the TMNT saga, opening with a scientist named Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) creating the infamous ooze that turns ordinary creatures into mutants. When the authorities break into Baxter’s basement lair, the ooze is spilled into the sewers, and the rest is comic book history as a quartet of turtles becomes fast-talking humanoid creatures named Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), and Raphael (Brady Noon).
Fans of the franchise know that the turtles are nothing without their leader, Splinter (Jackie Chan), a rat who was also transformed by the ooze and became the father to the teenage mutants after teaching them the ninja skills to protect themselves. Splinter is extremely overprotective, ordering the boys to stay away from human beings at all costs or risk being milked by them (don't ask). A flashback reveals that Splinter tried to introduce himself and the turtles to the humans, but they were somewhat understandably terrified. Now they all live underground, as the turtles sneak out to get supplies and wish they could have a normal teenage life beyond the sewers.
Meanwhile, one of Baxter’s experiments responds very differently to the chasm between the human race and the mutants now living underground. Whereas Splinter wants to hide, Superfly (Ice Cube) wants something closer to vengeance.

2023-07-24 16:30:00+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Director on What Jackie Chan Adds to Splinter,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe breaks down what Jackie Chan brings to Splinter and how this take is really leaning into him as a father figure.,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has a pretty stacked cast: John Cena as Rocksteady, Ice Cube as Superfly, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote) as Bebop, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Rose Bryne as Leatherhead, Post Malone as Ray Fillet and, well, the list goes on.
But the biggest star of all? That probably has to go to Jackie Chan as Splinter, the Turtles’ mentor and father figure. And director Jeff Rowe was just as surprised as anyone that they were able to get him, he told IGN in an interview during our San Diego Comic-Con live show.
“We wanted him to do this and we had no idea,” he said. “We were like, ‘he’ll never say yes to this but let’s try it.’ But he was in. He was familiar with the franchise.”
When asked what Chan adds to Splinter, Rowe said he adds “humanity” and “a lot of warmth” to everyone’s favorite mutant rat.
“ ""Splinter’s got some crazy notions about humans, and he’s also pretty strict with the kids.
“We needed Splinter to be this loving dad character and Splinter’s got some crazy notions about humans, and he’s also pretty strict with the kids,” he went on. “And you need someone who’s just so likable and loveable that even when Splinter’s being hard, the audience doesn’t turn on him. You still like him and love him.”
And while Splinter has always acted as a paternal figure to the teenagers, Mutant Mayhem has really leaned into this. As IGN’s Brian Altano points out during the interview, the turtles even say “sorry, Dad” in one of the early trailers.
“It felt important to really make them a family and explore that style of family, where it’s single dad, four kids,” Rowe said. “He’s trying his best and it’s really hard because he did not expect to become a father.”

,"Ice Cube's Mutant Mayhem Improv Accidentally Ran Up The Bill For Legal Clearances, According To Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Director","Ice Cube expressed a terrific, deep knowledge of hip hop in his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem recording sessions.","Assembling a cast of smart, clever, and funny performers to play a diverse collection of weirdos in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, director Jeff Rowe gave his actors a lot of freedom in the recording studio – even going as far as to simply record natural conversation between the four stars voicing the titular heroes. When it came to Ice Cube’s performance as Superfly, however, there was a bit of a snag. Apparently, the former N.W.A. member would express such a deep knowledge of hip hop that it threatened to raise the film’s bill for legal clearances.
Ice Cube’s time in the booth making Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem came up in conversation earlier this month when I had the chance to interview Jeff Rowe at San Diego Comic-Con 2023. Given that there is a scene in the new animated movie where Superfly has the line “Six in the mornin’, police at my door” (a line from Ice T’s “6 In The Mornin’), I asked about the movie’s meta sensibilities, and Rowe explained how O'Shea Jackson Sr.’s special expertise played into his recording sessions:
That was just Ice Cube. We'd be like, 'Can you try improving something here?' And then he would say a song lyric and we'd be like, 'That's great! You're running up the bill on the film for legal clearances.’ But has such a deep knowledge of hip hop and its history, and just like had so many things that he was able to recall so quickly. It was a delight to watch.
In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Ice Cube’s Superfly is the central antagonist and established as a criminal scourge plaguing New York City. As the Turtles are maturing and figuring out how mutants can co-exist with humanity, Superfly has a different perspective, as he has ambitions to wipe out the human race and create a world dominated by mutantkind. And evidently, the villain is very into hip hop.
Similar to the humor of Ice Cube quoting an Ice T lyric, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem also has another fun meta moment involving Jackie Chan… though Jeff Rowe also says that it’s more coincidence than anything. In the film, the action movie legend voices the paternal mutant rat Splinter, who trains the Turtles in martial arts – and the way he goes about it is by showing them footage from action movies, including the work of Jackie Chan. Smiling, Rowe told me,
Those are like accidental. I mean, we weren't... like before we cast Jackie Chan, we were like, 'We should make the fight sequences choreograph like Jackie Chan fights,' and then we cast Jackie Chan and we're like, 'This is perfect!'

,I worked on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from thousands of miles away,Artist Sean Sevestre has played a key role in the creation of the film despite being based in Edinburgh.,"I worked on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from thousands of miles away
By Angie Brown BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter

Sean Sevestre has played a key role in the creation of the new blockbuster film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - despite being thousands of miles away from his Hollywood colleagues.
The 29-year-old Scottish artist has worked on the visual development of the hit new movie for two years from his Edinburgh home.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which stars Seth Rogan, Jackie Chan and John Cena, was released earlier this month.
Sean worked as a concept artist on the movie. He would draw the ideas, then a 3D animator would makes a graphic model from his designs.
""So far this is the most impact I've had in a film,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""Hollywood is high paced and exciting and the people I worked with on this film reflected that.
""I felt extremely respected and trusted. There was always room for me to try stuff and to make mistakes and to work on things.
""When I watched the film I thought it looked amazing - there is nothing that has ever looked like this before.""
Paramount
Mutant Mayhem was released earlier this month
Sean spent a decade teaching himself how to draw and make films.
""I started a product design degree at university when I was 17 but after four weeks I quit because it became clear it wasn't going to teach me what I wanted to do,"" he explained.
""I then enrolled at art college on a painting degree but again I left after two weeks.
""I felt so strongly about it that I decided to teach myself. My mum gave me two years to see if I could make it work.""
From his bedroom in Penicuik, Midlothian, he began to teach himself techniques using the internet.
""My mum was fairly sceptical but she trusted me because I'm not an irrational person.
""I had a burning fire inside me. I was so serious about it that I taught myself relentlessly every day.
""I studied the anatomy of the body and how it moves and how light works.""
Paramount
Sean said there had been a lot to learn.
""I disappeared for three years and looking back it's a bit of a blur.
""I was obsessed in a good way. I pushed myself as hard as I could and gave up a lot of social stuff.""
When he was 20, Sean he felt he had reached a good base level and started posting some of his work on sites where Hollywood producers look for new talent.
It was then he was asked to work on the movie A Monster Calls, which starred Liam Neeson.
""I was so excited because it felt like a breakthrough
""All of a sudden my mum could see things were working for me.""
Sean said he learned from his entrepreneurial dad to have the confidence to teach himself.

Sean taught himself to do competitive tricking
He said: ""My parents divorced when I was five and I would see my dad in the holidays. We would go snowboarding and I would say: 'I can't snowboard.' He would say: 'I taught myself so can you'.""
Sean learned classical guitar and taught myself to do competitive tricking, a form of acrobatics involving flips and twists.
""I got good at tricking and this gave me the confidence to know that I could teach myself anything I put my mind to.""
He was then commissioned to work on pop superstar Lil Nas X's Starwalkin' video and directed his own feature-length documentary, Perfect Storm.
Now he has built a studio in his Portobello home in Edinburgh.
""Now I actually have to turn down work that comes in which is an incredible place to be,"" he said.
""Growing up in a small town in Scotland I never thought I'd end up working in Hollywood.
""But thanks to the internet I was able to make a name for myself in the industry even though I felt far away from that world.""
Sean Sevestre

Sean got a B in Higher art at Beeslack High School in Midlothian.
He added: ""I wasn't the art guy, nobody expected this.
""I've not got this crazy talent. What I do is a result of extreme deliberate practice that has taken me from being average to someone now with a reputation.
""Anyone who wants it badly enough can do it. It's dedicated time and practice and hard work continually sitting at the edge of your ability that gets you there.""
So what's next for Sean?
""I'm working on something exciting just now, but I can't talk about it.
""I'm still pushing myself and looking to achieve more.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1zY290bGFuZC1lZGluYnVyZ2gtZWFzdC1maWZlLTY2NTMzMDM20gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLXNjb3RsYW5kLWVkaW5idXJnaC1lYXN0LWZpZmUtNjY1MzMwMzYuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-28 10:00:00-04:00,Seth Rogen did Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Marvel scares him,"Seth Rogen, producer behind The Boys, Invincible, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, plans to stay far away from the Marvel and DC universes.","What does this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie have in common with 2011’s oddball superhero flick The Green Hornet? A name: Seth Rogen.
And while that might not seem like a feather in Mutant Mayhem’s cap, all the other Seth Rogen-produced comic book adaptations between the two do: There’s Preacher, The Boys, and Invincible, with more seasons and spinoffs of the latter two on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem looks to follow that streak.
The four wisecracking, pizza-scarfing turtles have featured in cartoon shows, movies, and toys for so long that it’s easy for their comic book origins to be eclipsed. In 1983, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird assembled their lightly parodic comics series from bits of every blockbuster superhero comic of the time: the teenagers of New Mutants and New Teen Titans; the mutants of the X-Men; and above all, Frank Miller’s Daredevil, from which they borrowed ninjas and martial arts, an origin story involving weird chemicals, a mentor named after a piece of wood, and a faceless horde of bad guys named after a bodily extremity.
Their self-published comic was the kind of sales and licensing success that rocked an industry still stretching its muscles from decades of publishing consolidation. So it’s not merely that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are an evergreen brand — they’re also a shoo-in for Rogen, who has quietly made a second career of racking up hugely successful comic book adaptations not based on Warner Bros. or Disney properties.
Polygon sat down to chat with Rogen in anticipation of the film, which he co-wrote and executive-produced (and for which he recorded the voice of Bebop), and which features the work of director Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells vs. the Machines) and a cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Giancarlo Esposito. Paramount has already announced development on a sequel and a Paramount Plus TV spinoff, making Mutant Mayhem the dawn of a new era of the ever-mutating franchise.
[Ed. note: This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike against the AMPTP went into effect.]
Polygon: My favorite way to talk about TMNT’s arc from comics to a transmedia franchise is to point out that it started with making puns about Daredevil. What do you think it is about this really unique comic about altered reptile karate kids that keeps capturing different generations’ hearts and minds?
Seth Rogen: Someone smart once said all the best ideas start as jokes. And I think that this firmly falls into that category. It started as a way for two comic book writers to make each other laugh, literally. They were they were doodling in their sketchbooks, trying to crack each other up, and that’s where the first images of this came from.
But, like great writers, they imbued it with something that is undeniably relatable and resonant, which is the teenage part. That word is what makes it go from being a silly thing that is disposable, to something that weirdly has resonated with people for 40 years. It’s because they’re teenagers, and they feel this desire to be a part of the normal world, and this desire to be understood, and that they’re fun and kind of reckless and immature. That is really the thing that has made them resonate for so long. To me, it’s the thing that I thought was also the most underexplored. But it started, literally, as a comic book, and then became a Saturday morning cartoon and became toys — a lot of toys.
And I loved the toys. The toys themselves honestly had so much creativity put into them, and so many weird details and artistic elements. Something me and Jeff [Rowe] always talk about is how the Mondo Gecko toy — his tail had a roller skate tied to it, suggesting that [laughs] it was too heavy for him to drag around and so he, like, thought to put a roller skate on it to roll it around behind him. Little things like that were so imaginative, and they really have stuck in my head for 35 years.
And then the movies! I skateboarded because of the Ninja Turtles, and I did karate — it really tapped into a lot of things that were really popular in the ’80s, and ’90s as well. I felt like I was constantly the recipient of their goals; everything they were trying to do was really landing on me.
You’re quietly one of the biggest producers of indie comics adaptations in Hollywood. Preacher, The Boys, Invincible, and going back to The Green Hornet. How do you define your taste in comics? What kind of comic is the comic that grips you so hard that you go, Yeah, I think I want to make this my job for a year?
Well, first of all, it’s everything that is not Marvel and DC. [laughs] So that eliminates a lot right away. I grew up going to comic book shops, and it’s funny, video stores are making a slight comeback in some ways. This idea of browsing and not having things fed to you — as I think people feel we are now when it comes to entertainment — but instead entering the fair market of entertainment and just wandering around and seeing what catches your eye.
That’s what I always did with comic books; I would go to the comic book shop and I would just walk around. And you see this comic book and it catches your eye, and you see that comic book and it catches your eye. Those have been the things that have really inspired us and made us want to work on these things for a long time — coupled with the inclination that you have something to add to it. There are a lot of comic books I love and things I love, but I’m like, What would I add?
Like, I love Akira — what am I going to add to Akira? Things like that, where it’s out, and it’s good, it’s a movie and it exists. That’s something we think of also. For [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem], honestly [co-writer Evan Goldberg and I] felt like there was an unexplored facet, and as people who have written a lot of teenage films and have been cinematically linked to that genre a lot over the years, we were like, Oh, like, that’s totally different for this, is if we do a teenage version of it. A lot of it is just thinking, Could we bring this to life well and do it in a way that, as fans of it, we wouldn’t be annoyed with ourselves if we were watching it from the outside?
What has turned you off from Marvel and DC?
Honestly, probably fear. [laughs] We really have a pretty specific way we work; me and Evan have been writers for 20 years at this point. It’s a fear of the process, honestly. And I say that knowing nothing about the process. There are a lot of Marvel things I love.
It’s mostly a fear of how would we plug into the system they have in place, which seems like a very good system, and a system that serves them very well. But is it a system that we would ultimately get really frustrated with? And what’s nice about [Mutant Mayhem] is that we’re the producers of this. So we dictated the system, and we dictated the process in a lot of ways. And that’s what’s also appealing for us about The Boys and the other bigger franchise-y type things we’ve done, is that we are creating the infrastructure and process for them, not plugging into someone else’s infrastructure and process. We’re control freaks!
Working on those bigger-budget, bigger-scope projects can be a real beast, and so can animated films. Are there specific lessons that you took from them for Mutant Mayhem?
I approach them very similarly. That’s something that I realized I used to think was a bug, and now I think it’s a feature. [laughs] A lot of people who make animated movies really approach them like animated movies, and they are constantly, from a writing standpoint, thinking of how to use the medium of animation, in the cutting pattern, in the scene patterns and all that. I’m firmly from the live-action world and so I very much write in the style of a live-action movie.
To me, I’m trying to bring what I would consider a traditional cinematic sensibility to the structure and the flow and how the scenes are, and not play too much into the medium in that way. And then to give the whole thing a look that is just, like, insane, was really a fun way to shade the whole thing.
It was unexpected to me, and I was honestly a little worried at what a big swing the look was at first. But the more I saw of it, I just started to get more and more excited about, and then started writing towards it, and thinking, OK, we have this crazy look. What do I want to see executed in this look? [laughs] What would be fun to watch?
Do you have comics on your bucket list for adaptation? Or, alternatively, what comics are you reading these days that you can’t put down?
That’s a good question. What have I been reading? I read old comics, from time to time. There’s these Green Lantern comics I’ve been reading, I love all those Grant Morrison Superman ones, I was rereading those because I heard that that’s what the James Gunn Superman movie was gonna be inspired by. I read them when they first came out, but I feel like I was distracted, so I went back.
Are there any that I wish we could make or adapt? Every once in a while? Yeah, those Grant Morrison ones are really appealing. We3 is something I’m a big fan of. It seems maybe just too sad honestly; it just bummed me out.
[Ed. note: We3 is a comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely about a trio of weaponized cyborg-animal hybrids. It’s infamous for its extreme violence and extreme pathos.]
We’ve kind of been down that road — and we know Grant a little bit, we’ve talked to him. That’s what’s nice, is we’ve done well with things that were traditionally considered unmakeable, essentially, for a long time. But also we don’t want to ruin things we love. So we’ll have very honest conversations with Grant and just talk about it and where his head’s at, and where our heads are at. Things like We3, we’ve talked to him about several times over the years. And we’re kind of always like, Yeah, I just don’t think this is the thing right now. There’s things like that — we really talk to the creators to make sure that we all think it’s a good idea, at that moment, in that way.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzODA4NjMxL3NldGgtcm9nZW4tdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy10aGUtYm95cy1pbnZpbmNpYmxlLWludGVydmlld9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzgwODYzMS9zZXRoLXJvZ2VuLXRlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtdGhlLWJveXMtaW52aW5jaWJsZS1pbnRlcnZpZXc?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 13:00:00+00:00,TMNT director teases that Shredder will appear in future movies,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem co-director Jeff Rowe says he'd be ""100%"" down to make a sequel in new SFX interview","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character Shredder might not be in Mutant Mayhem but he'll definitely show up in future movies, says co-director Jeff Rowe. If the new animation spawns a franchise, that is...
""We'll Dark Knight it,"" Rowe jokes to SFX magazine in the new issue, which features Good Omens season 2 on the cover, before adding that he'd ""100%"" love to develop a sequel. ""When you've grown and you've become confident as a teenager, to then go up against a foe that is three times scarier than anything you've ever seen before, that's interesting and dramatic.""
In TMNT lore, Shredder is the archenemy of the titular Turtles' mentor Splinter, who is voiced in the new film by Jackie Chan. Various iterations of the character, who is most often known as Oroku Saki, have have been depicted over time, including human and non-human, as well as both male and female.
As you might expect, Mutant Mayhem centers on righteous reptilians Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, as they set out to win the hearts of their fellow New Yorkers, after years of being sheltered from the human world. Alongside their new friend, April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the anthropomorphic foursome attempt to take down a mysterious crime syndicate, but find themselves in over their shells when they become the target of an army of mutants.
Seth Rogen, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, John Cena, and Paul Rudd are among the star-studded voice cast. It releases on August 4.

Referencing how the Turtles are very rarely adolescents whenever a new version of the 1980s cartoon rolls around, Rowe, who helmed the movie with Kyler Spears, told SFX: ""We wanted a teenager to watch the movie and feel seen by it and understood.
""That was our cornerstone for everything, like making the Turtles not hulking, ripped versions of themselves, but lanky and awkward. That carried through into casting actual teenagers. It's insane that it had never been done before."" Here, the eponymous quartet are voiced by Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr.

2023-08-03 15:46:19.733000+00:00,Mutant Mayhem is a grody and gorgeous reintroduction to the TMNT,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem knocks it out of the park with a straightforward story elevated by phenomenally inspired art direction and sharp action.,"There has seldom been a moment during the past 20 years when there wasn’t a relatively new spin on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles airing on TV, playing in movie theaters, or appearing in comic books, which is part of what made director Jeff Rowe’s Mutant Mayhem animated feature such a curious surprise when it was first announced. With there being so many different modern takes on the characters first created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, it wasn’t all that clear what more that could be done with them that 4Kids, Warner Bros., Nickelodeon, and parent company Paramount hadn’t already tried multiple times over.
Narratively, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is such a classic and straightforward Turtle tale that it’ll ring almost too familiar to anyone who knows the heroes in a half shell — especially those who’ve kept up with the franchise over the past couple of years. But between the movie’s delightfully grimy art direction, its hyper-kinetic action sequences, and its quintet of strong, pointedly youthful lead performances, Mutant Mayhem is also hands down one of the most exciting and definitive outings the Ninja Turtles have ever had.
Set largely in the slime-filled sewers of New York City, Mutant Mayhem tells the slightly updated story of how Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) grew up to become pizza-munching, anthropomorphic, reptilian crime fighters after being exposed to mutagenic ooze as ordinary baby turtles.

After years of living in secret and being raised by their similarly mutated adoptive rat-turned-father figure, Splinter (Jackie Chan), the boys all know just how dangerous the surface and the humans who call it home can be for people who aren’t considered “normal.” But as teenage boys who’ve spent their entire lives being forced to hide in the shadows and made to practice their ninjutsu arts strictly for self-defense, the brothers can’t help but be curious about the bright, bustling world above that’s always been just out of their reach.
Almost all of the early beats in Mutant Mayhem’s script from Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit feel like the movie checking off a list of TMNT basics for newcomers. But it breezes through them with a swift and stylish precision that telegraphs Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears’ razor-sharp sense for crafting the bigger, busier action sequences that come later on and brilliantly showcases Arthur Fong and Tiffany Lam Almack’s absolutely stunning art direction.
While the Ninja Turtles have been varying degrees of cute, “cool,” and alarming, throughout their almost 40-year-long history, there’s always been an innate ick factor to them that’s a big part of their appeal. Mutant Mayhem’s Turtles are still a gaggle of sewer-dwelling teenage boys who don’t clean behind their ears because they’re not entirely sure if they have them. But one of Mutant Mayhem’s most brilliant moves is the way it parlays the TMNT brand’s classic grossness into a more expansive grotesque aesthetic that defines the entire world around the Turtles, but — interestingly — not the Turtles themselves.
Unlike the Turtles, who — despite being unique in small ways — all share a recognizable symmetrical wholeness, basically every single human who appears in Mutant Mayhem is rendered as a kind of artfully bizarre nightmare person whose faces all feel like reflections of the city (and humanity’s) ugliness. It’s as true of the innocent strangers the Turtles sneak by during their bodega runs as it is of ​​Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) — the villainous head of the research lab desperately trying to replicate the process that led to the mutagenic ooze’s creation. But it’s not at all the case with high school student April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), whose chance encounter with the Turtles one evening gives them all hope that they might finally have a shot at making some real new friends.

Occasionally, Mutant Mayhem might feel a bit too packed with pop culture and brand references for its own good — particularly to older theatergoers who lived through previous corporate marketing blitzes designed to turn people into lifelong Turtles fans. But everything about Mutant Mayhem’s quippy sense of humor, its scribbly / sketchy visual language, and its focus on the Turtles’ obsession with the surface is meant to remind you that — in addition to being mutant ninjas — they’re a bunch of goofy kids that actual children are meant to be able to relate to in an organic way.
It’s exactly the sort of vibe that a reboot meant to kick off a new era of films and spinoff series should have, and while it remains to be seen whether Paramount can really keep this momentum going long term, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the studio’s absolutely knocked it out of the park.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzgxNzI5Ni90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Published Aug 02, 2023
In April 1984, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's black-and-white comic book Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit the newsstands, introducing the world to New York City's favourite heroes in a half-shell. Leonardo, the group's de facto leader, heads the charge as he announces his and his brothers, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael, presence to the Purple Dragons, emphatically proclaiming, ""We're not wearing costumes.""In the nearly 40 years since, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have gone from comic book superheroes to action figures to TV and movie stars and around the world, kids have marked their allegiance with their favourite Turtle (for the record, mine is Michelangelo, for obvious reasons). For generations of children, TMNT dominated recess, Halloween and playtime from Canada to England to Japan, igniting our imaginations as we went into battle with Splinter, April and Casey.In recent years, the Turtles were given the live-action treatment — but in T eenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (in theatres now), our boys are back in animated form. Directed by Jeff Rowe and co-written by Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg , Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, Mutant Mayhem takes us back to the beginning with an all-star cast and killer soundtrack.But before we dive into the sewers for some pizza, here are five facts about the film that you might not know. Cowabunga, dude!Normally in animated films, the voice cast are brought to a sound booth separately to record their individual parts, with crafty editors stitching everything together in post-production. However, in 2019's The Lion King, Seth Rogen, who voiced Pumbaa, was able to actually record alongside Donald Glover and Billy Eichner, the film's Simba and Timon, respectively.Rogen's experience was so positive that he wanted to ensure that the voice actors in Mutant Mayhem were given the same opportunity, telling The Hollywood Reporter , ""We really went out of our way and bent over backwards on Ninja Turtles to try to capture that improvisational energy that you get when a lot of people are in the same place at the same time.""And the proof is in the pudding. Not only is the chemistry between the four Turtles — Nicolas Cantu (Leonardo), Micah Abbey (Donatello), Brady Noon (Raphael) and Shamon Brown Jr. (Michelangelo) — free-flowing and natural, seasoned comedians like Jackie Chan, Hannibal Buress, Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph, and of course, Rogen himself, are clearly relishing in the shared space.Given the name of the group, oddly, the past TMNT works have rarely explored the boys' teenage side. Rowe and Rogen — the latter of whom has a rich and successful resume creating teen comedies — wanted to position Mutant Mayhem as a high school movie, detailing the natural angst involved in growing up as outcasts in society with an over-protective parent.In developing the coming-of-age nature of Mutant Mayhem, Rowe was influenced by the classic films of the genre as well as more modern examples like The Edge of Seventeen and PEN15. ""We wanted it to be like Stand by Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" Rowe told Empire . Naturally, Rogen's Freaks and Geeks and Superbad, also stood in as sources of inspiration, particularly in the humour of Mutant Mayhem.As the first animated TMNT film since 2007, Rowe (who co-directed The Mitchells vs. The Machines ) had his work cut out for him, especially considering audience standards for animation are currently at an all-time high. To create the gorgeous and vivid animation in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen turned to the animation studios of Mikros and Cinesite.Mikros Animation, the animation house behind the PAW Patrol films, utilized hundreds of animators and VFX artists in their Montreal and Paris offices to create the incredible comic book-style artwork, that includes sketches that resemble high school notebook doodling. Cinesite's Vancouver team, a visual effects powerhouse that has worked on Game of Thrones and World War Z, were also tapped to develop the dynamic imagery of Mutant Mayhem that not only brings to life TMNT's comic book roots, but the '90s aesthetic as well.In addition to the electrifying score by Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross , Mutant Mayhem boasts an awesome soundtrack. ""It's a lot of songs that me and Jeff Rowe, the director, ourselves listen to,"" Rogen told ET Canada To reflect the New York City setting and '90s timeframe, Rogen and Rowe curated songs with a heavy '90s East Coast hip-hop and R&B influence, including Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"" and Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya."" The seemingly random assortment of songs on the soundtrack reflect the frenetic nature of a teenager-made mixtape, with the energy and spirit of youth found throughout.Just as important as the Turtles is their father, Splinter. Voiced by Jackie Chan in Mutant Mayhem, Rowe and Rogen really leaned into the character's dad vibe, as well as the DIY nature of putting together a look living in a sewer.""Jeff Bridges's the Dude character from The Big Lebowski was a big fashion inspiration,"" Mutant Mayhem's lead character designer Woodrow White explained to Den of Geek . ""Splinter's build was [also] partially inspired by Danny DeVito, with his short stature and long arms.""Chan's contributions to the film even go beyond voicing Splinter. Studying Chan's fighting style in films like Police Story and Rumble in the Bronx, Rowe brought the splashy editing and comedic rhythm of those legendary fight sequences into Mutant Mayhem, resulting in some high-energy, action-packed moments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZXhjbGFpbS5jYS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNsYWltLmNhL2FtcGFydGljbGUvZml2ZV9pbnRlcmVzdGluZ19mYWN0c195b3VfbWlnaHRfbm90X2tub3dfYWJvdXRfdGVlbmFnZV9tdXRhbnRfbmluamFfdHVydGxlc19tdXRhbnRfbWF5aGVt?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The Mutant Mayhem is about to begin
The arrival of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is imminent. The new version of the popular franchise arrives to theaters around the United States on August 2, 2023, and if critics are to be believed it might just sweep all of the awards away from the other big summer releases. Seth Rogen’s film is set to become one of the biggest premieres in an already packed movie season.
The movie is getting non-stop praise from critics all over the country, even going as far as calling the new movie “the best of the franchise.” With huge names such as Jackie Chan, John Cena, and more behind the many voices of the animated film, this reboot of the Turtles Universe is set to become the flagship version of the turtles for an entirely new generation.
There’s even talks about a sequel already being greenlit, and with the magnitude of the Turtle’s popularity there’s no doubt that we’ll be having plenty of discussions about who the best Turtle is.

The film enjoyed generous preview screenings ahead of its opening Wednesday and has earned an eye-popping $247.5 million already.
Meg 2: The Trench, the giant shark action sequel co-produced by Warner Bros. and China’s CMC Pictures, slipped to third place in its second weekend with $16.7 for the frame and $91 million overall. Chinese fantasy blockbuster Creation of the Gods 1: Kingdom of Storms climbed back into second place, taking in $26.8 million for a hefty $283.4 million four-weekend total, according to data from Artisan Gateway.
Paramount Pictures’ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, meanwhile, bombed with a three-day start of just under $1 million — despite the presence of Chinese action icon Jackie Chan in the starring voice cast. The flop continues a trend of Hollywood titles struggling to break through at China’s box office. Local ticketing service Maoyan projects Ninja Turtles to top out in China with just $1.5 million.
No More Bets is executive produced by Chinese hitmaker Ning Hao (Crazy Alien) and directed by relative newcomer Shen Ao. The film follows a computer programmer (Lay Zhang) and a model (Gina Jin) who are enticed abroad by the promise of high-paying jobs but find themselves duped by a ruthless gang and forced to participate in online fraud. Ao has said that he researched hundreds of cases of a real-life cyber fraud cases involving Chinese citizens as part of his writing process. Maoyan forecasts that No More Bets will finish its run with over $500 million, which will make it China’s biggest hit of the summer.

Paramount and Nickelodeon’s animated adventure is getting a jump on the weekend by debuting on Wednesday. This weekend’s other new release, the Warner Bros. shark sequel “Meg 2: The Trench,” lands in theaters on Friday.
“Mutant Mayhem” is projected to pick up $35 million to $45 million over its first five days of release. Meanwhile, “Meg 2” is targeting a three-day start of $25 million to $30 million. Those films will vie for second place on box office charts alongside Christopher Nolan’s historical drama “Oppenheimer,” now in its third weekend of release.
Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” which is expected to top the box office for the third straight weekend, added a leading $12.8 million on Wednesday. The fantasy comedy, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the stereotypical versions of Barbie and Ken, has generated $394 million in North America, making it the second-highest grossing movie of the year. It’s the third-biggest 2023 release at the global box office with $811 million.
The PG “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” adaptation cost $70 million, which is more economical than other summer blockbusters.

2023-08-01 16:09:01+00:00,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Beg BTS’ Jung Kook Not to Watch Them Sing ‘Butter’ in ‘Mutant Mayhem’ Teaser,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sing BTS' 'Butter' in a teaser for the upcoming 'Mutant Mayhem' animated movie reboot.,"It’s right there in the name: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So, given that said bony-shelled reptiles are right in the demo, it’s fitting that in a new promo for the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that is out on Wednesday (Aug. 2), Leo, Raph, Don and Mikey are unabashed members of the ARMY.
“This is it, guys,” Raphael laments in the 20-second clip in which the foursome are lashed to a giant bomb-like device that seems to spell their demise. “Oh, so many regrets,” he groans. “I just wish I could see BTS IRL,” says Donatello.
Leonardo, of course, has a creative idea, offering, “We could do some of the songs for you,” he says, with Michelangelo adding that he’d be down for a few bars. Leo then gets the gang started, singing the first lines of BTS’ global No. 1 smash “Butter,” while encouraging the others to join in. But, given their predicament — they are lashed to a wall by their wrists and ankles — the song comes out as more of a cry than a croon.
It’s all a bit sad, honestly and Don complains that they don’t even really know the words. To be fair, the tweet of the clip had a very stark warning message: “Jung Kook please don’t watch this.”
In addition to the four turtles (voiced by Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon), the film also features the voices of Rogen, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Paul Rudd and Maya Rudolph; Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote and co-produced the film directed by Jeff Rowe.

2023-08-18 16:10:27+00:00,Box Office Mayhem: Starless Publicity Campaigns Start to Impact Grosses,"Movies could see grosses slashed by 15 percent as talent sits on the sidelines. ""Nada. Zero,"" laments one Hollywood studio marketing executive.","The scene on the Paramount lot on a warm Saturday afternoon late in July was unusual — to say the least — as the studio threw what was essentially a premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem without the film’s star-studded voice cast. Instead, director Jeff Rowe had to man the green carpet on his own at what was billed as a special family screening.
Across Hollywood, marketers are having to scrap media tours amid the dual Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes, with guilds forbidding their members from promoting any movie from a struck company.
Now, the box office is feeling the impact as films open without the full participation of stars and writers. Several studio sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that a movie’s earnings at the box office could be hurt by as much as 15 percent because of the dramatic falloff in talent-driven publicity.
Turtles’ voice cast alone includes Ayo Edebiri, Maya Rudolph, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd and Post Malone.
The new TMNT faced a double whammy, since Rogen is also one of the film’s writers and has been unable to bank any press since the writers strike commenced more than 100 days ago. “It was bizarre,” says one source close to the movie of the July 29 screening. “Can you imagine what the group photo [of stars] would have been like on the carpet?”
Turtles, which debuted Aug. 2, a Wednesday, posted a respectable five-day domestic opening of $43.1 million. In terms of sheer dollars, insiders believe the movie will take a hit of $7 million to $10 million because of the publicity restrictions.
Universal’s R-rated comedy Strays, about a pack of raunchy dogs, and DC’s Blue Beetle both open during the Aug. 18-20 weekend and will be observed closely to see how they perform. Strays’ high-wattage voice cast includes Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Will Forte, Isla Fisher, Randall Park, Josh Gad and Sofía Vergara.
A top marketing executive at another studio notes that no amount of paid advertising can make up for the kind of awareness a star can ignite if a personal social media post, interview or other promotional bit, goes viral. “Not having stars to do publicity for your movies is a huge detriment to the overall campaign,” says the exec. “You lose the cultural impact of having talent talk about the film. Some movies wouldn’t have worked anyway, but they had more of a shot.”
There are dozens of films set to open between now and the end of the year. Some studios have already made changes to their release calendars because of the publicity deficit, such as Sony, which delayed the early August release of Gran Turismo, whose cast includes Orlando Bloom and David Harbour, in order to build buzz by first holding sneaks over two weekends.
On the awards front, MGM pushed back the September release of Luca Guadagnino’s awards hopeful Challengers, starring Zendaya, to 2024 (the sports drama had been slotted to open the Venice Film Festival, but pulled out).
Zendaya — who has a huge reach on social media — also stars in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming event pic Dune: Part 2, which, as of now, is set to open Nov. 3 in North America timed to its global rollout. But that could easily change, since Legendary is said to be insistent on a full press tour by the cast, which also includes Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler.
Legendary and studio partner Warner Bros. will need to make a decision soon regarding Dune 2, since the marketing and publicity campaign needs to ramp up in earnest by early September.
Like Zendaya had been, Chalamet is on double duty this year. In addition to Dune 2, he plays the lead in Warner Bros.’ Christmas tentpole Wonka. Insiders say Warners and other studios are loath to push back movies wholesale considering theatrical is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, which leveled the box office. At the same time, there is no denying the risk of staying the course if the strikes aren’t resolved. (Barbie and Oppenheimer, which have been a boon for moviegoing, were all but done with their publicity campaigns before SAG-AFTRA went on strike.)
“The inability of stars to actively participate in the promotion of their films has definitely set the industry on edge,” says box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore. “While the box office impact is difficult to quantify with mathematical certainty, there is no question that this time-honored tradition has value.”

“The bigger swing these animated movies are taking, the more excited people seem to be like that,” says Rogen in a new featurette.
In the story, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.
“They had to feel like real teenagers,” says writer/director Jeff Rowe of the pizza-loving Turtles, which extended to creating a visual style as if it were animated by teens.
“What we wanted to do was create an incredibly fun and engaging version of the Ninja Turtles,” says Rogen, a producer, writer and the voice of Bebop.
Ice Cube, who voices Superfly adds that “the animation and flavor of the movie was so original and fresh.”

Director Jeff Rowe told Insider that he learned several Gen Z phrases while making the film.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" director Jeff Rowe said that he learned lots of new phrases from the movie's Gen Z cast members.
Rowe and producer Seth Rogen cast teen actors, whose ages range between 15 and 19, to voice the titular turtles, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.
The cast — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr, Brady Noon, and Nicolas Cantu — recorded their lines together in the same booth in order to allow them to riff off each other.
In an interview with Insider, Rowe said that some of the conversations between the turtles in the movie were improvised by the actors.
""There's this very funny scene where the turtles are just talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. Like, 'Hey, we're gonna be like real New Yorkers. Get a bacon egg, and cheese sandwich.' And they're all like quoting different YouTube videos that they watch and they just go off for like a minute talking about that,"" Rowe said.

""We didn't script that. They just did that in between takes. I think they were just legitimately talking about bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. And then they were like, 'Make sure you're rolling,'"" the director continued.

Rowe added: ""And then we just put that in the film. It's totally improvised and totally not planned. It's unwritable. I don't think you can write that.""
Rowe said that he and the producers had to check if the teens' conversations were appropriate for the PG-13 movie, especially when they used Gen Z slang.
""I learned what 'rizz' is,"" Rowe said. ""They would say stuff and then we'd be like, 'Cool. Just say it like that. Wait, is that offensive? Is that beyond PG-13? What? Okay. No? It's cool.'""
Rizz is short for charisma and is used in romantic situations when a person is able to effortlessly charm another person.

,"Could cartoon films like ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" cure the superhero slump?","We could use some mixing up around the superhero world these days. Some wise-cracking, pizza-eating turtles might be the best bet we’ve got.","James Owen
Columbia Daily Tribune
In 2023, we’ve seen a number of comic-book movies — the dominant genre of the past 15 years — underperform at the box office. Sure, they still make hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide but this type of movie typically makes billions at the box office. Huge numbers required to justify budgets in the $250 to $300 million range.
But the recent spate of superhero flicks, namely “The Flash” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” has suffered from the weight of its own expectations. The stories are grim and connected to an increasingly complicated web of other films and streaming series. Only hardcore fans can keep pace.
The visual effects, crafted by artists working under the strains of COVID delays and excessive demand, look cheap and dingy despite the hefty investments. In short, the live-action comic-book film has become a chore and no one but the die-hards really want to watch.
Some have called it the superhero slump. Some have said it should be a cultural watershed.
An exception came out earlier in the summer. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” was produced for just $100 million but grossed almost seven times this amount. The film is vibrant, colorful, engaging, and very hip.
It is also fully animated, using a number of styles and palettes to not only further the plot but bring contrast and depth to its characters. Watching “Across the Spider-Verse” made me wonder why more comic-book productions from DC or Marvel just don’t go the full cartoon route. This seems like it could be the cure panicked studio executives are seeking.
I’m burying the lede here because the new iteration of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” subtitled “Mutant Mayhem,"" should not work nearly as well as it does. It too goes down the path of animation for a film that jumps off the screen and presents a visual treat — in addition to providing excitement and humor as we head into the final stretch of summer.
We’ve had versions of the Kevin Eastman comic in the past. In 1990, there were guys in suits fashioned by the Jim Henson Studio. I remember that being pretty fun, but I was 12 years old, so of course I would like just about anything. In 2014, we got a CGI-heavy re-creation that looked too dull to endure.
Now, Seth Rogen and writing-producing partner Evan Goldberg have put their creative muscle into a version that’s dark and grungy but never forgets its real purpose: to be eye-grabbing and amusing.
Even though the film takes place in the sewers and alleys of New York City, the look is clear and the action is well-defined. The film experiments with a number of looks and styles. There’s even some live-action segments sprinkled in. None of it intended to show off, but to keep the action fresh.
Since Rogen and Goldberg co-wrote the script — they also gave us “Superbad” and “This is The End,” among other raunchy romps — there are some pretty good laughs. You either find it funny or you don't; it’s a subjective thing. I chuckled fairly regularly.
Sure, they go pretty low as they are wont to do. Even for a PG film, there’s a preoccupation with bodily functions and bathroom activities. That I did not laugh at so much.
But it’s not just the writing. There’s good voice work by people you would recognize from a Rogen film. Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, Maya Rudolph. It sounds virtually like a Judd Apatow film! But even more unusual voices like John Cena and Jackie Chan also show up. The personalities shine through the visuals.
The music is also eclectic. In addition to a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, you get A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul and Blackstreet pounding on the soundtrack. Not exactly your typical animated movie, but one you might expect from white dudes raised during the ’90s.
But that’s my point — it’s refreshingly atypical. I haven’t mentioned the plot. Which is a shame because it doesn’t slouch. While the story promises a showdown between mutants, it doesn’t quite work out that way. Best for you to discover.
The real joy of “Mutant Mayhem” is its approach. The film may be a bit too dark and violent for little kids but anyone in grade school will probably endure it. As an adult, I can tell you it works even if it goes over the target audience’s head.
If there is a path forward for comic-book flicks, you can see it with “Mutant Mayhem” and “Across the Spider-Verse.” If you’re going to pay an actor big bucks to fly around in front of a green screen, won’t you get more bang for your buck by going all out on the animation? Heck, it might be cheaper and better.
We could use some mixing up around the superhero world these days. Some wise-cracking, pizza-eating turtles might be the best bet we’ve got.

2023-07-20 14:00:00+00:00,How Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem Puts a Fresh Spin on the Franchise,"Actual teenagers and a fresh, wild art style mark a new era for the classic franchise in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.","This appreciation dripped into the team’s approach to Mutant Mayhem. Seth Rogen says the filmmakers strove to keep what was drafted in the concept art. “I’ve been through this process so many times where you see the concept art and by the time you’re making the movie, it has lost all of its energy. That did not happen here,” he reveals. “It was asymmetrical and imperfect. I remember the first time seeing it dimensionalized, and it blew my mind.”
The Turtles in the Room
The story and style of Mutant Mayhem boast teenage vigor, but to hear adults voicing the core team would betray all that the filmmakers envisioned. So it was critical that, for the first time ever, the Ninja Turtles are played by actual teenagers. “Part of the spirit we were trying to capture was to make the movie fun, like kids playing with toys,” says Rogen, revealing that even his adult co-stars had fun playing off each other IRL. “That was something we talked about. How do we make it feel fun and silly? This reckless weirdness that almost every kid playing with their toys has?”
Actors Nicolas Cantu (The Walking Dead: World Beyond), Brady Noon (Good Boys), Shamon Brown Jr. (The Chi), and Micah Abbey (Grey’s Anatomy) voice Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, respectively. In an unusual turn for any major animation project, Mutant Mayhem recorded the cast in-person, together, allowing them to improvise lines. The goal was to capture the authenticity of teens hanging out—something that no adult screenwriter can replicate in Final Draft.
Casting was “arduous,” according to Rogen. Citing his own experiences in voiceover work, Rogen strove to mitigate factors that can sometimes leave animation projects feeling inauthentic. “A recurring frustration I have is that you never perform with the other actors,” he says. “The magic of our work that people like is a result of being in the moment and playing off each other. That energy was important to capture. So we went through painstaking lengths to make sure that as much as possible, they all recorded together.”
Fittingly, this approach to recording enabled the filmmakers to see their adolescent stars slowly become their characters—and vice versa. “They’re very much [acting like] themselves,” Rowe says. “So much of the dialogue is just things they said to each other.
I cannot think of another animated film at this scale that’s worked that way, in casting kids and letting them be their authentic selves. We wanted these characters to be complex and feel like people you knew.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vbW92aWVzL3RlZW5hZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1uZXctc3Bpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Speaking with Empire, Rogen touched on what fans can expect out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which releases in August 2023. “The film itself is permeated with this teenage energy – where you don’t stay in the lines, and you’re pushing harder on the stuff that you like, and you’re impressionably scribbling in the background,” Rogen said. “We started to write to the animation style. It needed to capture that – we can never have boring scenes, because the movie itself just seems to be crackling with energy.”

Rogen, who co-wrote the screenplay for the movie alongside Evan Goldberg, director Jeff Rowe, Dan Hernandez, and Genji Samit, added, “Part of the reason I did karate was because of the Ninja Turtles. Me and Evan both did karate together. My dad got me nunchucks that I cracked my head open with, because I was obsessed with the Ninja Turtles, and Michelangelo specifically.”
TMNT: The Heroes in a Half-Shell Enter a New Era With Mutant Mayhem
Originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984, the four heroes in a half-shell made their theatrical debut in 1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Two sequels followed, 1991’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze and 1993’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, before 2007 brought about an animated remake, TMNT. In 2014, the turtles returned to live-action with the Michael Bay-produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which was followed by a 2016 sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.
The official synopsis for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem reads, “After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a notorious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.”

,Vanilla Ice '90s hit 'Ninja Rap' is in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie with Seth Rogen,"After ”Ice Ice Baby,” '90s rapper Vanilla Ice had a hit that would also stand the test of time: ”Ninja Rap” for ”Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” in 1991","“Go, ninja, go, ninja, go!”
More than 30 years after his song made its debut, Vanilla Ice is having a moment. The world knows the ’90s rapper for his megahit ”Ice Ice Baby” — but another rap of his is generating some new engagement, thanks to the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" reboot by Seth Rogen.
""Ninja Rap"" was performed in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze"" live-action film in 1991 by Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Rob Van Winkle of Wellington, Florida. It's the sequel to the original ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie that was released a year earlier.
""TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,"" executive-produced and co-written by Rogen, was trending this week. Here are things to know about Vanilla Ice and his ties to Florida and the ”Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.”
How popular is 'Ninja Rap' by Vanilla Ice?
Like Vanilla Ice on his social media platforms, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" fans are using the #goninjagoninjago hashtag. Some Instagram Reels are set to ”Ninja Rap.” The hashtag's been used on Twitter and TikTok. A check on Spotify two days before the Seth Rogen movie's release — Aug. 2 nationwide — show ""Ninja Rap"" has had more than 7.3 million streams, Vanilla Ice's fourth most popular Spotify. (For those wondering, Vanilla Ice's mega hit ""Ice Ice Baby"" took the Top 3 spots on his music profile in the music streaming service with a collective 371.4 million streams.)
Is Vanilla Ice in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie?
The '90s rapper had a cameo in the 1991 film ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze"" ... as a rapper performing on stage. Rogen said in news reports that he included Van Winkle‘s ”Ninja Rap” in the 2023 reboot's soundtrack along with other rap songs from East Coast artists.
After ”Ice Ice Baby,” this is another Vanilla Ice rap hit that would stand the test of time. To this day, the rapper continues to use ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" references, #goninjagoninjago and #NinjaRap on his platforms.
What is 'The Vanilla Ice Project?'
After his rap career, Vanilla Ice/Rob Van Winkle became a reality TV star on HGTV (home and gardening channel) and DIY Channel (do-it-yourself). For almost 10 years, he hosted ”The Vanilla Ice Project,” with several Florida homes remodeled or renovated.
In 2015, the reality TV star helped build a therapeutic pool for then 6-year-old Owen Johnson of Palm Bay, who was paralyzed in a car accident with his family at 2 years old, according to a USA TODAY story.
For two seasons, the home renovation star hosted ""Vanilla Ice Goes Amish” in 2013.
Outside of HGTV, the rapper competed on season 23 of ABC’s reality competition ”Dancing With the Stars” in 2016. His dance partner was Witney Carson. During his season, he famously formed a bromance with fellow dancetestant former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Spoiler alert: Vanilla Ice did not win the mirror ball trophy and was the 10th celebrity eliminated. Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez won that season.
Where does Vanilla Ice live in Florida?
In addition to his long rap career (he's touring with other '90s bands) and HGTV shows, Van Winkle is also known as a passionate Wellington resident, who is seen in and around Palm Beach County eating, stopping, collaborating and listening (get it? Lyrics from ""Ice Ice Baby"") . He lives in Wellington.
In August 2022, Van Winkle helped open a ""brewery slash museum"" in one of Lake Worth Beach's most historic buildings, according to a story in the Palm Beach Post. He helped restore a 100-year-old Masonic building about a block from City Hall into a four-level entertainment venue with a rooftop bar.
What is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles about?
""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is a popular franchise about four teenage turtles named after legendary artists from the Renaissance, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo — and their Sensei-slash-father Splinter the rat. Splinter raised the turtles from shell to teendom and taught them martial arts while living in the sewer. They befriend a TV reporter, April O'Neil, and nemeses in the series or movies often include Shredder, mutants Rock Steady and Bebop, and occasionally friend-foe Casey Jones, a hockey mask-wearing vigilante with martial arts skills of his own.
Over the years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" has been a cartoon series, an animated series, a trilogy of live-action films in the '90s, and a Michael Bay reboot in 2014 and 2016 starring Meghan Fox.
The 2023 reboot stars martial arts star Jackie Chan as Splinter, Shamon Brown Jr., Micah Abbey, Brady Noon and Nicolas Cantu. Rogen, Chan's co-star in the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies, and several other celebrities (John Cena, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Paul Rudd) have voice cameos in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.""

2023-08-03 03:16:49.588000+00:00,Ninja Turtles seem truly like teenagers in ‘Mutant Mayhem’,"More than ever, franchise’s new adventure gives itself over to the mindset of adolescence.","There are some good gags and clever innovations in the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” but there is one brilliant idea: casting Ice Cube as the voice of the movie’s mutant insect supervillain Super Fly.
It might have once been hard to foresee the value of having the MC who rapped of “dropping bombs on your moms” as the MVP of a PG-rated kids movie. But we’re now up to the seventh “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film, not counting all the series and videogames. That’s a lot of movies for a bit of IP that’s clung more firmly to lunch boxes than it has to pop culture. For the turtles, it was getting to be time to either, as Ice Cube would say, “chickity-check yo’ self” or try something new.
“Mutant Mayhem” can’t entirely get over the feeling of trodding over well-covered turtle ground. But if we must go once more into the ooze, the film by director Jeff Rowe (co-director of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”) and co-written by co-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is probably the best of a not-so-stellar franchise. It’s certainly the one most invested with that “teenage” part of the turtles’ name. Plus, it’s got Ice Cube as a fly who quotes from the O’Jays.
‘‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’
Untitled Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Jeff Rowe and written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit. Running time: 99 minutes. Rated PG (for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material). Now showing at local theaters.
The animation is vividly textured, the beat is persistently hip-hop (Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and others pack the electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and the New York of the film is impressively detailed. But the most important twist to this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” iteration may be diving into the teenage-ness of its 15-year-old turtles.
If “Barbie” was balanced between Greta Gerwig’s childhood memories and her adult feminism, “Mutant Mayhem” gives itself over more fully to the mindset of adolescence. That’s in the gross-out humor and the comic book-like feel of the animation. But these are also recognizable teenagers who watch movies (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”), pine for concert tickets and make goofy phone videos of themselves slicing watermelons.
What Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) and Raphael (Brady Noon) really want is to fit in and go to high school like other teens. They have been relegated to the sewer ever since Splinter, a rat voiced by Jackie Chan, happened upon them after they were exposed as hatchlings to the same ooze that spawned Super Fly — who himself was the product of experiments by scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito, fated to dubious laboratories).
Splinter has much the same opinion of the majority of the rats in “Ratatouille”: Humans can’t be trusted. (Splinter’s particular fear is that they will “milk” him.) So the turtles have grown up undergroundwhile yearning for the wider world.
They find a hint of it with a high-school journalist named April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), who wants to document, and thus prove to humankind, their decency. At the same, the turtles meet the charismatic Super Fly and his band of mutants. At first, they’re fast-friends — “cousins,” Super Fly says — but the turtles then start hearing of Super Fly’s plans to turn all animals into mutants and eradicate the world of humans.
“Peoples, they got to go,” chimes one mutant.
Some of the thunder of “Mutant Mayhem” has been stolen by “Into the Spider-Verse” and this year’s “Across the Spider-Verse” — films that likewise upend the typical look of studio animation and do it with a pulsing soundtrack; but they did it more eclectically.
Yet this “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” while a half shell of those films, has its own low-key charms. It’s goofier, grosser and mostly fun. The four turtles are never more than a hard-to-differentiate bale of overlapping dialogue of doubt and anxiety. But that first word in their name finally feels genuine. Seven films in, it’s only right that Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael should get a renaissance.

Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Rowe explained that Rogen immediately came up with the idea that the turtles would have seen all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. “Seth was like, ‘Oh, I’m sure they’ve seen Avengers,'” the director said. “And for them, it’s like, ‘The Hulk saves the world [in Avengers: Endgame], so no one’s scared of him, and he can take selfies with people in a diner.’ And then when it came time to record the kids debating this decision, we were like, ‘We should just have them use the exact argument that we’re using in our story discussions. Let’s have the kids say that.'”
The Heroes in a Half Shell get animated
Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., and Nicolas Canto lead the voice cast of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem as the titular Heroes in a Half Shell — Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Leonardo, respectively. Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Ice Cube, Maya Rudolph, and Paul Rudd, among others, also lend their voices to the film.
“After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,” reads the official film synopsis. “Their new friend April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.”

2023-08-08 13:09:31+00:00,"'Mutant Mayhem 2' Villain Confirmed, Other Iconic Characters May Also Appear - Inside the Magic",Expect some very familiar faces in 'Mutant Mayhem 2'.,"Which iconic villains will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is currently entertaining audiences of all ages in movie theaters and has opened to glowing reviews and impressive box office figures ($51.6 million worldwide to date, against a $70 million budget).
The film has an impressive assortment of heroes and villains, but it’s the latter that boasts the most where A-list actors are concerned. There’s Seth Rogen (Bebop), John Cena (Rocksteady), Rose Byrne (Leatherhead), Ice Cube (Superfly), Paul Rudd (Mondo Gecko), and Giancarlo Esposito (Baxter Stockman), to name a few. But with the exception of Bebop and Rocksteady, Mutant Mayhem is missing some major iconic villains.

In an interview with Den of Geek at San Diego Comic-Con, Mutant Mayhem director Jeff Rowe talked about where things might go in the next movie, which, looking at the critical reception for the current film and, more importantly, the box office takings, is inevitable.
“I think a lot of people are gonna want more,” Rowe said. “These characters are so wonderful, this casting is so wonderful, you just love spending time with them. The Turtles’ world is a big one. There’s a lot left to explore. Conversations are happening, and it would be really exciting to let these characters keep on living and breathing.”
One of those conversations is undoubtedly centered around the Turtles’ iconic arch nemesis.

Warning: there are major spoilers ahead for Mutant Mayhem!
During a mid-credits scene, the Ninja Turtles, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), are adjusting to life at Eastman High with their new friend April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri).
However, it’s revealed that TCRI head Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph), who earlier in the film failed to extract the Ninja Turtles’ mutagen-blood to create an army of mutant soldiers, has surveillance on our half-shell heroes. Before the scene ends, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder, who we see standing in the dark near Brooklyn Bridge.
Related: “New Turtles” Teaser Finally Reveals Two Characters Now Portrayed by Female Actors
In a recent interview with SFX magazine, when discussing whether or not The Shredder will show up in Mutant Mayhem 2, Rowe jokingly said, “We’ll Dark Knight it [the sequel],” referring, of course, to the film, The Dark Knight (2008), the second film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, which introduces the Caped Crusader’s arch nemesis, Joker (Heath Ledger), who was missing from the first film in the series, Batman Begins (2005).
Fans hungry for another slice of Ninja Turtles won’t need to wait long, though. Paramount has already greenlit a 2D animated series for Paramount+ later this year, titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2023), that will follow on from Mutant Mayhem, as part of a planned TMNT shared universe.

The mid-credits scene confirms that The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2. He may even show up in the 2D animated series, but it’s likely Nickelodeon will want to save the silver samurai for the silver screen.
While The Shredder is a somewhat exhausted villain, we’ve no doubt that the “Mutant Mayhem-verse” will offer a fresh take on the character, just as the first film has done with its roster of mutants. But which other iconic villains from the wider TMNT universe do we need to see in the sequel?
The Shredder
Many fans would argue that you can’t have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (or show) without The Shredder, the franchise’s most iconic villain. But Oroku Saki was actually killed off in the first volume of the original Mirage Studios comic books in the ’80s.
Be that as it may, the 1987 cartoon series immortalized the character, as he went on to appear in numerous iterations on the small screen, in comic books, video games, and four out of seven of the theatrical movies (not counting Mutant Mayhem‘s mid-credits scene).
Now that we know The Shredder will appear in Mutant Mayhem 2, it’s high time for something very different. While the Michael Bay-produced 2014 live-action film gave us a “Transformer” version of the character, we’re hoping for something a bit more subtle.
Related: All 12 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Explained (Yes, 12!)
The Foot
You can’t have The Shredder without the Foot (known also as the Foot Clan or the Foot Soldiers). His legion of ninja followers are often depicted as wearing black bodysuits to blend in with the dark, and with large, bug-like eyes on their masks (a bit like Spider-Man).
The Foot are hardly the front and center of TMNT‘s extensive rogues gallery, but they’re just as iconic as The Shredder, largely because they’re so heavily associated with him. Assuming Mutant Mayhem‘s version of The Shredder is a ninja, then the Foot are a no-brainer.
In the mid-credits scene, we only see the side of The Shredder’s helmet, and the spikes on his shoulder pad. He certainly looks like a ninja, but whether or not he’s Oroku Saki remains to be seen. But as Splinter (Jackie Chan) isn’t the Hamato Yoshi version, who shares a history with Saki, it’s unlikely.

Krang
For many fans, Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) remains a bit of a mystery. This is understandable, because Mutant Mayhem doesn’t reveal much about her, other than the fact she heads up TCRI, and wants the Turtles’ blood to create super-soldiers.
In the mid-credits scene, she decides to enlist the help of The Shredder to help her capture the Turtles now that they’re in high school and surrounded by people, as opposed to living in the shadows. But who is Cynthia Utrom?
Well, we know the word “Utrom” is the name given to Krang’s species — yes, the Krang, from the many cartoons and comic books and live-action movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) — and we know that they love to make mutant armies.
Cynthia Utrom’s human form is probably a robot, with a Krang operating from the inside, who is most likely female, especially when you consider that the mutants Leatherhead (Rose Byrne) and Wingnut (Natasha Demetriou) are female versions of past iterations.

Baxter Stockman
While Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito) already appears in Mutant Mayhem’s opening sequence, there’s plenty of room for him to appear in the sequel. The tricky part is that Stockman is (apparently) killed before the opening credits, but he could always show up in a flashback sequence, or some kind video diary footage.
The sequel may even reveal that Superfly (Ice Cube) is the same person as Baxter Stockman. In previous iterations of TMNT, Baxter is Superfly, as part of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like mutation storyline, however, in Mutant Mayhem, both characters are entirely separate. As far as we’re told anyway, as Superfly’s hair looks suspiciously similar to Baxter’s.

Casey Jones
We know what you’re thinking: Casey Jones isn’t a villain. But Mutant Mayhem doesn’t appear to be following the TMNT playbook all that much. For starters, most of its mutant characters were born as animals, such as Superfly, Bebop, and Rocksteady, whereas in previous iterations they are humans who are transformed into mutant animals.
And don’t get us started on all the lore the film completely ignores, from Splinter’s backstory with The Shredder, which seems to have been thrown out of the window, to the fact that the Ninja Turtles end up in high school. A bold and admirable direction, for sure, but loyal to the TMNT mythology this film ain’t. This could work in its favors, though.
Casey Jones, the hockey stick-wielding vigilante, could be introduced a villain, which would create an interesting dynamic between Casey and April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), and in turn, the Ninja Turtles.

2023-08-05 15:28:37+00:00,"Movie review: ‘Mutant Mayhem’ a fresh, authentic take on the ninja turtles","The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.","Radioactive ooze generated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and “Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse” has helped birth “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” the new animated feature about everyone’s favorite rambunctious, pizza-loving reptiles. Directors Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears showcase the turtles in a way we’ve never seen them before, utilizing a blend of 3D and 2D animation to create a unique, rough-hewn (on purpose) style that suggests children’s book illustrations blended with teenage sketchbooks.
That edgy look is paired with a script that’s funny and fresh, a soundtrack filled with classic New York hip-hop, and a stunning industrial score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
It’s clear that Rowe, Spears and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (who also produced the film), Dan Hernandez, Benji Samit and Brendan O’Brien, have a deep love and nostalgia for these lovable ‘80s relics, who were ubiquitous in the childhoods of older millennials. These sewer-dwelling rapscallions, raised and trained by a rat named Splinter, were born on the pages of a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. There were toys, a memorable Saturday morning cartoon, and three live-action movies back in the 1990s (who could forget the refrain sung by Vanilla Ice: “go ninja, go ninja, go!”). But the less said about the film adaptations in the 2010s, the better.
‘Mutant Mayhem’ is both a new direction for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a return to the past, symbolically, locating the material in the land of teenage imagination, memory, nostalgia and emotion. The animation style doesn’t quite nod to comic books, but rather looks like a messy drawing that a fan might scribble in a notebook, with lopsided heads and visible drawing lines, as if done by crayon or pastel.
The color palette is dark with pops of neon, giving it an early ‘90s look. Sprinkled throughout are video clips that nod to the cultural touchstones of the creators: snippets of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” a salute to John Hughes, to whose vision of American high school the teen turtles cling, and instructional karate training videos, which is how Splinter (Jackie Chan) teaches his young turtle sons to defend themselves against the terrifying outside world.
The creators get back to basics with the story, focusing on the question of fathers and sons, mutants existing within humanity and the universal desire for acceptance. Splinter, a New York City street rat, is already inured to human rejection when he adopts the four adorable turtles covered in radioactive ooze. He raises them in a loving environment, away from the hustle and bustle (and malice) of the city, and Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), grow up in a tight-knit quartet, though they long to be part of the world.
On the other hand is supervillain Superfly (Ice Cube), a mutant who doesn’t hide from humanity, but harbors genocidal impulses toward the people who have deemed his and his mutant brethren unacceptable. He wants to make every creature on earth a mutant, tipping the balance of power away from the humans and toward the mutants, believing it the only way they’ll find their place in the world.
With the help of intrepid reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), the turtles decide to stop Superfly in the hopes that if they’re seen as heroes, they’ll be celebrated and integrated into society in order to fulfill their dream of going to high school (they’re teenagers, they’ve got teenage dreams).
The themes are broad and universal but the writing is remarkable — the dialogue feels natural and authentic to the age group, and it’s filled with modern slang and references to pop culture, rap songs, anime, comedy and more. Their desire for community is a resonant message, but it’s expressed in layered dialogue that feels like the way real teens talk to each other, and it’s beautifully performed by the four actors voicing the turtles.
The filmmakers manage to balance the contemporary feel of the writing and innovative visual style with their own nostalgia for childhood cultural touchstones, which makes “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” a fascinating and highly entertaining blend of old and new.

2023-07-31 14:00:15+00:00,August 2023 box office preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ kicks off last month of summer,"August is often referred to as the ""Dog Days of Summer,"" because at a certain point, the box office just dies.","August is often referred to as the “Dog Days of Summer,” and it’s not just because of the intense heat that is permeating the country, but also because at a certain point, the box office just dies, as people go on vacation and others prepare to return to school in September.
This is a particularly onerous August, not just due to the ongoing strikes that will guarantee no late night talk show appearances … or shows, for that matter. But also, since July got super-primed by the whole “Barbenheimer” craziness, as well as how well “Sound of Freedom” has done (after barely getting a mention in my July preview), the pressure is on more than ever.
Still, the best bets for the month will be the franchise films, with a number of comic book movies and a sequel to a surprise hit. Read on for Gold Derby’s August 2023 box office preview.
SEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” (Paramount – Aug. 2)
The popular Turtles, who have managed to thrill kids going all the way back to the 1990 movie that kicked off the whole franchise, return, this time in animated form in a movie produced and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and directed by Jeff Rowe (“The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). With a group of teen actors voicing the Turtles, the movie is very much relying on the popularity of the characters – or “the IP” as Paramount prez Brian Robbins might put it – among kids of all ages. It also has a voice cast that includes Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Ayo Edebiri (who is everywhere this month), Paul Rudd, Maya Rudolph and more, all voicing well-known characters from the Turtles mythos. I’ll have more to say about this in Wednesday’s weekend preview, noting that the movie opens Tuesday night.
“Blue Beetle” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 18)
A lesser-known DC character whose movie was once going to stream directly to HBO Max (now just “Max”) is actually getting a theatrical release in what might normally be a rough part of the month. Xolo Maridueña plays young Jaime Reyes, who acquires the mystical space scarab that turns him into the superhero Blue Beetle in this movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, co-starring Susan Sarandon. It might seem odd to introduce a DC character in their first feature this way, but DC and Warners must realize there is an absolutely ginormous LatinX community that regularly goes to movies, who will be thrilled to have their own superhero. Being released later in August may actually be a boon, allowing it to get away from the “Turtles” and possibly open with somewhere between $25 and 30 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” (Warner Bros. – Aug. 4)
Jason Statham returns, and so does the giant prehistoric shark he faced in 2018’s “The Meg,” this time with British indie genre filmmaker, Ben Wheatley, behind the camera. As with that first movie, which grossed $145 million domestically after a $45 million opening, this one is very much relying on the bankability of Statham and the popularity of giant monster movies, as well as sharks, in this case being more than one. It’s opening earlier in the month – shortly after “Shark Week” on Discovery, which one should remember is merged with Warner Bros now. Early August can still produce a number of hits, but this sequel is opening against “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which will have more of a built-in audience. Check back in the weekend preview on Wednesday to learn more about how this might do.
“Gran Turismo” (Sony – Aug. 25)
Loosely based on the Playstation racing game and directed by Neil Blomkamp (“District 9”), this is a very different take on a video game movie, based on the real-life story of GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough, who went from gamer to real-life race car driver. Mardenborough is played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, with the cast also including David Harbour from “Stranger Things,” Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. This probably won’t have too much trouble against “Last Voyage of the Demeter” (below), because it does have the namebrand from the video game and looks to have some decent action directed by Blomkamp. At the last minute, this was delayed two weeks, into a terrible weekend towards the end of the month, and honestly, it might have trouble getting to the $20 million mark now.
“Strays” (Universal – Aug. 18)
A movie delayed from its original June release is this R-rated comedy involving the likes of Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, Randall Park and Isla Fisher voicing lovable mutts trying to find their way to homes, with Ferrell voicing a dog looking for revenge after being abandoned by his owner (played by Will Forte). A rare adult-targeted hybrid of live action and animation, “Strays” is directed by Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”), and it should benefit from a number of very well-received trailers, which could make this a surprise summer comedy hit ala Seth MacFarlane’s “Ted” (2012) or (ironically) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “Sausage Factory” from 2016. Expect this one to open with $20 million or more if early reactions give it a boost against “Blue Beetle.”
“The Last Voyage of the Demeter” (Universal – Aug. 11)
Universal already tried to capitalize on its Dracula IP earlier this year with “Renfield,” starring Nicolas Cage as Dracula, but this is more of a straight horror film directed by respected horror filmmaker André Øvredal (“Trollhunter,” “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). The cast includes Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton”), Aisling Franciosi and Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”), David Dasmalchian (“Oppenheimer”), Woody Norman (“C’Mon C’Mon”) and creature performer Javier Botet (“The Conjuring 2”) as Dracula/Nosferatu. It’s definitely the type of movie that Dracula enthusiasts should appreciate, but remembering how badly the horror-comedy “Renfield” bombed, making just $17.1 million domestically, gives me pause. Still, being the summer, this could end up with an opening in the teens or maybe slightly better, and “Gran Turismo” being delayed two weeks will help.
“Retribution” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 25)
Liam Neeson plays a banker whose life is thrown askew when he finds a bomb in his car holding his two kids in this new revenge thriller from director Nimrod Antal (“Predators”), remaking the Spanish film “El Desconocido.” Neeson’s latest revenge thriller is one of a number of films essentially being dumped into the not-so-ideal weekend before Labor Day, where movies go to die. It’s odd that it’s going up against a new film from Open Road, Neeson’s nascent home for the past few years; neither movie will be helped by that fact.
“The Hill” (Open Road – Aug. 25)
Dennis Quaid stars in this sports drama about the real-life Rickey Hill, as played by Colin Ford, who overcame his physical disability to play professional baseball. Jeff Celentano directs with Joelle Carter and Scott Glenn co-starring, and this is the type of inspirational film that could find an audience after the success of Sound of Freedom. Still, Open Road is on its last legs, and this is being dumped in a bad time of the summer.
“Dreamin’ Wild” (Roadside Attractions – Aug. 4)
Director Bill Pohlad (“Love and Mercy”) helms this musical biopic about ‘70s duo Donnie and Joe Emerson, as played by Casey Affleck and Walton Goggins, whose family raised the funds to produce their record by leveraging their farm. The movie also stars Zooey Deschanel, Chris Messina, Beau Bridges and Noah Jupe (“A Quiet Place’) and Jack Dylan-Grazer (“Shazam!”) as younger versions of Donnie and Joe. Just because I haven’t heard of the Emersons, doesn’t mean they don’t have fans, but will they even know this movie exists?
“Shortcomings” (Sony Pictures Classics – Aug. 4)
Randall Park (who appears in “Strays”) also makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Adrian Tomine’s serialized comic story from “Optic Nerve,” starring Justin H. Min (“Beef”) as a indie filmmaker in the Bay Area whose girlfriend (Ally Maki) and best friend (Sherry Cola from the recent “Joy Ride”) move to New York City, leaving him trying to find himself. This premiered at Sundance but got lost in the shuffle. Although I enjoyed it, I’m not sure it’s wise to give it a wide release.
“Golda” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 25)
Also getting a wide or moderate release is this biopic about Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir, as played by the one and only Oscar-winning Dame Helen Mirren. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Guy Nattiv (“Skin”), this would normally be in the Oscar race in any other year. Instead, it’s being dumped into late August with a trailer just released. I smell a bomb.

Time to get into some limited releases …
“Passages” (Mubi – Aug. 4)
The latest indie drama from Ira Sachs (“Love is Strange”) stars Franz Rogowski and Ben Whishaw as a gay couple whose marriage is threatened when one gets into an affair with Adèle Exarchopoulos. Mubi has decided to release this unrated after the MPA gave it an NC-17 rating after being well-received at Sundance.
“Jules” (Bleecker Street – Aug. 11)
Sir Ben Kingsley teams with “Puzzle” director Marc Turtletaub in this comedy in which he plays Milton Robinson, a man living in a small western Pennsylvania town, whose life changes when a UFO and its alien passenger land in his backyard.
“Between Two Worlds” (Cohen Media Group – Aug. 11)
Juliet Binoche stars in this film directed by Emmanuel Carrère based on French journalist Florence Aubenas’ nonfiction-bestseller about her own experiences exploring the state of uncertainty in French society.
“Birth/Rebirth” (Shudder – Aug. 18)
Another popular horror film from this year’s Sundance is Laura Moss’ twist on Frankenstein with the underrated Marin Ireland playing a morgue technician trying to reanimate her little girl using materials from a pregnant woman (Judy Reyes).
“The Adults” (Variance – Aug. 18)
Michael Cera, Sophia Lillis (“Stranger Things,” “Enola Holmes”) and Hannah Gross star in the latest indie dramedy from Dustin Guy Defa (“Person to Person”), playing siblings dealing with the death of their mother. It premiered at Berlin earlier this year, then played Tribeca Festival.
“Bottoms” (United Artists – Aug. 25)
At one point, this new R-rated comedy from Eliza Hittman (“Shiva Baby”), starring Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Rachel Sennott, was supposed to get a wide release, having played well at its SXSW premiere, but now it’s relegated to select cities. Edebiri and Sennott play queer high school chums who start a fight club in hopes of having sex before they graduate.
“The Inventor” (Blue Fox Entertainment – Aug. 25)
This stop-motion animated film written and directed by Jim Capobianco follows the life of Leonardo da Vinci with a voice cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Daisy Ridley, Stephen Fry and Matt Berry. (This is also getting a moderate release in a very busy late August weekend.)
“Scrapper” (Kino Lorber – Aug. 25)
Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) plays the absent father of a child (Lola Campbell) who decides to live on her own after her mother dies in this feature directorial debut from Charlotte Regan.
That’s it for this month. September will be all about the festivals and the official start of Oscar season as the box office tends to slow down even more.

,"Movies to watch in August, from 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' to 'Blue Beetle'","A video game adaptation, a pair of raunchy comedies, and more","To those who finally returned to theaters for the first time in forever thanks to ""Barbenheimer,"" welcome back! Movies are pretty cool, huh? Unfortunately, the summer movie season has likely peaked with the dual release of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" But there are still plenty of intriguing new releases in August, from a reboot of a beloved '80s property to a pair of raunchy comedies that could make for your next great double feature.
""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" (Aug. 2)
Cowabunga! The ninja turtles are back for their first animated movie in more than 15 years, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" following two live-action Michael Bay films. ""After years of being sheltered from the human world,"" the turtles set out to ""win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts,"" per Paramount. Seth Rogen worked on the screenplay and voices Bebop, and the rest of the voice cast includes John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The turtles also have a new look, as the film's art style is reminiscent of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" With great turtle power comes great turtle responsibility.
""Meg 2: The Trench"" (Aug. 4)
What better way to close out the summer than with a big, dumb shark movie? Jason Statham returns in this sequel to ""The Meg,"" the 2018 surprise hit that saw him gloriously face off against a megalodon shark. This time, he and Wu Jing ""lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean,"" which ""spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival,"" per Warner Bros. It's based on the follow-up to the original novel, and the screenwriters from the first movie are back, though there's a new director: Ben Wheatley, the filmmaker known for disturbing horror movies like ""Kill List."" Hopefully, the sequel hasn't bitten off more than it can chew.
""Shortcomings"" (Aug. 4)
Randall Park has long been a delightful on-screen presence, but he's now ready to get behind the camera. Variety described Park's new dramedy ""Shortcomings"" as a ""fresh-faced, funny directorial debut"" for the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" star. From Sony Pictures Classics, the movie follows a struggling filmmaker, Ben (Justin H. Min), and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), who works for an Asian American film festival. ""When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want,"" the synopsis says. Sherry Cola stars as Ben's best friend Alice. Sony also described Ben as a man who ""spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women"" and ""watching Criterion Collection DVDs."" Wait, is this play about us?
""Heart of Stone"" (Aug. 11)
Gal Gadot's future as Wonder Woman may be in doubt, but if that gig falls through, at least she's got a home in the Netflix ecosystem. After starring in the streamer's ""Red Notice,"" Gadot returns for another Netflix original film that she also produced, the spy thriller ""Heart of Stone,"" in which she plays secret agent Rachel Stone. She's the ""only intelligence operative who stands between her global, peace-keeping organization and the loss of its most valuable — and dangerous — asset, codenamed: The Heart,"" per Netflix. Jamie Dornan also stars. Director Tom Harper told Entertainment Weekly the aim is for the film to spawn a new female-led action series like James Bond. In its attempt to craft more original franchises, Netflix is leaving no stone unturned.
""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" (Aug. 11)
If ""Renfield"" got you in the mood for more Dracula on the big screen, Universal has another movie for you. From ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" director André Øvredal, ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is based on a chapter from the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" novel, ""The Captain's Log,"" in which Dracula travels on board a merchant ship and things don't end well for those aboard. ""Strange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship,"" per Universal. Think of it as ""Alien,"" but on a boat and with Dracula instead of a Xenomorph. Corey Hawkins and Liam Cunningham star, and Javier Botet plays Dracula. With their help, for now, the Universal monsters franchise is alive.
""Gran Turismo"" (Aug. 11)
The race to find the next great video game movie is shifting gears with ""Gran Turismo."" David Harbour and Orlando Bloom star in this film based on the popular racing video games, though it's not a direct adaptation of them. Instead, it's inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, who became an actual race car driver after playing the video game competitively. The stakes are high for director Neill Blomkamp, who has struggled to follow up his critically-acclaimed debut film, 2009's ""District 9;"" his last two movies, ""Chappie"" and ""Demonic,"" were both widely panned. Can bringing a racing game to the big screen get his career back on track?
""Blue Beetle"" (Aug. 18)
The end of the DC universe as we know it is in sight, but it's not quite over yet. The DC Extended Universe still has two more films left before new boss James Gunn reboots the franchise. First up is ""Blue Beetle,"" in which a young college graduate, played by Xolo Maridueña, ""unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab,"" which ""chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host,"" leading him to become the superhero Blue Beetle, per Warner Bros. Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first character of the new DC universe, suggesting he could stick around even after the upcoming reboot. But that likely depends on how well this film performs, as if it's another DC bomb, expect the character to be tossed aside as quickly as Ezra Miller's Flash.
""Strays"" (Aug. 18)
In June, Jennifer Lawrence did her part to keep comedies alive in theaters with ""No Hard Feelings,"" and ""Strays"" is now picking up the torch. This new comedy produced by ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller has a unique hook: it's a filthy, R-rated film starring a bunch of talking dogs. The pups ""hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie,"" a Border Terrier voiced by Will Ferrell, ""find his way home"" and make his ""lowlife owner"" pay for abandoning him. Jamie Foxx and Will Forte also flesh out the voice cast, and Dennis Quaid appears in the movie as himself. Will this barking dog comedy have bite?
""Bottoms"" (Aug. 25)
Two of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood today are Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri, but fans introduced to them though ""Shiva Baby"" and ""The Bear"" may not realize the two collaborated in 2020 on the digital shorts ""Ayo and Rachel Are Single."" Three years later, they're teaming back up for the raunchy sex comedy ""Bottoms,"" in which two girls ""start a fight club as a way to lose their virginities to cheerleaders,"" per MGM. Emma Seligman directed the film in her follow-up to ""Shiva Baby,"" and Sennott co-wrote it with Seligman. Marshawn Lynch also stars. The movie earned near universal acclaim at South by Southwest, with Mashable's Kristy Puchko calling it a ""ruthless and hysterical parody of the teen sex comedy."" This is one fight club everyone will be talking about.
""Retribution"" (Aug. 25)
We've got five words for you: ""Speed,"" but with Liam Neeson. If you're not already on board, you should be. The actor leads this new action-thriller in which a man receives a call from a mysterious person who tells him there's a bomb under his car seat. The caller demands he ""complete a specific series of tasks,"" and with ""his kids trapped in the back seat and a bomb that will explode if they get out of the car, a normal commute becomes a twisted game of life or death,"" per Lionsgate. Nimród Antal, the filmmaker behind 2010's ""Predators,"" directs, and Jack Champion and Matthew Modine also star. Following new blockbusters starring Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, it's the perfect conclusion to the summer of aging action stars proving they've still got it.

The highly-stylized take on the Ninja Turtles represents the fourth swing at a theatrical franchise and the seventh installment to be released in movie theaters.
Inspired by movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a new generation of ambitious animated movies like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem have started to seep into the blockbuster space, giving a cool, tactile update to properties that had previously been fairly by-the-numbers in terms of their style, even when the scripts themselves were strong.
""We wanted it to be like Stand By Me and Lady Bird. But, you know, with Ninja Turtles,"" director Jeff Rowe described. ""They've got a lot of that inauthentic confidence that teenagers have: when you're a teen, you don't know any better, so you operate with this hyped-up sense of, 'We can do anything!' That's something that [they] are great at – that Superbad thing where they're best friends, but they're kinda losers who make fun of each other, but you never doubt for a second that they truly love each other.""
According to the film's official synopsis, ""In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. Their new friend April O'Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.""

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back! This time in a brand new movie, with comedy legend Seth Rogen producing and writing.
In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, everyone’s favourite heroes in a half-shell return, after years of being sheltered from the human world, and they are intent on winning the hearts of New Yorkers and becoming accepted as normal teenagers through their heroic acts. However, when their pal April O’Neil helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, they end up over their heads.
Regarding taking on the project, huge TNTM fan Seth Rogen told FM104: “It is kind of a dream come true. And it's one of those things that young me would be pretty psyched to know that future him, despite, you know, having a terrible back problem for the most part, also gets to work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!”
He added: “‘So, being in your 40s, there's good and bad things’, I would tell young Seth. ‘But overall, it's pretty exciting’.”
Seth, who also features in the film alongside John Cena, as Rocksteady and Bebop, continued: “A lot of the characters in the movie are inspired by the toys that me and Jeff [Rowe], the director, had. Like Mondo Gecko was not a very significant part of the show, or anything like that. But the toy was always one of our favourite toys.”
The film features the voices of Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon as the four turtles. Knocked Up and Superbad legend Rogen said: “We would have them improvise most of their lines. And we would encourage them to really speak over one another and interrupt one another and be as disrespectful to one another’s conversation as you would be with your brothers, who you're with all the time.
“The first recording session we had, I remember going to the director and the other producers and being like, ‘Oh, we have to record them to capture this energy that they actually have with each other, which is insane’.”
The voice cast also includes the likes of Rose Byrne and Maya Rudolph from Bridesmaids, as well as Stath Lets Flats’ Natasia Demetriou, Ant-Man’s Paul Rudd, and the legendary Jackie Chan. Of the latter, Rogen said: “I'm obsessed with Jackie Chan and I genuinely think he's, like, the greatest living comedian today. And so, the fact that he said ‘yes’ and is in the movie, and I got to work with him and be a part of those sessions and feed him lines and see him improvise and things like that, it's really surreal.”

2023-08-11 22:51:17+00:00,Chris Pine has a cameo in the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles newest film, Mutant Mayhem, has a blink and you miss it cameo from Chris Pine, well, sorta.","Why did the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds higher ups debut *that* character? by Chad Porto
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem had an unexpected Chris Pine cameo.
The sixth movie from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise premiered on Aug. 2, 2023, and is trending well with critics and fans alike. The new film, entitled, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem features the four titular teenage turtles as such, teenagers, who are lost and unsure about themselves as they move through the world.
It’s a heartfelt story, led by some wonderful voice work from the four young actors playing the titular Ninja Turtles. And while the four main characters were voiced by mostly unknown actors, the film still carries a hefty roster including Jackie Chan, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube, Hannibal Buress, and Paul Rudd.
Yet, despite all the big names that the film brought in to help support the young core cast, the film still found a way to fit in Chris Pine. Well, kinda, sorta.
Star Trek’s Chris Pine makes cameo in Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Pine’s cameo comes unannounced, and rather unexpected because he technically doesn’t appear in the film. In fact, it wasn’t Pine, so much as a cardboard cutout of his Star Trek character, James T. Kirk, which appears.
During a scene where Master Splinter is trying to convince his four teenage turtle sons to stay in the sewers and give up on trying to fit in among the humans, he pulls out three cardboard cutouts of various celebrities. One of those celebrations was in fact Pine as James Kirk.
While surprising to see a “Star Trek character” in the film, it’s not unexpected, as they’re both Paramount properties. Not only did Pine’s Kirk make a brief cameo, but so did the face of Nickelodeon, SpongeBob SquarePants.
The synergy was real in the film, as Paramount tries to bolster its animated offerings going forward. That said, while fans and critics alike have enjoyed the film, it doesn’t appear to be a financial success as it hasn’t even broken even with its budget, let alone the budget plus advertising.
If the TMNT film franchise can’t turn a profit, that will in fact hurt how Paramount views this, and other established animated IPs. Including those offered by Star Trek.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vcmVkc2hpcnRzYWx3YXlzZGllLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzExL2NocmlzLXBpbmUtaGFzLWEtY2FtZW8taW4tdGhlLW5ldy10ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW1vdmllL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-05 15:16:39+00:00,"Box Office: ‘TMNT,’ ‘Meg 2’ Racing Against ‘Oppenheimer’ for Second as ‘Barbie’ Reign Continues","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and ""Meg 2: The Trench"" openings look to take second from ""Oppenheimer,"" as ""Barbie"" stays on top.","The summer box office season may have reached the dog days of August, but it’s hardly looked stronger over the past few months. Though the openings of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Meg 2: The Trench” won’t be able to take down “Barbie” as the top performer in North America, both new releases are boosting theaters to a weekend with four different features grossing north of $25 million.
Paramount Pictures’ “Mutant Mayhem” added $9.3 million from 3,858 locations on Friday, tracking neck-and-neck with “Oppenheimer” for second place on domestic charts. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, opened with Tuesday evening preview screenings and is now tracking for a $42 million five-day debut — squarely within the projections of $35 million to $45 million heading into the weekend.
That’s not shabby for the “TMNT” entry, which cost only $70 million to produce — an especially economical figure for an animated studio release. Paramount has managed to capitalize on strong buzz as both an effective nostalgia play and a modern spin on the ’80s property. The 90% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes brought momentum into the weekend, and the glowing “A” grade through research firm Cinema Score shows early audiences are digging the latest adventures of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. As the summer season winds down, “Mutant Mayhem” should find some steady play.
The “TMNT” entry features a celebrity voice cast including Jackie Chan, Ayo Edebiri, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Ice Cube and Seth Rogen, plus a group of young stars — Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon — voicing the Turtle Brothers, emphasizing the first “T” of “TMNT.” Jeff Rowe directs.
Meanwhile, “Meg 2: The Trench” chowed down on $12 million from 3,503 theaters on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.2 million in Thursday previews. The hungry, hungry sequel from Warner Bros. is still tracking for an opening with a ceiling of $30 million. That’s a chunk behind the 2018 original, which saw Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against two gigantic sharks. “The Meg” earned $45 million in its domestic opening and finished with $145 million in North America and $530 million worldwide.
As its predecessor did, “The Trench,” which sees Jason Statham lead a group of scientists against even more gigantic sharks, will look to international territories as its main course to replenish a $129 million production budget. Notably, the sequel adds Wu Jing to its cast — a colossal star in China who has anchored local mega-hits such as “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” “Wolf Warrior” and “The Wandering Earth.” In fact, though Wu’s character perished in the first “Wandering Earth” entry, its follow-up was conceived as a prequel so that the actor could return to star.
Not that the first “Meg” was an awards season heavyweight, but “The Trench” hasn’t performed well in reviews (a 33% from top critics on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences also seem to be cooler on the sequel, turning in a “B” grade on Cinema Score, down from the “B+” earned by the first entry. Consensus opinion may be that the franchise has jumped the… well… but a spectacular reception would’ve marked a bit of a marketing misdirect, to put it frankly.
“Meg 2: The Trench” sees Statham and Wu team up with Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, Cliff Curtis and Sienna Guillory to take down not one, not two, but three prehistoric sharks, along with a bunch of other sea creatures. Beguilingly, the feature is based on a novel, “The Trench” by Steve Alten, and helmed by “Kill List” and “High-Rise” director Ben Wheatley, making the jump to big-budget filmmaking.
Neither sharks nor turtles can take down “Barbie” though, which added $17 million on Friday, down only 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. release has been a dominant force since scoring the biggest opening of the year and there aren’t really any signs of stopping. The hot-pink comedy will likely surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales within the next day or two.
Still the hottest ticket in the nation, “Barbie” should surge beyond a $450 million domestic gross through Sunday, placing it hot on the heels of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) to become the highest-earning North American release of the year.
It’ll be a close call for “Oppenheimer,” which may finally need to surrender second place on domestic charts to “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” or “Meg 2: The Trench.” Then again, it may not. The Christopher Nolan feature is projecting $28.7 million for the weekend, which would be down an impressively slim 39% from its previous outing.
The sweeping biopic has surpassed $200 million in North America and looks to keep playing through August, already having extended its tenure in Imax auditoriums. It’s a formidable performance for such a grim chatterbox of a film, which ranks among Nolan’s top four domestic grossers ever after just two weeks of release.
The floor is collapsing under Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which earned $2.6 million on its second Friday, down a staggering 73% from its debut. The family-friendly funhouse feature should push beyond a $40 million domestic gross on Saturday — not exactly the desired return for a film with a $150 million production budget. With plenty of competition for audiences’ attention, “Haunted Mansion” may be off to an early grave.
Notably, the unlikely summer hit “Sound of Freedom” continues to perform well in its sixth weekend of release. Competitors project the feature about child sex trafficking will drop only 39% this weekend, boosting its domestic haul to $164 million — enough to surpass “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” ($156 million) to become one of the top 10 highest-grossing North American releases of the year.
The Angel Studios release has drawn a substantial amount of skepticism among box office watchers. After the credits roll on the thriller, star Jim Caviezel appears on screen to speak directly to audiences, saying that he believes “we can make ‘Sound of Freedom’ the ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of 21st-century slavery” and presenting a QR code that directs viewers to the distributor’s unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing users to donate money to Angel Studios so that it may purchase tickets for its own film and distribute them to those that request free admission. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness of its subject matter.
It’s unclear to what degree the program has buoyed the box office fortunes of “Sound of Freedom,” but religious and conservative media groups have rallied behind the feature and a superlative “A+” grade on Cinema Score indicates that its audience is certainly enthusiastic about it. And regardless, those “Pay It Forward” ticket sales are still putting money in the pocket of exhibitors — whether people show up or not.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvdG1udC1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLW1lZy0yLXRyZW5jaC1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtd2Vla2VuZC10aHJlZS0xMjM1Njg4NTE3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-08 20:28:29+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’,The director Jeff Rowe narrates a sequence from his animated film.,"Hi, I’m Jeff Rowe. I’m the director of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.” Woo hoo! “This is going to be the Turtles’ first time encountering humans and the first time that we get to see them fight or be crime fighters in the way that the Ninja Turtles traditionally are. And we really wanted to make them not good at it.” I’ve never actually been a fight before, and I don’t know if you noticed, but all I’ve got is a big stick. How did I end up with a big stick? Maybe we diffuse this sitch with laughter. You’re not funny enough for that, dude. Enough talk! “We studied a lot of Jackie Chan movies, and something that’s really appealing is he always kind of starts at a disadvantage and then has to work his way up and fight through tons of people. And it was important to us to start the Turtles similarly and make it feel really grounded and real. So all of the action, all of the choreography here was designed to be tactile and real and not physics-defying and use objects that are just found within the scene and really see them struggle and get injured and take hits and fail, and then also see them be happy when they succeed. So the lighting and color in this scene and the very saturated colors and high contrast kind of was inspired by the street photography of Alex Webb. That Mikey back flip is maybe the most fantastical thing that happens in the fight. We wanted to define our own style, so we picked these like really bold colors, just like red light coming in through the windows. And then it left us with this problem where we’re like, How do we create visual progression throughout the sequence when the lighting stays that rigid? And then we’re like, okay, great, if something catches on fire, then we can fill the room with flame and then everything goes orange, and then they can put the flames out and it becomes a darker space and all of a sudden the car starts chasing them and we lean into the lighting of the headlights and our vendor partner Mikros found this really beautiful, gorgeous technique for rendering volumetric light where you see scribbles in it. All of the effects in here, all of the smoke is 2-D animation done on top of the 3-D. So it’s got that really scribbly, hand-drawn quality. We were looking at like Stan Brakhage films, like experimental animation, like scratching on the film negative to try and create something that was chaotic and not traditionally beautiful in the animated sense. And it’s just this tense, funny moment where the characters are trying to deal with a car that, if it hits them, will likely flatten them.” Woo-hoo! Yeah! We did it!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL3ZpZGVvL21vdmllcy8xMDAwMDAwMDkwMzE4NDgvdGVlbmFtZ2UtbXV0YW50LW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZXMtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1zY2VuZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Castillo recently shared some of his alternate designs for April O'Neill, and we now have a look at his early artwork for the Heroes in a Half-Shell's wise mentor/father, Splinter.
Unlike the April designs, these don't look much different to the version of Splinter we saw in the movie (those somewhat unsettling x-ray-style sketches are simply to illustrate his facial structure), but the animated reboot's take on the character was quite a departure.
Generally depicted as a calm, extremely skilled sensei, Splinter was reimagined as a lonely, overly-concerned dad who longs for someone to share his life with. It works for this take on the TMNT, but some long-time fans have taken issue with this and certain other changes to the ""established"" lore.
Spoilers follow.
At the end of the movie, Splinter does find that special someone in the form of... Scumbug!

Below, we’ve highlighted five of the biggest animation stories from this year’s event.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
Paramount screened more than 20 minutes of new footage from August’s most hyped animated feature release. The full presentation isn’t available online, but the studio has posted the first 30 seconds, which provides the most detailed look and listen yet at Jackie Chan’s Master Splinter.
Bonus News: Nickelodeon revealed that it has acquired broadcast rights to the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake
Warner Bros. shared a trailer and announced an August 31 release date for Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake, a more adult spinoff of the classic Cartoon Network series. The show follows Fionna the human and Cake the cat, who first appeared in the third season of the original Adventure Time.
Synopsis: “Fionna and Cake – with the help of the former Ice King, Simon Petrikov – embark on a multiverse-hopping adventure and journey of self-discovery. All the while a powerful new antagonist determined to track them down and erase them from existence lurks in the shadows.”
Rick and Morty: The Anime
Adult Swim shared the first extended look at its upcoming Rick and Morty anime series as well as a bit of BTS info, announced in May of last year. The 10-episode show is directed by Takashi Sano, who features in the video, and produced by Animation Film.
Synopsis: The multiverse-straddling exploits of Rick and the gang pose challenges to the family bond, but they always rise to the occasion,” Sano explained. “It’s such a life affirming sight, and Jerry is no exception. I am honored to have been given an opportunity to tell a new story about this amazing family. I hope you enjoy their adventures!
Bonus News: We also learned that the search for a replacement voice actor for original Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland is nearing its end.
Crisis on Infinite Earths and Watchmen
DC announced two new animated movies for a pair of its most popular graphic novels, Crisis on Infinite Earths and Watchmen. According to the company, both films are already being worked on and should be released sometime in 2024. Both properties have been adapted in live action previously, but this is the first time that either is getting an animated feature.
New Seasons of Harley Quinn and Invincible
One of Max’s biggest recent animation success stories will return for a fourth season in just a few days. Warner Bros. Discovery promoted the premiere with a new two-minute trailer during its Max Original Animation panel.
Prime Video debuted the season two trailer for its very adult superhero animated series Invincible ahead of that show’s November 3 return. Season one debuted in the spring of 2021 and was such a huge hit that Amazon ordered two more seasons before the first had even finished airing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnRvb25icmV3LmNvbS9ldmVudHMvY29taWMtY29uLWZpdmUtYmlnLWFuaW1hdGlvbi1zdG9yaWVzLTIzMDgxMC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-31 15:01:18+00:00,"'TMNT' Co-Creator Confirms Disappointing News for ""Last Ronin"" Fans - Inside the Magic","It might be a great week for 'TMNT' fans, but this is bad news.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will likely take theaters by storm over the next few weeks. This year has seen its fair share of blockbusters take a massive slice out of the box office, including Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023). However, it’s animated films that seem to be the dominant force of cinema in 2023.
Across the Spider-Verse (2023) caught $682.4 million on its web and became Sony Pictures Animation’s highest-grossing film, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) grossed $1.355 billion worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing animated films ever.
Needless to say, the CG-animated Mutant Mayhem stands a solid chance at success. The film is also being heavily marketed in a similar fashion to Barbie (minus all the many shades of pink, of course), which echoes “Turtle-Mania” from the early ’90s.
In fact, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures are so confident Mutant Mayhem will turn in a huge profit that they’ve already announced the film is the first installment in a shared universe, with a 2D animated series set to follow the movie on Paramount+ this year.
So it makes sense that Nickelodeon isn’t letting anything stand in the film’s way — not even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

It turns out Nickelodeon is king when it comes to the TMNT property, so much so that they appear to have already stopped another Ninja Turtles reboot from hitting the big screen, likely because it may interfere with the new Mutant Mayhem universe.

That reboot is “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020)…

What is “The Last Ronin”?

“The Last Ronin” is an ongoing comic book series from IDW Publishing, which has been churning out TMNT comic books since 2011. The series follows lone Ninja Turtle Michelangelo as he embarks on a one-way revenge mission to take on the man responsible for the deaths of his three brothers in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City.

The series now also has a follow-up titled “Lost Years,” which details the preceding years in which Michelangelo embarks on a quest to become the Last Ronin while, in the present day, introducing four brand-new Ninja Turtles, Odyn, Yin, Moja, and Uno, who are under the tutelage of newly-appointed sensei, Casey Marie Jones.

At this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that “The Last Ronin II — Re-Evolution” (2023) will arrive later this year.

Is “The Last Ronin” in a different universe?

“The Last Ronin” takes place in an alternate timeline now dubbed the “Ronin-verse.” However, it’s reasonable to consider that it follows on from the “present-day” IDW material, which is still ongoing.

The Ronin-verse is already expanding in the form of follow-ups such as “Lost Years,” the one-shot comic “Lost Day,” and the upcoming “Re-Evolution,” and also with many collectible action figures. There’s also a “Triple-A” video game in the works, although most fans would prefer a theatrical adaptation.

Will there be a “Last Ronin” movie?

Since it arrived in 2020, TMNT fans have been clamoring for a big-screen adaptation of “The Last Ronin.” In fact, fans have wanted a dark, gritty theatrical outing for well over three years. After all, this is the style and tone in which the Ninja Turtles first started in Mirage Comics, co-created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984.

Unfortunately, it looks like “The Last Ronin” won’t be getting the big screen treatment, or the small screen treatment for that matter — at least not anytime soon.

In an interview with ComicBook.com, Kevin Eastman discussed the fact fans have been hoping for a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” but explained that Nickelodeon came up with the idea of going down the video game route instead.

“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take “The Last Ronin” concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While Nickelodeon could easily adopt DC’s “Elseworlds” strategy, which isolates films such as Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) from its shared universe installments, it looks like the universe established in Mutant Mayhem is their number one priority.

This may come as very disappointing news for fans of “The Last Ronin,” but there is a short, CG-animated, fan-made film on YouTube worth checking out. And then, of course, there’s the upcoming video game based on the ongoing comic book series.

When is “The Last Ronin” game out?

There’s currently no release date for “The Last Ronin” video game, though we do know it is inspired by the popular God of War video game series.

Earlier this year, Doug Rosen, Senior Vice President for Games and Emerging Media at Paramount Global, said the game would focus only on Michelangelo. However, he added that Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, who only appear in the comics through hallucinations and flashbacks, may also appear in a playable format in flashback sequences.

Rosen also said that the mature themes of The Last Ronin (TBA) would not be “dialed back to make the game something it shouldn’t be.”

“TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) made waves when it first arrived back in 2020, becoming a critical and financial hit, storming to the top of The New York Times best-sellers list, and transforming the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise forever.

The story finds the lone surviving Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo, embarking on a one-way mission to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter, in a futuristic and dystopian New York City.

Now, fans are poring over the second, five-part series “The Lost Years” (2023), the prequel/sequel to “The Last Ronin”, which expands upon “the lost years” that precede Michelangelo’s long-awaited return to New York, while also introducing the Turtles’ “replacements.”

The end of the first series sees Michelangelo successfully avenge the deaths of his three brothers after a bloody battle against New York City dictator Oroku Hiroto (The Shredder’s grandson). However, he is also fatally wounded in the fight.

But the final scene reveals that April O’Neil’s daughter, Casey Marie, a pivotal figure in the rebellion against Oroku Hiroto, has started to raise four baby mutant turtles in the original Ninja Turtles’ sewer lair, and this is where “The Lost Years” picks up.

It would be a lie to say that the current series is split halfway down the middle where its prequel/sequel commitments are concerned. Any focus on the four new turtles, Odyn, Moja, Yi, and Uno, is limited to only a handful of panels in each issue.

But this isn’t a criticism — undoubtedly, the creators are drip-feeding these new characters into our lives without shifting the focus from Michelangelo entirely. The last original Ninja Turtle will most likely be gone forever once this series ends.

Each issue leaps forward three years, so by the time we arrive at Issue #4, the new turtles are, as the story describes, “pre-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” But unlike the previous three issues, they’re now finally being trained on how to fight by their sensei, Casey Marie.

While their scene in the latest TMNT installment is just as fleeting as those in previous issues, it’s great to finally see them in action, even if the fight does turn out to be nothing more than a simulation, with Casey preparing them for the real world above.

It’s also likely that the final issue, which releases in late July, will feature more from them, which makes sense given that “The Lost Day,” a one-shot comic that hits shelves in late August, will follow these them in their entirety, as they officially replace the original Ninja Turtles.

IDW Publishing’s main “TMNT” comic book series is still ongoing. At the same time “The Last Ronin,” which takes place in an alternate timeline, is also set to continue, as co-creator Kevin Eastman previously confirmed that a third series is already in development.

But while the primary canon will continue, it seems fans are far more interested in “The Last Ronin.” Not only are waves of new toys based on the dark and gritty comic book series hitting shelves, but a brand-new “AAA game” is in the works, which is said to be heavily inspired by the Gods of War game series.

As per IDW, here’s the synopsis for “The Last Ronin — Lost Years”:

RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In the smash-hit miniseries TMNT: The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time — past, present, future — to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half Shell. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heart-breaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artist Ben Bishop (TMNT: The Last Ronin) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of… Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is bursting with action, silliness, and emotion – here’s our review.

While their father, mutant rat Splinter (Jackie Chan) is desperate to keep them away from the cruel, violent and judgmental outside world, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will do anything to be a part of it. Attempting to win over the people of New York with acts of heroism, under the guidance of human ally April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri), they decide to take on criminal mastermind Superfly (Ice Cube). Mayhem, involving mutants, ensues.

What an energizing and refreshing movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is. The film’s look, an imperfect, sketch-styled animation that takes place at night under streetlights and neon signs, is incredible. The pace, the sound, the script, the characters; everything is so full of life and movement. Released in a glut of summer blockbusters where it can be hard to work out which movies will be tired and formulaic, this is a full on blast of fresh and invigorated filmmaking.

The action sequences are visually engaging and exciting – clear, colourful and buzzing with adrenaline. It’s the antithesis of the overloaded CGI that has plagued some other recent films (leading to action sequences produced on blockbuster budgets that are little more than pixel–mulch). The scenes here are thrilling; the final battle in particular is a big, bombastic climax.

While the striking animation style is likely to grab your attention, everything in this film spins out of the youthful and excitable version of the Turtles. With Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon) and Michaelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) all played by voice actors who are actually teenagers, the Turtles have never felt like a more real and relatable group of kids. From that comes this loose animation style, excitable visual asides and fully charged action sequences.

The script comes from Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jeff Rowe, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit (with ‘story by’ credits for Rogen, Goldberg Rowe and Brendan O’Brien, and based on credits for Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird). It performs an incredible balancing act, infusing a steady stream of jokes (every character gets a chance to be funny) with a story that builds to an excellent climactic battle and deeply satisfying ending. My only real complaint about Mutant Mayhem is that it potentially has too many characters; it’s not overstuffed, but I wanted more of some of the supporting characters.

Perhaps that’s because the cast is electric. The four Turtles are allowed to lead; their characters are immediately defined, and all are really likable and funny. Ice Cube appears to relish the role of Superfly, while Paul Rudd’s Mondo Gecko is an unstoppable scene stealer. Jackie Chan’s Splinter, too, is delightful and heartening.

Mutant Mayhem's action sequences can be quite intense. That’s because of the brilliant animation, of course, but they’re all pulled tight by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ score. Any ideas that Reznor had jettisoned his Nine Inch Nails credibility to make a zany cartoon score are way off the mark. The music is dark and imposing at times, beautiful and affecting at others.

While Mutant Mayhem will draw obvious (and warranted) comparisons to the Spiderverse movies due to its look (and it’s not particularly interesting to say but the movie is visually stunning), it also shares a director (Jeff Rowe) with the excellent The Mitchells Vs The Machines. Mitchells was produced by Lord and Miller at the same time as Into The Spiderverse, and Rowe’s movie certainly bears that experience. Mutant Mayhem is co-directed by Kyler Spears. There’s such a big creative team that seem to be sharing so many credits in Mutant Mayhem; rather than attempt pick out who deserves praise for what, it feels like a better idea to just celebrate everyone.

One of my favourite things about Mutant Mayhem is how gross it can get. It gets gloopy and disgusting. In that way, the movie itself is a bit like a teenager; at once sophisticated and juvenile. In capturing an authentic youthful feeling, in being slimy and gooey and silly, and in being a story about community and family, it feels like an elevation of everything Nickelodeon were doing in the 90s.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has this formidable, intense score, wonderful and funny character writing, a striking visual style and brilliantly exciting action sequences. It’s funny and gross and cool and sweet. All of these thing just come bursting out of this film in a big ball of infectious energy.

The team behind Mutant Mayhem has created something special. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise probably needed to be reinvigorated, but I’m so bored of reading about what films mean for franchises – whether this movie or that will allow some faceless corporate money machine to continue to try to draw growth percentages from the brands that they’ve bought.

Mutant Mayhem isn’t another piece of content puked out by an algorithm, it’s this awesome, exciting, uplifting movie about these outsider kids trying to find a place in the world. It can mean whatever it means for the branding – for your afternoon in the multiplex, it means you’re probably gonna have a fantastic time with this joyous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a film about mutants that is full of humanity. It is outrageous that the modern studio system was able to produce a TMNT movie this good.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is in cinemas now.

2023-08-13 12:09:46+00:00,'Mutant Mayhem' Actor Open to Returning in 'The Last Ronin' Movie - Inside the Magic,The 'Mutant Mayhem' actor is open to reprising his role in 'The Last Ronin' movie.,"This Mutant Mayhem actor wants to return for The Last Ronin movie.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is the latest iteration of TMNT in film. But unlike previous entries, this time all the focus is on the teenage aspects of the Ninja Turtles, while the film is easily the most family-friendly of all seven.

So, fans hoping for a dark and gritty take on the half-shell heroes, particularly those who are familiar with the ongoing comic book series, “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) from IDW Publishing, may walk away understandably disappointed.

While Mutant Mayhem is heavily marketed towards younger audiences, none of the films, or the numerous television shows, are geared towards adults, save for the original film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). But even that is quite cheesy in retrospect.

A genuinely adult-themed Ninja Turtles reboot, whether it’s on the big screen or the small screen, would definitely need to take a page out of the comic books, whether it’s the original run from Mirage Studios in the ’80s, or “The Last Ronin”.

“The Last Ronin” takes place in a futuristic and dystopian version of New York City, where an older Michelangelo embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of his three brothers, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello, and his father, Master Splinter.

A second series titled “Lost Years” (2023) is currently available, and it was announced at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con that a third series titled “Re-Evolution” is in the works, with the first issue available from December. The Last Ronin game is also now in development.

Recently, in an interview with ComicBook.com, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman commented on the possibility of a movie adaptation of “The Last Ronin”, while also sharing some details about The Last Ronin game.

Here are his full comments:

“Nickelodeon, who has always been a great partner and great friend to all the things in letting us do what we do, they really didn’t want to take ‘The Last Ronin’ concept into full on mainstream, like a big live-action movie, something to compete with Mutant Mayhem (which is gonna be phenomenally awesome),” Eastman explained. “They collectively came up with the idea of a video game because we could go all the way there. They could basically take it all the way into all things Ronin-verse. They’ve taken all the different drawings and moments… the stuff we’ve seen so far is goosebump city. It’s really phenomenal. They took stuff right out of the pages of the comic book.”

While The Last Ronin game sounds really exciting, unsurprisingly, when it comes to the big screen, Nickelodeon is clearly more focused on building a Mutant Mayhem shared universe. Not only has a sequel already been greenlit, a 2D animated follow-up series will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.

This isn’t great news for fans hoping for a live-action adaptation of The Last Ronin. Fortunately, The Last Ronin game will remedy some of that disappointment when it’s eventually released.

Either way, the popular comic book series is on the tip of everyone’s tongue, even when it comes to conversations about Mutant Mayhem. In an interview with YouTube channel Nerd Reactor, the brand-new Ninja Turtles actors were asked for their thoughts on “The Last Ronin.” Leonardo actor, Nicolas Cantu, who is clearly a fan of the comic books, was the first to respond, saying, “That is sick! That is sick!”

Brady Noon, who voices Raphael in the film, said to the interviewer, “You are the first person who has mentioned ‘The Last Ronin’!” before asking his co-stars, “Did you see the YouTube thing for it?”, referring to the popular fan film that imagines what a live-action adaptation of “The Last Ronin” might look like.

The interviewer then put a question to Shamon Brown Jr. who voices Michelangelo, saying, “Let’s say, in the future, people love this [Mutant Mayhem], the reception is well, and people are like, ‘Oh man I want to see older Mikey deal with [the death of his brothers!'”

Here’s what the actor said in response: “I would be open to that, for sure. You know the voice gets deeper a little bit and, you know, has to get a bit more gruesome, but it’s going to be amazing. Hey, we’ll see. It could be five to ten years from now, you never know.”

“Are you going to miss us?” Cantu jokingly asked his co-star. “Cuz we’re gone in that storyline!”

While Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael are indeed dead at the time “The Last Ronin” takes place, they still appear in the form of flashbacks and hallucinations, so there would certainly be room for Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Micah Abbey (Donatello) to appear alongside Shamon Brown Jr. They’d just need to be considerably older first.

Check out the interview below:

Even if The Last Ronin movie does eventually happen, it’s unlikely any of the Mutant Mayhem actors will ever end up reprising their roles, as Nickelodeon would likely want to keep the film as far from the Mutant Mayhem universe as possible. But who knows. One day, we could get a CG-animated Last Ronin movie as part of the “Mutant Mayhem-verse.”

Either way, who else could take on the role?

Who could play Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie?

Keanu Reeves

Keanu Reeves is no stranger to the martial arts, or taking down hordes of bad guys in neon-lit city settings as he sets out to exact vengeance upon a powerful enemy. If you’ve seen the John Wick films, you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Reeves’ gruff and somber voice would also be perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie.

Michael Shannon

Michael Shannon plays General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) and The Flash (2023), so he has plenty of experience with movies based on comic books. But it’s his role as Mr. Green in the comedy film The Night Before (2015) that oozes those “chilled out” Michelangelo vibes. More importantly, Shannon would bring a ton of grit to the role in The Last Ronin movie.

Chris Hemsworth

Chris Hemsworth also has experience with comic book movies as the God of Thunder, Thor, but we’re looking at his role as Tyler Rake in the Extraction films. Hemsworth also has the physique perfect for Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, and he’s also a great comedy actor, which would allow for the more “traditional” Mikey to surface from time to time.

Andy Serkis

Andy Serkis might not be the first actor you think of when casting a character like Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie, or any Turtle for that matter. However, Serkis is the king of motion-capture performance, whether it’s Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, King Kong in Peter Jackson’s 2005 epic, or Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy.

Iko Uwais

Iko Uwais is hardly a household name in these parts of the world, but he might just be the most suited candidate for playing Michelangelo in The Last Ronin movie. Uwais is best known for playing Rama in The Raid films, the adrenalin-charged Indonesian actioners. The actor’s mind-blowing fighting skills could prove an absolute game-changer .

Noel Fisher

There’s probably no better actor to play Michelangelo than, well, Michelangelo. It would seem unfair to give the character the motion-capture treatment again without considering Noel Fisher, who portrayed him in the two Michael Bay-produced reboots. The Last Ronin version of Mikey, however, would be very different to what you saw in those films.

These actors could even portray Michelangelo in The Last Ronin game, whether it’s through motion-capture performance or voice work. Unless Mutant Mayhem‘s Shamon Brown Jr. is confident about doing that deeper voice.

While there’s no film based on “The Last Ronin” in development, a trailer for The Last Ronin video game was released on Friday. Check it out below:

There’s no release date for The Last Ronin game. “The Last Ronin” comic books are all on sale now. The third series, “Re-Evolution”, goes on sale in December.

,TMNT Mutant Mayhem Found The Zombie Turtle Kid For The Best Viral Marketing Ever,"Remember the ""I like turtles"" kid? Well Paramount found him and implemented him into the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles marketing.","It’s been years since the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graced the big screen, but the superhero team is set to return next weekend with TMNT: Mutant Mayhem . As one of the next titles among 2023's new movie release dates prepares to hit theaters, Paramount has called upon a throwback meme to bring attention to its release, and the marketing idea is top tier.

Back in May 2007, 10-year-old Jonathan Ware went absolutely viral for appearing on a local news interview at the Rose Festival in Portland, Oregon. While in zombie makeup, a TV reporter turned the microphone to a kid attending the festivities to ask what he thought about the whole thing. He memorably responded with “I like turtles.” Over 16 years later, the marketing team behind the TMNT movie brought back the viral sensation for this bit:

Jonathan Ware is all grown up, in his mid-20s now, and yes, it is, in fact, the same Jonathan. He put the zombie makeup back on, and he got into character as his childhood self to say “I like turtles” to promote the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. Obviously, the recreation of the now-classic internet meme is already going viral!

Commenters took to TikTok to react with things like “NO WAY!!!!!!!! He’s all grown up,” “living legend” and “This is something I never knew I needed.” Considering most memes like this live and die with a single video, it’s quite the welcome jump scare to see Jonathan Ware as an adult in the zombie makeup doing the meme years later. We have to wonder what his reaction was when he was approached by Paramount and how much the viral gentlemen got for helping promote the new TMNT movie. Since we’re getting nostalgic, check out the original video that started it all:

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Rating: PG for sequences of violence and action, language and impolite material

Runtime: 99 minutes

It’s pretty clever marketing on Paramount’s part ahead of the animated movie hitting theaters next weekend. Critics have also seen Mutant Mayhem and are loving it, with many saying the movie walks a nice line between being very nostalgic and a fresh take on the franchise. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise has been around since the early ‘80s, beginning as comic books before becoming a mainstay in toy sections and getting its own video games and beloved animated series. This latest movie sees Seth Rogen and his longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg putting their own spin on the franchise.

This year feels like it’s been an especially great year for studios stepping up their campaigns, especially on social media, between M3GAN ’s viral marketing efforts and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie inspiring people to wear pink outfits to theaters. You can look forward to the latest TMNT movie hitting theaters next Friday, August 2… if you like turtles, that is.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RtbnQtbXV0YW50LW1heWhlbS1mb3VuZC16b21iaWUtMDAzODM4OTA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Untold: Jake Paul the Problem Child

Credit: Netflix

The YouTuber-to-""pro-boxer"" pipeline is by far one of the strangest, yet weirdly intriguing, phenomenon to take over the internet, and now we all get to watch a documentary about it. Netflix's Untold: Jake Paul the Problem Child follows famed former YouTuber Jake Paul as he explains his journey from online sensation to self-proclaimed professional boxer, including his various online controversies . Jake Paul has also faced multiple sexual assault allegations.

What we thought: ""Through interviews with coaches, challengers, supporters, and Paul's own family, the doc paints a flattering portrait of Paul as a scrappy newcomer reviving the sport while challenging its old guard. Those interviews also reveal new information about Paul's struggle to mediate his father's mental and physical abuse and, instead of confronting them, dangerously frames Paul's boxing obsession as a healthy way to channel his repressed trauma into a kind of productive — and lucrative — violence."" — Elizabeth de Luna, Culture Reporter

2023-07-03 14:46:44+00:00,"""New Turtles"" Teaser Finally Reveals Two Characters Now Portrayed by Female Actors - Inside the Magic",The new 'Turtles' teaser offers a glimpse of two characters who are now female.,"The “New Turtles” teaser finally reveals two characters now portrayed by female actors.

It’s no stretch to say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has always been a diverse franchise. 1997 saw the first female Turtle, Venus de Milo, in the live-action television series Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (1997).

Since then, there have been even more female Turtles in the long-running IDW Publishing comic book series, from human-turned-Turtle Jennika to the more recent Moja and Yi, who form part of the new line-up in the ongoing “TMNT: The Last Ronin” (2020) series.

Now, the CG-animated reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is set to be just as diverse. Not only is April O’Neil portrayed as African-American (voiced by African-American actress Ayo Edebiri), two TMNT villains are portrayed by female actors.

Those villains are mutant alligator Leatherhead and alien-in-human-form Cynthia Utrom, voiced by Bridesmaids (2011) duo Rose Byrne and Maya Rudolph, respectively. The long-standing character of Leatherhead has previously been portrayed as male in the many TMNT iterations, while Cynthia Utrom appears to be a version of the male villain Krang.

Now, we finally have our first look at both of these characters in a new promotional video titled “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem — The New Turtles,” in which producer Seth Rogen name-drops all the film’s characters and the actors who play them.

While we only see a still image of Cynthia Utrom (which is part of a series of newly revealed character posters for the film), we see Leatherhead in action, with Rose Byrne’s native Aussie accent, as she says, “G’day, fellas!”

These villains might not be anywhere near as iconic as the likes of Bebop and Rocksteady (who are voiced by Seth Rogen and John Cena in the upcoming film), but between this new change-up and the two new female Turtles in “The Last Ronin,” we could end up with an all-female TMNT movie one day.

From the shores of Hong Kong into Hollywood, Jackie Chan has come a long way in establishing himself as one of Asia's biggest stars. Chan has starred in several movies, including Rush Hour, Who Am I?, Police Story, The Legend of the Drunken Master, The Forbidden Kingdom, and many more. He is also an honorary Oscar Award winner and lends his voice talents to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which Chan is expected to participate in an announced sequel.

With several notable fight scenes under his belt, have you ever wondered how a guy like him lives? Well, wonder no more. This article features Jackie Chan's $14.3 million former mansion in Beverly Hills, Calif.

After making waves in the Chinese movie scene, it isn't surprising that Chan's skills in martial arts and acrobatics eventually elevated him to become a world-class action star. With projects in Hollywood, it isn't surprising that the Rush Hour star picked up a mansion in California to be close to Hollywood.

For the property purchase, Chan reportedly took out $3 million from his pockets in 1998. About 10 years later, the honorary Oscar Award winner sold it for $6.3 million. However, as of writing, the mansion is valued around $14.3 million.

Here are some photos of Jackie Chan's $14.3 million former mansion in Beverly Hills.

Originally constructed in 1986, Chan's former mansion encompasses 7,638 square feet of living space. It includes five bedrooms and seven bathrooms.

The main features of Chan's former property include a spacious living room, a formal dining area, a family room, a bar, a gourmet kitchen equipped with top-quality appliances while also including a breakfast nook, and a master bedroom with a fireplace, a luxurious bathroom, dual walk-in closets, and a sitting area.

While the indoors is already impressive, the same is true about the exterior of the home. The backyard features a swimming pool with a spa, a poolside lounge area, and plenty of green spaces filled with various plant life that's ideal for planting and gardening.

Furthermore, Chan's former Beverly Hills abode also not only drew him closer to Hollywood, but it also gave him access to several establishments and restaurants on the popular Rodeo Drive.

Chan is a well-accomplished action star. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Chan has a net worth of around $400 million. As a result, it isn't surprising that The Forbidden Kingdom star can afford to live a luxurious lifestyle. Apart from a lucrative acting career, Chan also rakes in a lot of money as a producer.

Mutant mayhem has descended on Manchester as a city-wide street art trail of much-loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters – Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello – has been unveiled. Hidden across the city, fans can find the turtles up to mischief, with the uniquely created hand-painted artwork that matches the new, distinct hand-drawn style of animation in the upcoming film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

A team of six street artists Woskerski, Brezaux, Captain Kris, Oust, Reves One and Sidok, part of the Blank Walls artist collective, created the mini-murals over six days around the city taking a total of 192 hours and using 448 cans of paint. Fans will see Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey doing some of their favourite activities, including performing ninja tricks, tucking into pizza and skateboarding, as part of the trail commissioned by Paramount Pictures and supported by Manchester City Centre BID.

The artwork has been unveiled ahead of the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, in cinemas on July 31.

The characters were first introduced to the world in 1984 through a comic book, and since then have become firm favourites with kids and teenagers all over the world through TV and film adaptations. The street art trail matches the new, hand-drawn animation style featured in the upcoming film and will appeal to all the generations of fans who have grown up with the ninja turtles through the last four decades.

,Seth Rogen Talks Remaking 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Starring Actual Teenagers (Exclusive),'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' hits theaters on Aug. 2.,"Everyone's favorite sewer-dwelling, pizza-gobbling, crime-fighting reptiles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, but this time there's one major difference -- the titular turtles are actually played by teenagers!

""They're often middle-aged men doing Teenage-Voiced Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" joked Seth Rogen when he sat down with ET's Will Marfuggi to talk about how a life-long love of the titular turtles led to writing and producing the latest installment in the long-running franchise.

""I was really the target audience for the first iteration of all this stuff,"" he explained, noting that he watched the TMNT cartoons and movies as a kid and was ""obsessed"" with the toys. ""My dad bought like, a big box of used Ninja Turtle toys at a garage sale when I was a kid, and so I had those and I played with them so much.""

However, Rogen admitted, ""I always thought that the 'Teenage' part of it was weirdly under-explored, you know?""

For his movie, the Dumb Money star added in more details about the turtles' desire to be just regular teens, and wanted the cast to be made up of voice actors that were closer in age to their characters than past iterations.

The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star Brady Noon, 17, is Raphael, the bravest and strongest -- but also most impulsive -- of his brothers, who wears a red mask and fights with two pronged sai weapons.

Paramount Pictures

The Amazing World of Gumball's Nicolas Cantu, 19, plays Leonardo, ""the leader and the most honorable and responsible"" of the turtles, who wears blue and wields two katana.

Paramount Pictures

Cousins for Life star Micah Abbey, 15, plays the ""wise and resourceful"" Donatello, who wears a purple mask and wields a bō staff.

Paramount Pictures

And The Chi's Shamon Brown Jr., 19, is Michelangelo, the heart and charismatic soul of the family. ""Mikey,"" as his brothers call him, dons an orange mask and primarily fights with nunchucks, though he's wielded other weapons throughout the years.

Paramount Pictures

""It's always [been] the same kind of energy, from the beginning,"" Brown Jr. said of stepping into a beloved role that multiple actors have played throughout the years. ""Mikey, personally, being like the funny one and you know, the loving one, I kind of embodied that in to this, just [adding] the modern day feel to it.""

Part of that modern feel, Rogen admitted, came from letting the core foursome improvise and inject some modern-day teen speak to make up for the old, outdated ""cowabungas"" -- which would feel totally anachronistic in 2023.

""I think it was so important that the freedom that Jeff [Rowe, Mutant Mayhem director] and Seth gave us and kind of the trust that they put into us being like, 'I think these kids know the generation better then we do as older men,'"" Noon shared, earning a guffaw from Rogen. ""I think that that was really important that we just had that trust and [knew] certain slangs that we can put into the film to make it better understanding for our generation.""

""Most of it was just Seth and Jeff giving us like, the reins to be crazy,"" Cantu agreed, recalling that Rogen and Rowe would often hear the boys joking around off-camera and ask them to recreate the dialogue in the booth.

""We cast them well and we just knew if they were essentially themselves, honestly, that it would convey the right dynamic and it would be the right energy,"" Rogen noted. ""That was like so helpful and it's why the movie feels natural, and I think why you stop thinking of them as turtles and you start thinking of them as teenagers within like, 30 seconds of seeing them on screen.""

For Rogen, it was an exercise in feeling a bit out of his depth as a writer.

""A large part of it was acknowledging, like, I don't know how these kids talk anymore,"" he admitted. ""When we wrote Superbad, we had such a handle of how 18-year-olds in 2004 spoke, you know what I mean? But now it's like 20 years later... We don't want to sound like 40-year-old men writing for teenagers.""

""I don't know half the stuff they say in the movie,"" he joked, teasing the cast, ""I signed off on it. I've heard since that it's really offensive.""

The film also stars Jackie Chan as Master Splinter, Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil, Ice Cube as Superfly, Rogen as Bebop, John Cena as Rocksteady, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, Giancarlo Esposito and Maya Rudolph.

Made with $70 million, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hit theatres on 3 August 2023. The Jeff Rowe-directed animated movie opened to $10.2 million on Wednesday which includes the Tuesday preview collection of $3.8 million. The movie was in the number two spot right behind Barbie and ahead of Oppenheimer.

As per projection, the movie is expected to gross over $30 million in its five-day opening while the movie is being poured with good critical reception, some even estimated that it could go as high as $40 million in the opening. The success of the reboot of the famous comic book series has opened doors to new installments to add to the franchise, or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Universe in general as Paramount+ confirmed a spin-off series.

Jeff Rowe on Jackie Chan as Splinter

The announcement of Chan playing Splinter shocked many fans but he was also relatable to the character, at least the director of the movie believed. “We wanted him to do this and we had no idea,” Jeff Rowe, the director told IGN about casting Chan during the interview at San Diego Comic-Con live show. “We were like, ‘he’ll never say yes to this but let’s try it.’ But he was in. He was familiar with the franchise.”

“We needed Splinter to be this loving dad character and Splinter’s got some crazy notions about humans, and he’s also pretty strict with the kids. And you need someone who’s just so likable and loveable that even when Splinter’s being hard, the audience doesn’t turn on him. You still like him and love him.”

Splinter, the director said, as a father figure was best suited for Chan and he was glad to have him onboard. “It felt important to really make them a family and explore that style of family, where it’s single dad, four kids,” Rowe said. “He’s trying his best and it’s really hard because he did not expect to become a father,” he added. The movie is heading to a promising opening and as the movie has officially got a sequel, Chan will reprise his role with the twisted humor alongside Cena.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is currently showing in theatres.
