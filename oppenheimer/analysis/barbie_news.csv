LOS ANGELES, July 24 (Reuters) - Barbie's record-breaking debut at cinemas over the weekend landed higher than initial estimates with $162 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada, distributor Warner Bros said (WBD.O) on Monday.
The final Friday to Sunday tally for the ""Barbie"" movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was slightly higher than the $155 million the studio estimated on Sunday.
""Barbie"" is the No.1 movie of the year based on domestic opening weekend sales, beating the $146.4 million haul for April release ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie.""
Director Greta Gerwig's take on the Mattel Inc (MAT.O) doll also added $194.3 million in 63 international markets for a global debut of $356.3 million.
""Barbie"" faced off against director Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" in a box office battle dubbed ""Barbenheimer.""
Final numbers also rose for ""Oppenheimer."" The story of the making of the atomic bomb brought in $82.4 million in the United States and Canada from Friday through Sunday, up from the earlier estimate of $80.5 million.
In 78 international markets, ""Oppenheimer"" collected nearly $98.0 million for a global total of $180.4 million.
Both movies beat expectations and helped the U.S. and Canadian box office surpass $300 million for just the fourth time in history.

,What's the 'Barbie' movie run time? Details to know about summer blockbuster film,"Were you among the thousands that went to see ""Barbie"" this weekend. If you didn't, here is what you need to know.","El Pasoans, from moms and daughters to teenagers, families and couples, were among the crowds of people nationwide that gave ""Barbie"" its record-breaking weekend. The film opened July 19 in theaters nationwide and is directed by Greta Gerwig.
The Warner Bros. film claimed the top spot with a whopping $155 million in ticket sales from North American theaters, surpassing ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first-weekend record for a film directed by a woman, according to the Associated Press.
Fans of Barbie, from grown women who grew up playing with the dolls to 6-year-olds with pink bows, went to theaters this past weekend to see the icon come to life. Many movie fans got into the spirit by dressing in all-pink outfits, including jewelry or a blond wig or making shirts to match.
El Pasoan Lupe Juarez said she grew up with Barbies, and seeing the movie was nostalgic. She wanted to take her goddaughter Saber Grace Flores, 6, to show her what she grew up with.
""It went from wanting to take her to the movie to really creating an experience for her. I had lots of good memories with Barbie. I had the van, and the swimming pool, the suitcase to carry them in and the dollhouse. So I wanted her to see it the way I saw it,"" she said.
Juarez said she couldn't help but have matching shirts for her and Saber to wear with the logo.
Here is what you need to know about the film.
Barbie movie run time
The ""Barbie"" runs for a confirmed 113 minutes and 54 seconds. That'sone hour and 54 minutes.
Why is the new Barbie movie rated PG-13?
The movie is rated PG-13 with some words that parents might find inappropriate for young children. It also has some suggestive references and adult humor. Barbie is played by Margot Robbie and Ken is played by Ryan Gosling.
The film is about stereotypical Barbie venturing into the ""real world"" to learn which hapless human has been causing her to malfunction. Along the way, she learns who made her, the trap of trying to be perfect and the tangled web of patriarchy and feminism, according to movie reviews.
Children will be captivated by the beautiful imagery of Barbie's world and should get the message of living their dreams and that it's OK to be different, Juarez said.

2023-07-23 14:40:58+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Opens to Record-Setting $155 Million, ‘Oppenheimer’ Shatters Expectations With $80 Million Debut","""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" shattered expectations, fueling the fourth-biggest box office weekend in history.","“Barbenheimer” is more than just a meme. It’s a full-fledged box office phenomenon.
Over the weekend, moviegoers turned out in force for Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated fantasy comedy “Barbie,” which smashed expectations with $155 million to land the biggest debut of the year. But they also showed up to see Christopher Nolan’s R-rated historical drama “Oppenheimer,” which collected a remarkable $80.5 million in its opening weekend.
Hundreds of thousands of ticket buyers refused to choose between the two seemingly different auter-driven blockbusters with sprawling casts and twin release dates. So they opted to attend same-day viewings of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” turning the box office battle into a double feature for the ages.
“This is an unequivocally great weekend for moviegoing,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ are complementing each other at the box office, not taking audience from each other.”
The cultural craze known as “Barbenheimer” worked to fuel the biggest collective box office weekend of the pandemic era, as well as the fourth-biggest overall weekend in history. It’s worth noting the top three weekends of all time were led by the debuts of sequels in massive franchises (“Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”).
“Studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, says Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry’s trade organization. “People recognized that something special was happening, and they wanted to be a part of it.”
In the end, though, it wasn’t a competition as “Barbie” loomed large over box office charts, thanks to an inescapable marketing campaign, as well as quality to match the stratospheric hype. At the international box office, the film added $182 million for a stunning global tally of $337 million.
The $145 million-budgeted movie, backed by Warner Bros. and Mattel, dominated the zeitgeist in the weeks leading up to its debut (even reportedly causing a shortage of the color pink) to a degree that’s rare for original fare. (Yes, Barbie is perhaps the world’s most famous doll, but the movie isn’t a sequel or part of a pre-existing film franchise.)
“We have a pink unicorn here,” says Jeff Goldstein, the president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “We thought it would be $75 million for the opening weekend. Nobody saw $155 million coming. This doll has long legs.”
Audiences and critics dug the PG-13 film, which landed an “A” CinemaScore and 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Initial crowds were 65% female (which, duh…), but that’s notable because it’s almost always the inverse for any movie that generates over $100 million in its debut.
Among its many records, “Barbie” also scored the biggest opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman. “Captain Marvel,” which was co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, previously held the title with $153 million in 2019. “Wonder Woman,” from filmmaker Patty Jenkins, stood as the record-holder for a movie solely directed by a woman with $103 million in 2017.
Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated director of “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” co-wrote the screenplay with her partner Noah Baumbach. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling star as the stereotypical versions of Barbie and Ken, who leave behind the Dreamhouse on a quest for self-discovery in the real world. The cast also includes Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell.
“Oppenheimer” may be settling for second place — not that Universal or Nolan is complaining. Buoyed by stellar reviews and premium large formats, the biopic about the so-called “father of the atomic bomb” is wildly outperforming expectations for a three-hour-long period piece with little action and lots of talking.
Heading into the weekend, analysts were anticipating a $50 million start, which already would have been notable given the grim film’s subject matter and style. With the bigger-than-projected debut, Nolan has only solidified his status as a box office draw, no matter the genre. And his appeal as a filmmaker spans continents. At the international box office, “Oppenheimer” added $93.7 million for a global tally of $174 million.
“This is a 1940s period piece,” says Universal’s president of domestic distribution Jim Orr. “That speaks volumes to the appeal of Nolan and his prowess as a filmmaker. He has an amazing reputation for storytelling in the biggest format possible.”
Nolan, the blockbuster director of “The Dark Knight” and “Inception,” is known to evangelize about Imax — and moviegoers have taken note. Premium large formats (PLFs, as they are known in the industry) contributed a massive 47% of the film’s domestic tally. Imax alone accounted for $35 million of global ticket sales.
“Around the world, we’ve seen sellouts at 4 a.m. shows and people traveling hours across borders to see ‘Oppenheimer’ in Imax 70mm,” says Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. “This is a phenomenon beyond compare in Imax, and we’re just getting started.”
Universal is backing the $100 million- budgeted “Oppenheimer,” which is notable because it marks the first time in more than two decades that Nolan isn’t working with Warner Bros. (Yes, the backers of “Barbie.”) He parted ways with the studio over its ill-fated decision to put its entire 2021 movie slate simultaneously on HBO Max.
Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” “Oppenheimer” is a star-studded character study about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the man who led the action at Los Alamos, alongside an ensemble of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Alden Ehrenreich.
With “Barbenheimer” taking up most of the oxygen at multiplexes, the other movies that were playing in theaters had to fight for scraps.
Tom Cruise’s big-budget sequel “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” took third place, tumbling by 64% with $19.5 million in its second weekend of release. It didn’t help that “Oppenheimer” is all but monopolizing the country’s PLF footprint, where tickets are pricier than standard screens.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s globe-trotting action franchise has generated $118.7 million in North America and $370 million globally to date. However, it cost a mammoth $291 million before marketing, so it’ll need to hold its own against “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” to justify that price tag.
In fourth place, the independent juggernaut “Sound of Freedom” added $18.8 million from 3,285 theaters in its fourth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $124 million to date, making it the 14th-highest grossing domestic release of the year.
Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” rounded out the top five, bringing in $6.7 million from 2,885 venues. After four weeks on the big screen, Harrison Ford’s action-adventure movie has grossed $159 million domestically and $335 million worldwide. The only trouble? It cost $300 million (and remember, theater owners get a share of ticket sales), meaning Indiana Jones is still deep in the red.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXNoYXR0ZXItcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1Njc3NjAxL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItb3BlbmluZy13ZWVrZW5kLXNoYXR0ZXItcmVjb3Jkcy0xMjM1Njc3NjAxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Barbie’ movie director Greta Gerwig tackles ‘sellout’ claims: ‘I’m making art to be seen by people’,"On claims she's a ""sellout,"" the director says she's ""making art to be seen by people.""","Barbie, the doll, may be 64 years old, but “Barbie,” the movie, is a pandemic baby.
Greta Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind “Little Women” and “Lady Bird,” started dreaming it up at a time when she wasn’t sure movies would ever come back.
“I wanted to channel something that had that ache in it, but also something so wild and unruly and something that was so just spilling out over the edges of it that you want to be in a group and see it big,” Gerwig told The Associated Press this week. “Because I thought we’ll never make any movies again, but if they’re going to, I’d like this.”
Her “Barbie,” which releases in theaters on Friday, is a joyful, maximalist, deeply weird, insightful and defiantly pink confection starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. She co-wrote it with her partner, Noah Baumbach, with whom she shares two sons — a toddler and a five-month-old whom they welcomed into the world while getting “Barbie” out to the world.
Gerwig spoke to the AP this week about the film, the reviews, the tension between art and commerce, and the unlikely connection between “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” (Hint: It’s not just the release date.)
Remarks have been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.AP: Reviews for “Barbie” came out (Wednesday) and are very positive. I’m wondering if you engage with those and how you’re feeling?
GERWIG: I do. I mean, of course. I’m not Emily Dickinson. I’m not above anything. I didn’t actually look last night because I just knew I would be too anxious. I was like go to sleep, wake up, caffeinate, get your kid to summer camp and then find out where we are. There’s a lot of reviewers that I really respect and have really liked. Film criticism matters to me as a person and also being in conversation with people who think about cinema matters. But it can feel very scary at the moment that you’re at the emotional pitch of releasing a movie to take it in.
What I tend to do is know which ones I’m going to go back to in a few weeks when I can take it in more. It’s too overwhelming at the moment. … All my metaphors go to giving birth because I have a five-month-old but it would be like if you just give birth and then you’re like, “What are the reviews of the baby?” But I did check the email and I’m pleased. (“Barbie”) seems to have been received in the spirit that it was meant, which is exciting.AP: I read that you called Peter Weir (“The Truman Show” director) to get advice on creating an artificial world with emotional authenticity. Is there anything he told you that you can share?
GERWIG: He was so generous getting on the phone with me. I had this idea of making Barbie Land basically an interior soundstage world. That was that was the concept. But as big as soundstages are, they’re not the world. They’re going to be small. You can only hang the lights so high.
There’s obviously parts of his movie that are done on a stage, but then there are other parts of it that can’t possibly be on a stage because it’s too big, but it feels like it’s on a stage, you know? Why does it feel like it’s on a stage? He explained to me they did shoot a lot of it outside in this community in Florida, but that they hung big stage lighting everywhere so it would look lit even though it was outside. And then he said it made everything like 120 degrees and that he did not suggest that. He was like I wouldn’t do that. It works but you might want to avoid making a place that’s hot, hotter.AP: That’s great that you asked.
GERWIG: In my experience, directors are so generous speaking about what they’ve done and how they did it and what were the problems, because you’re only ever on your own movie AND movies are hard and they always feel completely unlikely and completely impossible but in a new way that the other one wasn’t. Whatever lessons you learned on the last one, you can apply some of them, but it’s going to be a new set of issues. And other directors want to give you the knowledge that they’ve gotten that they can’t use anymore because they’ve already made that movie.
I had the same experience when I was making “Little Women.” Steven Spielberg was incredibly generous with me because he had made “Lincoln,” which took place in the same year. He opened up all of his research, all the lighting diagrams that he did with his cinematographer. He was like here’s how we did it. He just showed me absolutely everything. Even though you’re only ever in your own in your own dream of your own movie, there’s camaraderie in the loneliness.AP: I wondered going in if “Barbie” was going to be for kids, but then about 15 minutes in I realized that this is exactly the type of movie that I wish I’d had to obsess over at age 8 instead of, like “Grease 2.”
GERWIG: I’ve never thought of such a sharp delineation of like what’s for kids and for adults. I just don’t see it as church and state. There’s this Demetri Martin joke that’s like, saying you like kids is like saying, “I like people, for a little while.” We all have some sense of childhood and sense of moving out of it, too, which I think is something that I probably will be forever interested in. We’re not Merlin. We only live in one direction.AP: There’s talk of a Proust Barbie in the film, which doesn’t seem random. Could you elaborate on why you chose him?
GERWIG: In “Remembrance of Things Past,” in “Swann’s Way,” he is literally thrown back into his childhood through the taste of the madeleine. I thought, well, that’ll be a nice Easter egg for one person.AP: Proust was Oppenheimer’s favorite too. I did not expect that to be the connection between these movies.
GERWIG: So he would have loved Proust Barbie!AP: There’s a scene where Barbie enters the real world and is being ogled on Venice Beach and certainly it’s something a lot of women can relate to, but I wonder if that reminded you at all of your days starting out as an actor and feeling like you had to look a certain way.
GERWIG: I always felt like I was just was never quite right, that I was somehow being looked at and found lacking. That’s not exclusively available for actors, I think it’s pretty universal. But it’s heightened as an actor. I did an audition once and I was wearing overalls, I think it was for a TV show, and I got into the room and the casting director looked at me and said “Well you must be very talented.” I thought, “Oh no, maybe I’m not talented enough to just be wearing overalls.” Also that this is going quite badly.AP: There’s some thematic similarities between all your films — women’s economic independence, self-actualization and the idea that emotion is not a weakness.
GERWIG: With any project, I’m completely in it. I can’t really connect it to other things I’ve done. But then when I step back from it, I think, “Oh, these are connected in some way.” I think I’m just interested in the gleeful messiness of life and people. And I’m interested in women. I don’t know, I like them a lot. And I’m interested in women talking to each other through generations. The unwieldy nature of living life is not something that always has to be organized. It can kind of live in its own wildness.AP: There’s comfort in the idea that it can all be true.
GERWIG: The hope of stepping into everything, was allowing it to all be equally true. I think of the character of Sasha who dismantles Barbie. I wanted everything she said to be absolutely true. And also other things that are true at the same time. That’s always the place that feels most accurate to me.AP: There was a Guardian piece, I’m not sure if you’ve read it, about indie directors “selling out.” I feel like this is related, that “Barbie” can be a Mattel movie and also a piece of legitimate art and expression as well. And also, like your characters, you’re ensuring your economic independence while getting your ideas out to the biggest audience possible.
GERWIG: I haven’t read it. I’m sure they make good points, probably. There’s always some tension, obviously, between art that exists in the world to be seen and consumed. I joked at the beginning that I’m not Emily Dickinson, but I really am not Emily Dickinson. I’m not writing poems on the back of envelopes and creating and destroying worlds from the confines of my home and never letting anybody see it. I’m making art to be seen by people.
I am not comparing myself to this person at all, but one of the first things when I was a kid was (Sacramento’s) version of Shakespeare in the Park. I got to be part of it when I was 11. I had one line but I loved it, I would go backstage and just watch everyone. It was “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” which was created because the fans liked the character of Falstaff. That’s true. He was a fan favorite in “Henry IV” and, like, someone said could you write a play that’s like, a spinoff. And Shakespeare was like, you got it. And it’s amazing. And it’s also a spinoff of a character. I’m not saying I’m like Shakespeare, but I do think that sort of tension is part of what I like about all of it. We all live in this mess. Except for Emily Dickinson. But she’s the only one.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yMC9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtZGlyZWN0b3ItZ3JldGEtZ2Vyd2lnLXFhLXNlbGxvdXQtY2xhaW1zLW9zY2FyLW5vbWluYXRlZC_SAWhodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjAvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLWRpcmVjdG9yLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1xYS1zZWxsb3V0LWNsYWltcy1vc2Nhci1ub21pbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Is the 'Barbie' Movie Appropriate For Younger Kids?,'Barbie' has a PG-13 rating making some parents worried it's inappropriate for younger children. Here's one mom's take on why her 8-year-old daughter will be seeing the movie and everything you need to know to decide if it's right for your own family.,"The long-awaited Barbie movie is here. My social media feeds are filled with the vintage Barbie looks Margot Robbie has been nailing on the red carpet, love letters to Barbie from all generations, hilarious memes, and, most of all, raging debates among parents asking, ”Is ‘Barbie’ appropriate for kids?”
I know, it sounds a little counterintuitive considering that every little girl in America was patiently awaiting opening day. But if you haven't heard, the Motion Picture Association actually gave Barbie, Ken, and the gang a PG-13 rating!
It never once crossed my mind that perhaps Barbie might be inappropriate for my 8-year-old daughter. First of all, the movie is being marketed to girls well under 13. There’s an entire line of Barbie dolls and accessories in the toy aisle, not to mention Barbiecore clothes and accessories in the children’s section (PS: we own most of it).
It was never going to fly if I told my daughter she could have a “Margot Robbie” Barbie and a “Ryan Gosling” Ken doll but had to wait five years to see the movie. I’d love to think my daughter will want a Barbie-themed bat mitzvah but it’s rather unlikely.
Second of all, I really and truly don’t think my daughter and her friends will pay a bit of attention to the movie’s dialogue. They only care about watching their beloved dolls come alive as they soak in larger-than-life Dream Houses, Barbie’s over-the-top wardrobe, and a movie set that is SO pink, it caused a global shortage of pink paint.
It's not giving anything away because it's in the trailer, but one scene features a moment where Ken suggests sleeping over at Barbie’s house. Barbie innocently replies, “To do what?” My daughter laughed when she saw the trailer but never asked for more details. But if she did ask, I would’ve delicately explained those dynamics.
It’s inevitable that Barbie may bring up questions about romantic relationships, feminism, and even death (there’s a scene where Barbie brings a dance party to a screeching halt by asking, “Do you ever think about dying”?). I’m not worried. In fact, I’m happy to use the movie as a jumping-off point to answer questions, broach sensitive subjects and start a healthy dialogue.
Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures
I took my daughter to see Are You There God, It’s Me Margaret—another PG-13 movie sans the distraction of a glossy set and wardrobe. Based on the famed and beloved Judy Blume novel, the movie touched on puberty, religion, family issues, and more.
A few days after seeing Are You There God, It’s Me, Margaret in theaters, my daughter asked—while we were in a long line at Target—what it was like when I got my first period. Maybe it wasn’t quite the setting I was hoping to have such a chat with her, but we had a really beautiful and honest conversation that I believe my daughter was able to grasp because of the foundation laid out by the movie. So if anything beyond “Which Barbie is your favorite” is asked after we see the movie—I’m prepared!
With that said, taking a younger child to see Barbie is a personal decision. The movie received its PG-13 rating because of “suggestive references” and “brief language.” Some parents may not be ready or comfortable to discuss the more advanced plot lines while others may simply just know if their child is or is not ready to be introduced to mature topics.
It’s worth noting in the film, Barbieland features a diverse group of Barbies and Kens with a range of body sizes, disabilities, and racial and ethnic backgrounds. But, if you’re still unsure—here’s what you need to know so you can make an informed decision before buying tickets to Barbie for your family.
Sexual Innuendos
Barbie and Ken have been “couple goals” for decades. Raise your hand if you’ve been “witness” to hundreds of weddings for the celebrated couple in your playroom! But much of the innocence of their relationship likely has to do with one important detail—both Barbie and Ken are missing their private parts. It’s a fact that is acknowledged in the Barbie movie though they make reference to their missing genitalia in a humorous way. It’s not explicit or vulgar and there’s nothing that resembles nudity. At one point the words ""vagina"" and ""penis"" are used.
There is also that reference mentioned earlier when Ken asks Barbie to stay the night, but he doesn't know what that really means. Ken does try to kiss Barbie more than once. There are also some pick-up lines, cat-calling, and other double entendres that you may get that your kids may not. Oh, and the Kens do have plenty of scenes when they are shirtless.
Mature Language and Themes
It should be noted that Barbie is directed by Greta Gerwig whose body of work includes directing movies with strong leading ladies and coming-of-age themes such as Ladybird and Little Women. So Gerwig’s take on Barbie focuses on gender roles and equality, what it means to be a woman, finding happiness, and fulfillment, and even touches on death as Barbie has a bit of an existential crisis.
Yes, there is some “strong” language used but the one word that would really require some “earmuffs” is actually bleeped out. There is no other profanity. There is some beer-drinking in some scenes as well.
While these topics are broached with sensitivity, care, and humor, they are definitely geared toward the older audiences (hello Gen X) watching for the nostalgia of it all.
Mild Violence
And by mild violence, we mean barely any that is a real cause for concern. There’s a battle among the Kens that is “cartoony” at best— most kids have likely seen worse in Disney movies. Their weapons include inflatable pool toys and they get the most aggressive in a dance-off. There is also a car chase scene, but again, nothing that's a real cause for concern.
If you're still unsure or do take your younger child but want to be prepared with conversation starters after seeing Barbie, Common Sense Media has some great ideas to get you started. The organization is known for its reviews and ratings of TV shows and movies based on children's age and appropriateness. In the review of Barbie, the group includes talking points that you can bring up with your child.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmVudHMuY29tL2lzLXRoZS1iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtYXBwcm9wcmlhdGUtZm9yLXlvdW5nLWtpZHMtNzU2MzIxNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,What ‘Barbie’ Says About the Gender Wars,"In the movie, the Kens are fine letting Barbies run everything. In the real world, it’s more complicated.","But Barbie’s path to self-awareness isn’t especially surprising or subversive. It’s the Kens who have the real arc of discovery. Barbie started as a 1950s concept, at a time when women’s and men’s spheres were mostly separate and well-defined; it made sense that play-acting a woman’s life might involve dressing up and puttering around the Dreamhouse, while Ken, hard at work, would pop in from time to time to change his outfit. But as Barbie expanded her horizons, Ken had to change, too. And as Barbie gained in competence and confidence, the movie suggests, Ken somehow got less of both — a feared outcome that is shaping politics in the very real, non-Mattel, post-women’s liberation world.
The movie’s Barbie Land is a bizarro world of girl power fantasy, taken to the extreme. While the Barbies hold society’s important roles — yes, there is an all-Barbie Supreme Court — the Kens spend all day tanned, buff and rudderless beside the plastic surf. Ryan Gosling’s Ken explains, early on, that his job is “beach.” It’s a script-flipping take on 1950s gender standards, to a point — the Kens don’t have to do housework or anything — and it’s partly a consequence of the toys themselves. Margot Robbie’s movie Barbie treats Gosling’s movie Ken the way a five-year-old girl today might treat her Ken doll: an accessory to the main toy, available for fashion shows and occasional, chaste companionship. (The movie has a lot of fun with the idea that the dolls have no genitalia.)

But when Barbie and Ken travel to the Real World — it’s best not to think too much about the logic of the plot; let’s just say there are roller blades and magic — Ken discovers something called the patriarchy. This sets him on a journey of self-aggrandizement and entitlement. First, he assumes that he’s qualified for any job because, you know, he’s a man. Then he returns to Barbie Land, which he renames “Kendom,” and leads his fellow Kens into a glorious exploration of every caricature of machismo: horses, chain necklaces, high-testosterone beach battles, the singing of melancholy ’90s grunge ballads beside plastic campfires. “I’ll play the guitar at you!” one Ken says to his Barbie counterpart. The most delightful moment in the movie is a musical fantasia in which the newly-power-hungry Kens, dressed in black, dance in exuberant formation. The smile on Gosling’s face looks genuine, like he’s been caught on a take where he’s broken the fourth wall and is fully enjoying the joke.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjMvMDcvMjEvYmFyYmllLWhhcy1zb21ldGhpbmctdG8tc2F5LWFib3V0LXRoZS1wb3N0LXBhdHJpYXJjaHktMDAxMDczMTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"""Barbie"" global ticket sales reach $1 billion in historic first for women directors",Greta Gerwig is now the first woman in Hollywood history to hold the sole directing credit on a billion-dollar film.,"In the three weeks since its debut in theaters, ""Barbie"" has surpassed $1 billion in global ticket sales, marking a historic moment for the film industry as it becomes the first movie directed solely by a woman to hit this box office milestone.
Greta Gerwig, who directed ""Barbie,"" joins a small group of people who have the sole directing credit on a billion-dollar movie in Hollywood's history. She now holds the box office record for women directors, which Patty Jenkins last set with ""Wonder Woman"" in 2017. That film raked in more than $800 million.
""Barbie"" has earned about $1.03 billion worldwide as of Sunday, according to Box Office Mojo. The feminist film, which Gerwig directed and co-wrote after previously receiving Oscar nominations for her earlier films ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women,"" already broke one major record. It had the biggest opening weekend for a women director ever, according to Fandango managing editor Erik Davis.
""Barbie"" added another $53 million from 4,178 North American locations this weekend according to studio estimates on Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place for three weeks and it's hardly finished yet.

In modern box office history, just 53 movies have made over $1 billion, not accounting for inflation, and ""Barbie"" is now the biggest to be directed by one woman, supplanting ""Wonder Woman's"" $821.8 million global total. Three movies that were co-directed by women are still ahead of ""Barbie,"" including ""Frozen"" ($1.3 billion) and ""Frozen 2"" ($1.45 billion) both co-directed by Jennifer Lee and ""Captain Marvel"" ($1.1 billion), co-directed by Anna Boden. But, ""Barbie"" has passed ""Captain Marvel"" domestically with $459.4 million (versus $426.8 million), thereby claiming the North American record for live-action movies directed by women.
New competition came this weekend in the form of the animated, PG-rated ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" and the Jason Statham shark sequel, ""Meg 2: The Trench,"" both of which were neck-in-neck with Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer,"" also in its third weekend, for the second-place spot.
""Meg 2"" managed to sneak ahead and land in second place. It overcame its abysmal reviews to score a $30 million opening weekend from 3,503 locations. The Warner Bros. release, directed by Ben Wheatley, currently has a 29% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and a B- CinemaScore from audiences. The thriller was released in 3D, which accounted for 22% of its first weekend business.
Third place went to ""Oppenheimer,"" which added $28.7 million from 3,612 locations in North America, bringing its domestic total to $228.6 million. In just three weeks, the J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic starring Cillian Murphy has become the highest grossing R-rated film of the year (ahead of ""John Wick Chapter 4"") and the sixth-biggest of the year overall, surpassing ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.""
""Oppenheimer"" also celebrated a landmark, crossing $500 million globally in three weeks. Its worldwide tally is currently $552.9 million, which puts it ahead of ""Dunkirk,"" which clocked out with $527 million in 2017, and has become Nolan's fifth-biggest movie ever. It's also now among the four top grossing biographies ever (company includes ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""American Sniper"") and the biggest World War II movie of all time.
Paramount's ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was close behind in fourth place with an estimated $28 million from 3,858 theaters in North America. Since opening on Wednesday, the film, which is riding on excellent reviews (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores, has earned $43.1 million.
""This is one of those movies that is a multigenerational joy,"" said Chris Aronson, Paramount's president of domestic distribution. ""I think the enduring popularity of 'Turtles' is showing its true colors. And there hasn't been an animated film in eight weeks and there won't be another for eight weeks which is great for us.""
""Turtles"" cost $70 million to produce and features a starry voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Ayo Edebiri and Seth Rogen, who produced and co-wrote the film, which leans into the ""teenage"" aspect of the turtles.
""Barbie,"" ""Oppenheimer"" and even the surprise, anti-trafficking hit ""Sound of Freedom"" (now at $163.5 million and ahead of ""Mission: Impossible 7"") have helped fuel a boom at the box office, bringing in many millions more than was expected and helping to offset pains caused by some summer disappointments.
""After 'The Flash,' 'Indiana Jones' and, to a certain extent, 'Mission: Impossible,' people were saying the summer was a disappointment. But it's not over yet,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. ""We're going to have a summer that is going to go out on a high note.""
But the moment of triumph for the industry will likely be short lived if the studios can't reach an agreement with striking actors and writers soon. The fall release calendar has already gotten slimmer, with some studios pushing films into 2024 instead of trying to promote them without movie stars.
Sony had planned to release its PlayStation-inspired true story ""Gran Turismo"" in theaters nationwide next Friday, but will now be rolling it out slowly for two weeks before going wide on Aug. 25. The thinking? If movie stars can't promote the film, maybe audiences can.
""We have to be realistic,"" Dergarabedian said. ""We're on this emotional high of movies doing so well, but we have to temper our enthusiasm and optimism with the fact that the strike is creating a lot of uncertainty. The longer it goes on the more profound the issues become. But the audience has spoken and they love going to the movie theater.""
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

2. ""Meg 2: The Trench,"" $30 million.

2023-07-08 10:50:34-05:00,No Barbie Girl in Vietnam's World,Hotly anticipated summer movie banned from Vietnam over map showing disputed territory,"Two very different films are set to come out on July 21. One is about the development of the world’s first nuclear weapons. The other is about Barbie.
Which one has proved to be contentious on the global stage? Surprisingly, it's not the Oppenheimer biopic.
Instead, the much-anticipated “Barbie” has stoked controversy in both Vietnam and the Philippines this week, with the former banning it outright and the latter considering a similar move.
Over the years, Barbie manufacturer Mattel has come under fire for producing dolls that aren’t diverse and that some have said promote unrealistic body standards.
But now the brand has inadvertently strayed into geopolitical quarrels with the movie’s inclusion of Beijing’s controversial nine-dash line on a map.
Vietnamese officials this week banned screenings of the film because it shows a map with the disputed Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. Manila is considering following suit.
The nine-dash line depicts Beijing’s contested claims to parts of the South China Sea. Vietnam, as well as Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan all dispute the line.
An international tribunal at the Hague ruled in 2016 that the nine-dash line was invalid, but Beijing has not recognized the decision.
Free expression experts say such bans won’t solve the territorial dispute and may help strengthen domestic censorship systems in the process. To others, the entire situation is being blown out of proportion.
For years, questions have been raised over the extent to which American studios acquiesce to Beijing. And for Hollywood, the Chinese market, standing at 1.4 billion people, is lucrative.
Vietnam and the Philippines have previously banned movies for including the nine-dash line, including Sony’s 2022 movie Uncharted, DreamWorks’ 2019 movie Abominable. Vietnam also banned the 2018 Australian TV series Pine Gap, and the Philippines censored select episodes.
Hanoi’s “Barbie” ban shows that “censors have started to be more sensitive about information on territorial disputes between Vietnam and China,” said Trinh Huu Long, the founder of the journalism and research group Legal Initiatives for Vietnam.
“The censors will even be praised for overreacting to the unclear map, by both their superiors and the public, because anti-China sentiment runs deep into the country’s political culture,” added Long, who grew up in Vietnam but now lives in Taiwan.
Still, some China experts think the Barbie movie’s alleged inclusion of the nine-dash line is not a pressing concern for either country.
“I don’t expect this to be more than a really incidental sort of thing,” said Rui Zhong, a China expert at the Wilson Center. “I don’t think either foreign ministry is losing sleep over the Barbie movie.
“The map has some waves drawn in the ocean and a sun over Africa, so I don’t really know the larger-scale geographical accuracy or implications,” Zhong told VOA. “I seriously doubt this is a film that will extensively wade into East or Southeast Asian politics.”
China has so far been ignoring international law and building man-made islands in the South China Sea to help buttress its disputed sovereignty claims.
But outright bans on films that may legitimize those claims still aren’t the best solution, according to Michael Caster, who covers Asia at the free expression group Article 19.
“Maps are political, and borders often bear historical wounds, but rather than ensuring free and open discussion, the knee jerk response to censor seldom supports historical or transitional justice,” Caster told VOA.
The film studio Warner Bros., for its part, has defended the Barbie movie’s map, which depicts eight dashes.
“The map in Barbie Land is a whimsical, child-like crayon drawing,” Warner Bros. said Friday. “The doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the real world. It was not intended to make any type of statement.”
For Long, the concern over Vietnam’s “Barbie” ban is that these sorts of prohibitions — related more to sovereignty and less to political dissent — ultimately make it easier for Hanoi to ban materials that actually might be critical of the government.
“The government is surely using legitimate nationalist reasoning to strengthen its entire censorship system,” Long said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evbm8tYmFyYmllLWdpcmwtaW4tdmlldG5hbS1zLXdvcmxkLS83MTcxOTcxLmh0bWzSAUtodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbm8tYmFyYmllLWdpcmwtaW4tdmlldG5hbS1zLXdvcmxkLS83MTcxOTcxLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Everything to know about the Barbie movie cast,"Featuring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and many more, here are all the famous faces in Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie' movie.","As we bide our time until opening night, EW has compiled everything you need to know about the cast of Barbie.
Something must have changed along the way because nearly everyone involved with the production of Barbie seems to agree that Gerwig's interpretation of the iconic character is both feminist and funny.
Though Amy Schumer was originally attached to develop Mattel's signature feature, the comedian left the project when it was clear that executives at Mattel didn't see eye-to-eye with her feminist vision. ""They definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,"" she told Andy Cohen on an episode of Watch What Happens Live.
It's quite possibly the most anticipated film of the year so far. Greta Gerwig 's Barbie , starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, finally arrives in theaters on July 21, 2023, after spending the better part of a decade in development. Gerwig's involvement was first announced in 2019, marking the 60th anniversary of Barbie herself.
01 of 24 Margot Robbie (Barbie) Han Myung-Gu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Margot Robbie began acting in her native Australia on the soap Neighbors and rose to international fame with her barnstorming turn in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), followed by playing Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), James Gunn's superior sequel The Suicide Squad (2021), and Cathy Yan's invigorating Birds of Prey (2020). She soon earned two Oscar nominations for her brilliant turn as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya (2017) and her role in Bombshell (2019) before turning heads as Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In 2022, Robbie starred in an absolute mess called Amsterdam, as well as the similarly maximalist Babylon. More recently, she played a small but pivotal role in Wes Anderson's delightful, thoughtfully constructed Asteroid City (2023). Robbie has been married to producer Tom Ackerley since 2016. The couple met on the set of the 2014 film Suite Française, and founded LuckyChap Entertainment together the following year. Along with Barbie, the company has produced her costar Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman and I, Tonya, as well as the Netflix series Maid (2021) and upcoming spins on Ocean's 11 and Tank Girl. (Rejoice!) As for why she signed on to play Barbie, Robbie cited the casting as part of her motivation. ""I don't think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film if there wasn't a wide diversity of Barbies and Kens,"" she told Time. ""I don't think you should say, 'This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that's what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.'""
02 of 24 Ryan Gosling (Ken) Mathew Tsang/Getty, Warner Brothers Former Mouseketeer Ryan Gosling got his first acting credit on a 1995 episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark? Since then, the actor has carved a spacious nook for himself on the top shelf of Hollywood. His most notable works include the classic weepy The Notebook (2004), his Oscar-nominated turn in Half Nelson (2006), Lars and the Real Girl (2007), Blue Valentine, the neo-noir action-thriller Drive, George Clooney's Ides of March, and the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love. Gosling generated further buzz by headlining Adam McKay's The Big Short (2015) and the refreshing comedy The Nice Guys (2016) before earning another Oscar nom for singing and dancing his way through La La Land with Emma Stone and cruising through Blade Runner 2049 in 2017. He then took a four-year break to spend more time with his wife, Eva Mendes (whom he met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011), and their two daughters. The actor currently has four projects in development, including the update of The Fall Guy and Margot Robbie's purported Ocean's 11 prequel. Playing Ken has given Gosling a new respect for the character, who the actor has found himself defending as of late. ""It is funny, this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken,"" he told GQ in May 2023. ""Like you ever thought about Ken before this?… No, you didn't. You never did. You never cared."" Gosling continued: ""If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told.""
03 of 24 Michael Cera (Allan) Jon Kopaloff/Getty, Warner Brothers Michael Cera grew up in Canada and made a name for himself as George-Michael Bluth, Jason Bateman's awkward teenage son, on Arrested Development (2003–2018). He went on to appear in 2007's Superbad and Juno, Nick and Nora' Infinite Playlist (2008), Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and as ""himself"" in This Is the End (2013). He has since appeared on Broadway in the Kenneth Lonergan plays Lobby Hero (2018), for which he received a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actor, and The Waverly Gallery (2018). Cera is also a musician, having contributed to the soundtracks of both Scott Pilgrim and Nick and Nora, as well as mandolin and backing vocals to the Weezer track ""Hang On."" His song ""Best I Can,"" featuring Sharon Van Etten, was nominated for a 2017 Critics' Choice Award for Best Song Featured in a Documentary, though his 2014 cover of ""Clay Pigeons"" by Blaze Foley remains his most popular musical work to date. In 2022, Cera revealed that he is a father to a young son with his wife, Nadine.
04 of 24 Will Ferrell (Mattel CEO) Dominik Bindl/WireImage, Warner Brothers After a tenure on some of the most fruitful seasons of Saturday Night Live, Will Ferrell segued into a successful acting and producing career in television and film. Along with Adam McKay, Ferrell created some of the most enduring comedies of the 21st century: Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys. Another noteworthy Ferrell flick is Blades of Glory (2006), where he and Jon Heder star as disgraced figure skaters. Ferrell has also been successful in more dramatic roles, namely in films Everything Must Go (2010) and Downhill (2020). Through his and McKay's Gary and Gloria Sanchez Productions, Ferrell has produced Eastbound and Down, Booksmart (2019), Hustlers (2019), Dead to Me, Succession, and The Menu (2022). Ferrell has been married to Viveca Paulin, with whom he has three children, since 2000. As for his role as the CEO of Mattel, the company behind the real-life Barbie doll, Ferrell has been singing his praises for the anticipated blockbuster. ""It is, in my humble opinion, the ultimate example of high art and low art,"" Ferrell told WSJ. Magazine. ""It's a loving homage to the brand and, at the same time, couldn't be more satirical — just an amazing comment on male patriarchy and women in society and why Barbie's criticized and yet why every little girl still wants to play with Barbie. Boy, when I read it, I was like, 'This is fantastic.'""
05 of 24 Helen Mirren (Narrator) Daniele Venturelli/Getty, Warner Brothers One of the most celebrated and decorated actors of all time, Helen Mirren boasts a staggering amount of credits to her name. She rose to acclaim in The Long Good Friday (1980) and Excalibur (1981). Mirren then won an Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen (2006), and has taken on action-hero roles in Red (2010) and its 2013 sequel, along with 2023's Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Other notable credits include films Gosford Park (2001) and Hitchcock (2012). Mirren will soon appear in the biopic Golda, in which she plays former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. Mirren has known Gerwig since they starred together in the entirely forgotten 2011 remake of Arthur, so the veteran actor jumped at the opportunity to be a part of Barbie. ""We formed a bond together, Mirren told Vanity Fair. ""She's an amazing visionary and an extraordinary talent."" Though she voices the narrator, whether or not she'll appear on screen in the finished film is still a mystery. ""I did shoot an appearance, but whether that's gotten to stay in the movie, I don't know."" Mirren has been married to director Taylor Hackford (Ray) since 1997.
06 of 24 Kate McKinnon (Weird Barbie) CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty, Warner Brothers Former Saturday Night Live MVP Kate McKinnon has stolen scenes in the films Masterminds (2016), Paul Feig's Ghostbusters (2016), Rough Night (2017), and The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018). In 2019, she starred in Danny Boyle's Yesterday and opposite Margot Robbie in Bombshell. As for television, McKinnon won two Emmys for SNL, has done voicework for Family Guy and The Simpsons, and starred in the underwhelming miniseries Joe vs. Carole, based on the infamous feud in Netflix's Tiger King. She's currently filming Andrew Stanton's sci-fi flick In the Blink of an Eye. When speaking to Fandango about her thoughts after reading the Barbie script, McKinnon shared her appreciation for the fact that it explores how ""gender roles deny people half their humanity,"" adding that it's a ""very powerful message.""
07 of 24 Issa Rae (President Barbie) James Gourley/Getty, Warner Brothers Issa Rae first became known through her 2011 web series Awkward Black Girl. In 2016, HBO began airing Ray's debut television show Insecure, which garnered critical acclaim and 14 Emmy nominations (plus a win for editing) across its five seasons. During that time, she also started in the 2019 film Little alongside Regina Hall. Rae appeared opposite Kumail Nanjiani in the chaotic rom-com The Lovebirds (2020), and had a small role in B.J. Novak's exceptional thriller Vengeance (2022). In 2023, Rae voiced Spider-Woman in the massive hit Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Rae voiced her belief that Gerwig's approach to her cast and crew led to the overall harmony on set. ""She collaborates with people whose opinions she values, and she wants to make sure that she's hearing everyone out,"" Rae said. ""She's so great about funneling those thoughts through her own vision and heightening and elevating them…Everyone had versions of how they wanted their Barbies or Kens to be, and I saw her take those ideas and make them her own in the best possible way.""
08 of 24 America Ferrera (Gloria) Han Myung-Gu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Superstore and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera plays a real-world character in Barbie who befriends the dolls when they arrive from Barbie Land. Ferrera's first film appearance was in Real Women Have Curves (2002), and she quickly netted more starring roles in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and its 2008 sequel, along with Lords of Dogtown (2005), a voice role in the How to Train Your Dragon films, and an unrecognizable turn in End of Watch (2012). Ferrera revealed on an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show that she decided to wear a particularly fashionable outfit to the Barbie cast sleepover at the swanky Claridge's Hotel in London. ""Nobody told me that it was sexy Barbie sleepover,"" Ferrera protested. ""So everybody was in like, really pretty silky nightgowns and I was in the most grandma floral twin set you could imagine.""
09 of 24 Simu Liu (Ken) Kevin Mazur/Getty, Warner Brothers Canadian native Simu Liu had roles on shows such as Pacific Rim (2012), Orphan Black (2013–2017), Blood and Water (2015), Kim's Convenience (2016–2021), Taken (2017), and Slasher (2016–present) before he joined the MCU as the titular hero in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). That same year, he hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live. Liu joined his other Barbie cast members in praising their director while speaking to Vanity Fair in 2022. ""I remember very clearly about some of our big intricate dance sequences. Greta was very, very conscientious about who she cast,"" he said. ""We were able to cast people of different shapes, sizes, differently abled, to all participate in this dance — all under this message of: 'You don't have to be blonde, white, or X, Y, Z in order to embody what it means to be a Barbie or a Ken.'""
10 of 24 Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken) PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty, Warner Brothers British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir got his start on the London stage before transitioning into television and film. He starred opposite Zoë Kravitz in Hulu's High Fidelity series adaptation and as Malcolm X in Regina King's One Night in Miami… (2020). Currently, Ben-Adir can be seen with Samuel L. Jackson in Marvel's Disney+ series Secret Invasion. Other noteworthy credits include Peaky Blinders, The OA, and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Ben-Adir told Variety he had no second thoughts about joining the production. ""From the first page, I was like, 'Wow, this is really, really funny!'... Then me and Greta went out for some whiskey. We spoke for two or three hours. There was a really strong sense from early on like she was trying to do something a little bit different,"" he said. ""It's very rare that a script like that comes along. So I was like, 'Whatever, whoever is in it, I just want to be on set with those guys and I want to be a part of it.'""
11 of 24 Ritu Arya (Journalist Barbie) Roy Rochlin/Getty, Warner Brothers Ritu Arya started acting through guest spots on British series such as Sherlock and Doctor Who before she landed a part in Paul Feig's Last Christmas (2019). That same year, she joined The Umbrella Academy in a lead role as Lila Pitts.

Like many other cast members, Shipp has praised Gerwig for encouraging each actor not to over-train for their role. ""Greta was really excited about everybody looking the way that Barbies should look, which is every shape and size,"" Shipp told Interview. ""I saw some of the film last week and it's really beautiful to see us all together looking like a gaggle of girls, but also a gaggle of dolls.""

""Oh my God, I'd be so, so happy,"" Coughlan told PEOPLE when asked how her teenage self would view her success today. She elaborated that her career is ""what I've always wanted — and I think something about it happening to me not in my 20s, it makes me look at it with a different lens, and I appreciate it so much.""
14 of 24 Emerald Fennell (Midge) Dave Benett/Getty, Warner Brothers Actress, writer, and director Emerald Fennell is set to appear in Barbie as a non-Barbiefied character named Midge.

She also starred on the TV series My Mad Fat Diary and Finding Alice (2021). Rooney told Scottish outlet Daily Record about her positive takeaways from the Barbie set. ""I think what Barbie's taught me is that you can do anything and be everything because she's a woman who — literally — does everything,"" she said. ""I'd really love to write something of my own. I see how clever Greta is and how wonderful she is and such an amazing actress, but she also is a phenomenal director. And Margot as well, she's an outrageously brilliant actress, but she's also got a fantastic production company.""
16 of 24 Dua Lipa (Mermaid Barbie) Cindy Ord/MG23/Getty, Warner Brothers London-born pop star Dua Lipa jump-started her career by posting covers of popular songs on YouTube. She released her first single, ""New Love,"" in 2015. Two years later, the artist issued her self-titled debut album, featuring hits ""New Rules"" and ""Be the One."" Her second studio album, Future Nostalgia, represented a jump forward in her work with its airy, disco-dotted sound. She's since won three Grammys, including Best New Artist in 2019. Lipa has recorded new music for Barbie — along with Charli XCX, Haim, Ice Spice, Lizzo, Tame Impala, and even Ryan Gosling — and is currently working on her next solo studio album. Barbie is her first acting role, though she has a part in Matthew Vaughn's film Argylle coming in 2024.
17 of 24 Hari Nef (Doctor Barbie) Pierre Suu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Hari Nef starred in the biographical drama Mapplethorpe and Sam Levinson's Assassination Nation in 2018, along with the comedies 1Up and Meet Cute. She's also appeared in episodes of Transparent, the controversial Max series The Idol, and the Sex and the City revival And Just Like That…"" Nef landed her role in Barbie after posting an open letter to Gerwig and Robbie on social media expressing her ambivalence for the term ""doll"" as a transgender woman. ""Identity politics and cinema aren't my favorite combination, but the name BARBIE looms large over every American woman,"" Nef wrote. ""Barbie's the standard; she's The Girl; she's certainly THE doll. 'Doll' is fraught, glamorous; she is, and she isn't. We call ourselves 'the dolls' in the face of everything we know we are, never will be, hope to be. We yell the word because the word matters. And no doll matters more than Barbie.""
18 of 24 Emma Mackey (Physicist Barbie) Antoine Flament/Getty, Warner Brothers Despite her roles in high-profile movies such as Death on the Nile (2022), the Gothic drama Emily (2023), and the dramedy series Sex Education, Emma Mackey marks being on the set of Barbie the highlight of her career thus far. ""It was the most fun I've ever had in my life. It was wonderful. It's being helmed by people who know what they're doing and who care and who are in the best possible circumstances to do their job,"" Mackey told Total Film. ""When they're in their element, and you see other people confident and calm in what they're doing, then you feel competent and calm, and you want to make them proud and you want to do the best job possible. It's all a very healthy work environment to be in. Those opportunities don't come by all the time so you've got to take them when you can.""
19 of 24 Ncuti Gatwa (Ken) Taylor Hill/WireImage, Warner Brothers Mackey's Sex Education costar Ncuti Gatwa — who currently serves as the Fifteenth Doctor on the long-running sci-fi darling Doctor Who — was cast in Barbie after Mackey, though he told Elle she kept his casting a secret until he had secured the role. ""...She knew I was going to be in the film because my name was in the script already,"" Gatwa said. ""She kept it a secret for a month! When I found out I got the part I called her singing the Aqua 'Barbie' song."" As for reuniting with Mackey, Gatwa felt it to be a blessing. ""We had just had such an intense five years together where we all became so close. We love each other so much and it's incredibly exciting seeing everyone go off and do their own things, but to be able to come back together? That's a magical experience.""
20 of 24 Ana Cruz Kayne (Supreme Court Justice Barbie) Gabriele Holtermann/UPI/Shutterstock, Warner Brothers Ana Cruz Kayne has an impressive list of credits to her name, including the inventive sci-fi film Another Earth (2011), the CBS crime drama series Bull, Louis C.K.'s sitcom Louie, the Tom Selleck drama Blue Bloods, and the upcoming Netflix series Painkiller. She also appeared in Gerwig's brilliant adaptation of Little Women (2019). Kayne took particular pleasure in bringing visibility to the Barbie universe. ""It was just so powerful to get to sit there as a woman of color, as the head of the Supreme Court,"" Kayne told The Messenger. ""It was everything you'd hope for. And because it's Barbie, it's power with a wink. So it felt very fitting.""
21 of 24 John Cena (Merman Ken) Michael Tran/FilmMagic Former professional wrestler John Cena is tied with Ric Flair for the most world championship reigns within the WWE. In the last 10 years, Cena has also become an ever-present actor, proving his comedy chops in Judd Apatow's Trainwreck (2015) and the raunchy comedy Blockers (2018) while also playing a villain in Bumblebee (2018). Cena later joined both The Suicide Squad (a role which he reprised in Max's Peacemaker series) and the Toretto family in F9: The Fast Hour (2021) and Fast X (2023). He also hosts the game show Wipeout alongside Nicole Byer. Cena has been married to Shay Shariatzadeh since October 2020. Cena revealed on the Today show that he actually pitched himself for the role ""in an accidental run-in with Margot Robbie."" Reportedly, Cena told Robbie that he ""will do, pretty much, whatever you guys need 'cause I really enjoy the movie. And they asked me if I wanted to be a merman.""

Wilson/Getty, Warner Brothers Yet another star of Sex Education, Connor Swindells has also appeared in the miniseries Vigil (2021) and SAS: Rogue Heroes (2022-present). His film appearances include The Vanishing (2019) opposite Gerard Butler and the Jane Austen adaptation Emma (2020).
23 of 24 Scott Evans (Ken) Kevin Winter/Getty, Warner Brothers Scott Evans has appeared in an enviable list of features, including The Lovely Bones (2009), Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009), and Almost Love (2020), and the TV series Grace and Frankie and White Collar. Having not appeared in any summer blockbusters up until this point, Evans couldn't believe the opportunity when he was cast in Barbie. ""I would say 'lost it' is a very big understatement!"" Scott told ET Online. ""When I found out that I got it, it was kind of just like a moment of processing and then it was a moment of, 'I have to go, I have people to call!' Oh my God, the first day of shooting, I was looking around the room. I'm like, 'OK, I know every single person in this room. Do I belong?'""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL21vdmllcy9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtY2FzdC1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-27 11:00:51+00:00,Inside the Barbie Movie: How the Massive Movie Came to Be,"Interviews with Mattel execs, Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie about how they tried to find art in commerce to create summer's biggest movie.","There’s plenty to consider about Barbie, but let’s start with her feet. Perfectly arched, but not quite demi-pointe—the ideal position to fit into any pump. They’re instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever played with the iconic doll. So when the trailer for the upcoming live-action Barbie movie opened with a shot of star Margot Robbie stepping out of Barbie’s marabou stilettos, still on tiptoes, the internet exploded. On TikTok, people attempted to mimic the viral shot with their highest heels. The Wall Street Journal interviewed a podiatrist about the physical impossibility of the moment. “I need to know everything,” tweeted Chrissy Teigen.
Robbie has answers: The shot took eight takes. She had to hold onto a bar to keep her feet flexed. And, yes, those are her feet. “I really don’t like it when someone else does my hands or feet in an insert shot,” she says.
Playing Barbie is complicated, and not just because it requires immense calf strength. I’ve reported on Barbie’s parent company Mattel for the better part of a decade and sat in on test groups with moms and their kids. Some parents say Barbie inspires their children to imagine themselves as astronauts and politicians. But others refuse to buy the doll—with her tiny waist and large breasts— because she has set an impossible beauty standard for their daughters, a problem that precipitated major changes to the doll’s look in 2016. A Barbie movie was always going to be fraught, and the studio marketing the film knows it. As the trailer posits, “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.”

Robbie adds, “If you feel indifferent about Barbie or haven’t thought about Barbie in years, this movie is also for you.”

When it was announced in 2021 that Greta Gerwig, who directed the Oscar-nominated coming-of-age stories Lady Bird and Little Women, would helm Barbie, fans were confused, surprised, and delighted. Maybe the movie would be an idiosyncratic, subversive, even feminist take on the doll, not just a commercial for Mattel. But like Barbie, the movie’s existence is an exercise in contradictions.
If you are wondering whether Barbie is a satire of a toy company’s capitalist ambitions, a searing indictment of the current fraught state of gender relations, a heartwarming if occasionally clichéd tribute to girl power, or a musical spectacle filled with earworms from Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa, the answer is yes. All of the above. And then some.
It’s also the most anticipated movie of the summer—if not the year—which means a lot is riding on Barbie. Not just for Robbie and Gerwig, neither of whom has ever produced a movie on this scale, but also for Mattel. After a period of declining sales, a recently reinvigorated Barbie is ready for her big-screen debut. Barbie’s move to Hollywood is the brainchild of Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, who came into the job five years ago with a vision to leverage the company’s intellectual property into a cinematic universe based on Mattel toys.
More from TIME
Barbie will be the proof of concept when it hits theaters on July 21, but first it has to go up against Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible) and Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer) in the busiest summer movie season in years. If projections of a $55 million opening weekend prove out, it will be thanks to Barbie mania. Anything associated with the film—a rare blockbuster catering directly to women—has been breathlessly received, from paparazzi photos of Robbie and co-star Ryan Gosling (as Ken) skating down Venice Beach in fluorescent spandex last summer to a teaser that cleverly parodies 2001: A Space Odyssey. Mattel has engineered some of the hype by launching Malibu Barbie cafés and announcing partnerships with Bloomingdale’s, Crocs, and Hot Topic. Other moments suggest a snowball effect: Kim Kardashian recently threw her daughter a Barbie-themed birthday party, and celebs are stepping out in hot pink designer minidresses. (Though, as a Mattel executive reminds me, Barbiecore “didn’t just happen.”)
Whatever audiences ultimately think of Barbie, Gerwig still can’t seem to believe she got away with making this version. “This movie is a goddamn miracle,” she says. She calls it a “surprising spicy margarita.” By the time you realize the salted rim has cayenne mixed in, it’s too late. “You can already taste the sweetness and you sort of go with the spice.”
How did a filmmaker who is best known for thoughtful movies about women’s inner lives come to write and direct a movie about a toy who has no inner life, and is (mostly) defined by her looks? It’s simple: Gerwig loves dolls.
“I played with dolls too long,” says the 39-year-old director. “I was still doing it in junior high. Kids were drinking, and I was playing with dolls.” Gerwig’s mom wasn’t a fan of Barbie for feminist reasons: “She went through the ’60s and was like, ‘What did we do all this for?’” But playing with Barbies proved to be a training ground for Gerwig’s job as a professional storyteller.
Gerwig and her partner, the filmmaker Noah Baumbach, wrote the script under unusual circumstances. After they participated in a Barbie boot camp put on by Mattel, which began with a history lesson on Barbie inventor Ruth Handler and involved a tour of Barbie’s most fabulous (and regrettable) fashions, the pandemic struck. Cloistered in their home in New York, the duo didn’t receive the typical studio notes as they drafted. “We worked hard to give them their space and let them come up with what the movie was going to be, uninterrupted, without people pushing an agenda on them—not Mattel, not Warner Bros., not us,” says Robbie, 32, whose company LuckyChap produced the film. “And then when I saw the script, I was like, ‘They’re never going to let us do this. This is really pushing it.’”

So, what exactly is this movie? Even with the onslaught of pink-tinged marketing, Warner Bros. has managed to keep the plot under wraps. I’m not here to spoil the film, which I watched in Gerwig’s temporary office, a gray space in Chelsea accessorized with a magenta Barbie doormat. But I can share that it’s a fun yet self-aware romp with shades of Clueless and Legally Blonde. It’s also stuffed full of ideas, and occasionally overwhelmed by them.

The movie is set in Barbie Land, a utopia where each Barbie has an impressive job. As Helen Mirren’s narrator wryly tells us, “all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.” The Barbies have sleepovers every night during which they declare how beautiful and confident they feel. The Kens (played by Gosling and Simu Liu, among others) exist as convenient dance partners. But then Robbie’s Barbie begins to think about mortality. Those arched feet go flat. Cellulite appears on her thigh. To combat these changes, she must venture into the real world with Ken, who has been feeling like a mere accessory in Barbie’s dream life. The real world is, well, real. Men in suits at Mattel—led by Will Ferrell’s CEO—make disingenuous speeches about female empowerment; preteens dress Barbie down for wreaking havoc on their self-esteem. Both Barbie and Ken go on quests of self-discovery, and that’s when things get really interesting. (I won’t give away Ken’s story, but Gosling nearly steals the show.)
There’s also a surprisingly balletic musical number that appears to be inspired by Grease and Singin’ in the Rain; a car-chase sequence; a mysterious woman in a kitchen; and a running gag about Sylvester Stallone’s penchant for mink coats. And that’s all before things turn philosophical.
Every single actor I spoke to cited Gerwig and the sharp script as the reason they joined the film. “I knew this was not going to shy away from the parts of Barbie that are more interesting but potentially a little bit more fraught,” says Hari Nef, who plays a doctor Barbie. “The contemporary history of feminism and body positivity—there are questions of how Barbie can fit into all of that.”
Those points proved more controversial with the corporate entities involved. Robbie Brenner, the first-ever executive producer of Mattel Films and the architect of its cinematic universe, told the company’s top brass, “You’re just gonna white-knuckle it the whole time.”
Gerwig earned the toymaker’s trust with the help of Robbie. At one point Richard Dickson, COO and president of Mattel, says he took a flight to the London set to argue with Gerwig and Robbie over a particular scene, which he felt was off-brand. Dickson dials up his natural boyish exuberance, imitating himself righteously marching off the plane to meet them. But Gerwig and Robbie performed the scene for him and changed his mind. “When you look on the page, the nuance isn’t there, the delivery isn’t there,” explains Robbie.

Robbie had laid the groundwork for this with Mattel’s CEO when she met with him in 2018 in the hopes that LuckyChap could take on the Barbie project. “In that very first meeting, we impressed upon Ynon we are going to honor the legacy of your brand, but if we don’t acknowledge certain things—if we don’t say it, someone else is going to say it,” she says. “So you might as well be a part of that conversation.”
Kreiz has hosted several pivotal meetings about Barbie at the Polo Lounge, a see-and-be-seen spot in the Beverly Hills Hotel. It’s where he met Robbie for the first time, and where he invited Brenner to discuss running Mattel’s film division. And so, too, Kreiz invites me, without a hint of irony, to the Polo Lounge to talk about all the other Barbie conversations that took place there. Kreiz was the fourth Mattel CEO in four years when he took over in 2018. He orchestrated a turnaround that included courting Hollywood’s biggest talent with an exacting pitch that has proven to be persuasive. “It’s not about making movies so that we can go and sell more toys,” he says. “We’ve been doing well selling toys without movies.” (The movie does help: the day a Margot Robbie Barbie went on sale, it became the No. 1 doll on Amazon.)
“The most important transition was from being a toy-manufacturing company that was making items to becoming an IP company that is managing franchises,” he says. It’s a particularly prescient strategy at a moment when superhero fatigue has set in and studios are desperate to find new intellectual property with a built-in fan base—from Super Mario Bros. to Dungeons & Dragons. Mattel has announced 14 more movies based on its toys, including a J.J. Abrams–produced Hot Wheels movie and (intriguingly) a Barney film with Daniel Kaluuya. The expansion also includes more streaming shows, video games, and a Mattel theme park currently under construction in Arizona.
From an outdoor table covered in leaves, Kreiz points out the spot where he and Robbie met. The CEO had been as eager to talk with Robbie as she had been to pursue a Barbie film. Before he hired Brenner as executive producer of Mattel Films, he asked who she thought should play the iconic doll. She too said Robbie. “She’s very funny, she’s deep, she’s a fantastic actress, and she does look like …” Brenner pauses. “She’s beautiful.”
It’s obvious why both executives zeroed in on Robbie. She looks like Barbie. Or, as the film says, she looks like “Stereotypical Barbie.” The distinction is important. Just eight years back, in 2015, Barbie’s sales had sunk to $900 million, the lowest in 25 years. So in 2016, Mattel made the biggest change to the doll since she debuted in 1959. In a TIME cover story, I reported on how, after rolling out a wider array of skin tones and hair types for the dolls, Mattel launched three new body types, including Curvy Barbie. It (eventually) worked. Barbie sales rose and hit a record $1.7 billion in 2021 before a small industry-wide slump last year.
Mattel had been toying with the idea of a Barbie movie since 2009. Big stars (Amy Schumer, Anne Hathaway) and prominent directors like Patty Jenkins were rumored to be attached before Robbie met with the company in 2018. One of the reasons Mattel resisted bringing Barbie to the big screen for so long is because the company worked hard to modernize the brand and establish that Barbie is not one body, one personality, one woman. There are currently 175 different Barbies, with different combinations of body shapes, skin tones, and hair types. And yet, here is Margot Robbie on the poster as the manifestation of Barbie. There’s a moment in the film where Mirren makes a tongue-in-cheek joke about Robbie being too beautiful to feel insecure.
Dickson argues that Barbie has to look like Robbie to get audiences who haven’t followed Mattel’s latest updates into theaters. “Of course she looks like Barbie,” he says. “But they’re all Barbie. It’s the perfect cast to express what Barbie is today. And Margot is the bridge.”

Robbie is flattered that the Mattel execs thought of her, but she would never have wanted to play the only Barbie. “If [Mattel] hadn’t made that change to have a multiplicity of Barbies, I don’t think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film,” she says. “I don’t think you should say, ‘This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that’s what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.’”
Issa Rae, 38, who plays President Barbie, argues that the entire point of the film is to portray a world in which there isn’t a singular ideal. “My worry was that it was going to feel too white feminist-y, but I think that it’s self-aware,” she says. “Barbie Land is perfect, right? It represents perfection. So if perfection is just a bunch of white Barbies, I don’t know that anybody can get on board with that.”

But it seems Mattel was resistant to appearing too modern. In a recent interview, Amy Schumer revealed that she left her Barbie movie because it wasn’t “feminist and cool,” as she assumes Gerwig’s will be. Dickson, who was in the C-suite at Mattel for other movie discussions, doesn’t comment on Schumer but reflects on past experiences: “It was a matter of finding the right talent that can appreciate the brand’s authenticity and bring that controversy to life in a way that, yes, pokes fun at us but ultimately is purposeful and has heart.”
Still, in an interview for this story, Brenner called Gerwig’s film “not a feminist movie,” a sentiment echoed by other Mattel executives I spoke with. It was a striking contrast to my interpretation of the film and conversations with many of the actors, who used that term unprompted to describe the script. When I relay Mattel’s words to Robbie, she raises an eyebrow. “Who said that?” she asks then sighs. “It’s not that it is or it isn’t. It’s a movie. It’s a movie that’s got so much in it.” The bigger point, Robbie impresses upon me, is “we’re in on the joke. This isn’t a Barbie puff piece.”
Barbie’s Corvette isn’t any old convertible with a slick of pink paint. If you place the doll in her car, it’s too small—the windshield ends at her chest. And so Gerwig insisted the life-size version must be a little small for Robbie. Barbie’s vehicle was carefully created as a model, and scaled up using a mathematical formula to ensure everything in Barbie Land looked “toyetic.”

Gerwig’s team built an entire neighborhood made up of Dream Houses that were missing walls. The actors had to be secured by wires so they wouldn’t topple off the second floors. The skies and clouds in the background were hand-painted to render a playroom-like quality, as was much of the rest of the set.
“From a production perspective, it’s bigger than anything we’ve done before,” says Tom Ackerley, 33, Robbie’s producing partner and husband. “We wanted it to feel like you could reach into the screen and touch it.” LuckyChap enlisted David Heyman, who produced the Harry Potter films, to help create this fantastical world. “I don’t think we have seen or will ever see a film with more pink in it,” says Heyman. Gerwig jokingly nicknamed the duo Ken David and Ken Tom.
Not everyone in the film had as robust a relationship with Barbie growing up as Gerwig did. Kate McKinnon preferred to play with shells she found on the beach or small plastic zoo animals. “I didn’t see myself in Barbie when I was younger,” she says. “I saw myself in an inflatable lobster.”
Nef, Rae, Shipp, Robbie and McKinnon photographed in Los Angeles on June 8 Carlota Guerrero for TIME
But McKinnon, 39, watched her sister and friends play with the dolls: they cut Barbie’s hair, drew on her face, and even set her on fire. She theorizes, “They were externalizing how they felt, and they felt different.” So when Gerwig offered McKinnon the role of Weird Barbie, a doll that’s been played with a little too aggressively in the real world, she jumped at the chance. McKinnon was impressed by the way the script dealt with girls’ complicated attachments to the doll. “It comments honestly about the positive and negative feelings,” she says. “It’s an incisive cultural critique.”
Alexandra Shipp, who plays an author Barbie, also projected onto the dolls as a child. Shipp, 31, rode on Warner Bros.’ Barbie float in the West Hollywood Pride Parade this year and reflects that Barbie helped her explore aspects of her identity. “When you’re a kid, your toys are an extension of who you are and how you can exist in the world as an adult,” says Shipp. “Sure, I had Kens, but when I played house, I had two Barbies raising a Skipper.”
On social media, Nef, 30, published a letter she wrote to Gerwig and Robbie asking to play one of the Barbies in the film. She says that as a trans woman, she feels ambivalent about the word doll, a slang term in queer culture for trans women, particularly those who celebrate the high femme. The word can feel at once aspirational and oppressive. “It’s a tricky word that holds, for me anyway, such a strict standard created by the patriarchy that deserves to be scrutinized but also a promise of liberation and safety and belonging,” she says. “At the very least, there’s a juicy performance as a doll somewhere in there.”
The world may be obsessed with Barbie’s feet, but Gerwig would like to draw my attention to Barbie’s hands. The director is holed up in New York City putting the final touches on the movie, and she’s eager to dig into its minutiae. The PR team reminds me that our Zoom call is long over, but Gerwig needs a few more minutes to point out that there is a specific image in the film that bears a striking resemblance to Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam. She starts to point a finger downward, excitedly mimicking the moment in which God bestows life on the first man. Except, in Gerwig’s filmed fresco, Barbie creator Ruth Handler’s hand touches Barbie’s hand.
“It’s on the same trajectory and angle as the Sistine Chapel,” she says. “Nobody is going to notice that so I have to say it.” There’s a lot to unpack in the notion of Handler as God, creating the perfect woman, to be placed in an idyllic matriarchy—and the inevitable chaos that will ensue when Barbie leaves this paradise. But anytime I get too deep into references or the politics of this film with Gerwig or the actors, I’m quickly reminded by an executive or a producer that it’s a fun summer romp.
Mattel has engineered tie-ins that range from clothes to beauty to home decor Shoes: Aldo; Float: Funboy; Clip: Kitsch; Jacket: Gap; rug: Ruggable; Skates: Impala Skate
And it is, in part. It’s a mashup of corporate ambition and personal quirk. Perhaps that’s a triumph in an era when movies about products are en vogue. In the past several months alone we’ve gotten films based on a Nike shoe (Air), an obsolete smartphone (BlackBerry), and a snack (Flamin’ Hot). For Mattel, Barbie is just the beginning. Kreiz enthuses about the possibility of “more Barbie movies.”
Robbie hedges. She’s been involved in conversations, but nothing is set. “It could go a million different directions from this point,” she says. “But I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels.”
It’s hard to imagine a sequel, or any other toy movie for that matter, making the splash that Barbie already has. “We’re looking to create movies that become cultural events,” Kreiz says, and to do that Mattel needs visionaries to produce something more intriguing than a toy ad. “If you can excite filmmakers like Greta and Noah to embrace the opportunity and have creative freedom, you can have a real impact.”
Gerwig herself admits “sometimes these movies can have a quality of hegemonic capitalism” and she had to find ways to make the movie her own. She wove in footage of the cast and crew’s friends and family, including images Robbie has filmed herself on a Super 8 over the years, to give the film a personal touch. It’s a home movie smack-dab in the heart of a summer blockbuster, and Gerwig cries every time she watches that part. “It’s like sneaking in humanity to something that everybody thinks is a hunk of plastic.”

2023-07-26 17:12:01.160000+00:00,‘Barbie’ movie’s ending is an important reminder for women’s health,A CNN medical analyst answers questions so you learn more about why “Barbie”’s final scene matters.,"CNN —
SPOILER Alert: Do not read past this line if you haven’t seen “Barbie.”
After all of Barbie’s glories and misadventures on the path to becoming human, moviegoers leave her at a pivotal moment at the close of the new film.
That moment isn’t starting an extraordinary astronaut job or winning a Nobel Prize or even realizing authentic human beauty: It’s a gynecologist appointment.
In the film, the character Ruth Handler (who in real life invented the doll) explains that “Barbie” doesn’t have an ending. Instead, the movie closes with Barbie beginning the full human experience.
Why is something as ordinary as a doctor’s appointment important enough for the final scene of the film? What makes this regular inconvenience a unifying entry into womanhood?
To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
The final scene in ""Barbie"" is important for normalizing women's health, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. Actor Margot Robbie is shown as the title character. Jaap Buitendijk/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
CNN: Do we give enough attention to women’s reproductive health?
Dr. Leana Wen: Reproductive health care is still not regarded as part of total health and well-being. This applies not only to people in their reproductive years but also those who are undergoing menopause and need care during and post menopause.
Much more needs to be done around reproductive health, including investment in research and medical care.
CNN: Why might it be important that “Barbie” culminated in a gynecologist appointment?
Wen: Having everyone see Barbie go to the gynecologist normalizes the experience. It solidifies the understanding that reproductive health is an integral part of overall health.
I hope that will be one of the main takeaways from the scene, which is that every girl, every woman, every person who has female reproductive organs should seek regular preventive care to address their reproductive health.
CNN: What’s the age that teens should have their first appointment with a gynecologist?
Wen: Teens should begin their first reproductive health visit between the ages of 13 and 15 years old, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This is a general preventive health visit in which the health care provider begins to establish a relationship of trust with the patient in a one-on-one, confidential setting.
There will be opportunity to discuss specific concerns, if there are any, and the provider will document the patient’s medical history and perform a physical exam. Generally, an internal pelvic exam is not done unless there are specific symptoms, such as pelvic pain. If the patient has not yet had their vaccines against human papillomavirus (or HPV), a leading cause of cervical cancer, this will be offered, too.
It’s important to note that while, during this discussion, we use the terminology of “girls” and “women,” the reproductive health visit I’m referring to applies to anyone with female reproductive organs. Anyone with a cervix can have cervical cancer, regardless of whether they identify as female, male or nonbinary, and all of these individuals should heed the recommendation to begin reproductive health visits during adolescence.
CNN: How often should women and people with female reproductive health organs see a gynecologist?
Wen: Visits are recommended annually for preventive care and screenings. There can be more frequent visits when specific concerns arise. For instance, women with heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding may need additional testing to find out the cause.
CNN: What occurs during these visits?
Wen: It depends on the patient’s age and whether they are seeing other health care providers. Many women only see a gynecologist for their health care, and if that’s the case, there may need to be additional attention paid to screen for medical issues such as diabetes, anxiety and hypertension. Others have a primary care doctor and visit a gynecologist solely for reproductive health concerns; if that’s the case, the visit can be more limited to sexual and reproductive issues.
The gynecology visit generally begins with getting basic measurements: Your height and weight are taken and blood pressure and heart rate checked. The physician (or nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant) will discuss your medical history, your family history of certain illnesses, and your sexual and reproductive health history.
Some questions you may be asked include: At what age did you begin menstrual periods, and how often do they occur? Do you have symptoms like pelvic pain, discharge and such? What is your gender identity and sexual orientation? Are you sexually active with men, women or both? Are you monogamous, or do you have multiple sexual partners? Have you been pregnant before? Are you looking to become pregnant, and if not, what kind of birth control do you use?
There will be a general physical exam, but whether there is an internal exam depends on your age and symptoms you report. If you have no symptoms, there is generally no internal exam until the Pap test looking for cervical cancer is due.
The recommendation for Pap tests is that they begin at age 21, followed by Pap testing every three years until age 29. From age 30, cervical cancer screenings continue in the same manner or could be done using HPV testing or an HPV/Pap combined test every five years.
Of course, these recommendations would be different in individuals with elevated risk. Also, depending on what other symptoms you report, the provider may recommend additional testing — for example, blood tests looking for anemia in someone reporting heavy menstrual bleeding, or screening for sexually transmitted infections.
CNN: Why are regular appointments important?
Wen: Everyone should have a health care provider that they see on a regular basis. That’s the person they can ask any and all health questions of, no matter how uncomfortable or embarrassing.
For many women, that person is their gynecologist. Regular appointments, at least once a year, are important for preventive purposes and to establish an ongoing relationship. Going annually gives an opportunity to detect new issues, like rising blood pressure or depression. It allows your provider to keep track of screenings you may need, including for breast and cervical cancer. And the ongoing relationship gives you someone you can contact if new issues arise between visits.
I want to add a personal note about the importance of regular screenings. I was diagnosed with cervical cancer in my late 20s, during a routine Pap test. It was early stage, and surgery cured the cancer. I have not had a recurrence, and I have been fortunate to have two children after that. Cancer screenings save lives, and having a provider who ensures you follow the latest recommendations on frequency of screenings is essential.
CNN: What if it’s hard to make an appointment with a gynecologist? Can patients see another health care provider?
Wen: Yes, though it must be a provider who is comfortable with addressing all aspects of your reproductive health care.
Personally, I see an internal medicine physician who is well-versed with reproductive health care and comfortable with my cervical cancer history. Many family physicians and primary care providers will be well-positioned to take care of your reproductive health needs, but some may not perform Pap exams themselves or have experience with certain aspects of care (for example, inserting intrauterine devices for birth control). Ask ahead, and if they are the only option for you, you could also ask them for specialist recommendations if and when specific care is needed.
CNN: What questions and topic areas should women ask about during their visits?
Wen: This will depend, again, on whether the gynecologist visit is your only source of medical care. If so, you should ask all your medical questions during this visit. If not, you can focus your questions on issues centering on reproductive care. Do you have any new or concerning symptoms, including issues like vaginal itching or pain during sex? Is your birth control working for you, or do you want to discuss other options? Remember that there is no question that you should feel too scared or uncomfortable asking. This is the reason your doctor is there, to help you stay healthy and well.

,‘Barbie’ movie’s marketing budget is off the charts—and now they’ve created a real Malibu Dreamhouse where you can stay for free on Airbnb,The Barbie movie is coming out this summer—and the marketing team behind the release keeps ramping up their efforts.,"It’s time to make your childhood dreams come true, because Barbie’s Dreamhouse has mysteriously surfaced high in the hills of Malibu, Calif.—and you can stay there overnight.
The listing on Airbnb has been posted by none other than Ken himself, who says that while Barbie is ""away"" this summer she has handed over the keys to her kingdom.
Bookings for the giant pink property—complete with a life-sized pool, workout area and ocean views—will open on July 17 for a single night stay.
The listing adds the dream sleepover for two guests is free, explaining: ""Ken’s thing is beach, not math.""
The Airbnb post comes as the viral marketing campaign for the Barbie movie continues to ramp up ahead of the film's debut on July 21.
Children's toy brand and Barbie maker Mattel has enjoyed renewed interest since the Greta Gerwig-directed movie was announced—resulting in a flurry of new brand collaborations and merchandise being announced.
Among the launches include a themed X-box console, a shoe collection with footwear brand Aldo, a collaboration with homeware designer brand Ruggable, official Barbie skates from Impala, as well as toothbrushes, suitcases and more.
Marketeers for the movie have also moved into the experience market, with Warner Bros set to host a Barbie Boat Cruise in Boston at the end of June.

How much of Barbie's reported $100 million budget is being devoted to marketing initiatives like the DreamHouse remains to be seen—and when it comes to the Airbnb listing there's also a twist.
Although the house is decked out in the ""iconic"" pink of the fictional doll character—brought to life in the film by Margot Robbie—it's actually her male counterpart Ken playing host.
The DreamHouse has been decorated ""Ken's Way"" with the bedroom decked out in cowboy paraphernalia and a rollerblade rink added to the outside space.
The listing explains Ken—played by Ryan Gosling in the movie—has added ""a few touches to bring some much-needed Kenergy to the newly renovated and iconic Malibu DreamHouse.""
Story continues
The DreamHouse offer is also not a competition, the listing explicitly states, people merely need to log in to Airbnb at 10 a.m. PDT on July 17 to be in with a chance to book one of the two stays on offer.
While staying at the property—which is based on the famous Mattel doll house design—guests can also enjoy a couple of Ken's favorite activities.
These include ""learning a line dance or two on Ken’s outdoor disco dance floor or performing a sunset serenade on Ken’s guitar"", ""taking a spin through Ken’s awesome wardrobe"" and ""challenging their fellow guests to a 'beach off'""—which seems to be simply sunbathing.
And whoever manages to land the DreamHouse stay will also be taking home some of that famous merch, with the listing adding the guests will be ""taking home a piece of the Kendom with their very own set of yellow-and-pink Impala skates and surfboards.""
It's not the first time the creators behind the Barbie movie have given a glimpse into how much work it takes to bring a toy house to life. Margot Robbie showed Architectural Digest around the DreamHouse set, revealing everything from a multi-story slide to an intricately designed wardrobe.

About the house
The house is built across three different floors and has a slide leading from the first floor to the ground floor lawn.
In the middle of the property is a disco-themed roller rink, overlooking an infinity pool, outdoor sofa area and Malibu beach.
Ken's bedroom opens up onto the lawn and pool, and is kitted out with cowboy-themed decor as well as a wardrobe ready to be raided by the guests.
An outdoor gym and pink-covered barbecue station is in the garden, as well as a rooftop hangout spot with a telescope to look out over the ocean.
Of course Barbie has no need to eat while she's in residence so there is no fully-functioning kitchen on the site, but thankfully for the Airbnb guests catering comes with the trip.
The roller rink—with a disco ball hanging overhead—looks out over the sea and has a light-up floor and DJ booth ready for guests to dance the night away.

The ""Barbie"" movie is almost here, and the cast of the film is opening up about how the movie is reimagining and reframing the iconic doll from childhood.
""She's so well known, she's such a globally recognized name,"" Margot Robbie told ""Good Morning America"" in an interview before the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike began last week. ""But more than that, I was both scared and excited by the idea that people were gonna come into this movie already feeling very strongly about the protagonist.""
One of the themes that director Greta Gerwig explores in the film is the patriarchy and what a world with women leaders across every facet of society would look like.
Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera and Issa Rae appear in this still from a taped interview for ABC News. ABC News
For example, Issa Rae plays President Barbie, and Barbie Land has all women justices on its Supreme Court.
""That's exactly why I wanted Greta to do this movie,"" Robbie said. ""I think in a lot of other hands, a Barbie movie would remain surface level. But I knew Greta was gonna have a lot to say, and I knew she was gonna Trojan Horse a lot of -- big issues within a very fun world.""
""It's a way to look at something through the eyes of the Kens where you think, 'Oh, I see what they've done there,'"" Gerwig said. ""It's not so great when you're the accessory.""

When asked about representation in Gerwig's film, which includes a diverse cast of Barbies, Rae recalled Christie, a doll from Mattel that was introduced in 1968 and is considered the first Black Barbie.
""Stepping onto that set was part of the beauty,"" Rae said. ""There was just so much representation, there was so much for everyone. Christie walked so I could run for president. But there's that legacy there of -- there wouldn't be a Black Barbie without Christie.""

This weekend, I was among the masses flocking to see Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, adding my 20 bucks to the film’s history-making $155 million opening weekend. Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as “stereotypical” Barbie and Ken, Gerwig’s film is as much of a celebration of pink as it is a call to smash the patriarchy. (Plus, there’s a killer soundtrack.)
Overall, Barbie has delighted viewers and critics alike—Rotten Tomatoes gives it an “audience score” and “Tomatometer” ranking of 90 percent. But it turns out Barbie’s central feminist message—why are so many men running the world?—seems to be getting to certain, you guessed it, men.
In fact, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, clearly the most secure man of all time, posted a 43-minute YouTube video on Saturday, in which he bashes the “flaming garbage” movie, throws a bunch of Barbies into a trash can, and sets them alight, along with a Ken doll and a plastic pink car.

“Frantic, uncheerful, and graceless, Barbie symbolizes a culture that devalues childhood and goodness.” —Armond White, National Review, July 20
“I made it a drinking game where I take a shot every time the movie says ‘patriarchy.’ I’m now in the hospital with liver failure and I only made it 1 hour into the movie” —JNewps17, July 23
“I don’t like this movie their trying to Brian wash us 😒 I hate movies like this I definitely won’t be watching these types of movies anymore. I should of watch freedom movie. next time.” —zel, July 23
“This movie was dog 💩” —Taylor F, July 23
“Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling can’t save story captured by man-hating agenda.” —Christian Toto, HollywoodinToto.com, July 19
“This is further proof of the disintegration of American intelligence. The only reason people went was because of the PR effort and brain washed masses. Sorry to say I was one. PLEASE do not spend money on this horrible fiasco.” —Ed, July 23
“Terrible movie. Terrible hateful plot. Lots of inappropriate jokes for young girls.” —Rob B., July 23
“For the first 30 minutes or so Barbie is a fun, feather-weight satire…Then the stuff about patriarchy kicks in and the film turns into a thinly disguised #metoo rant, trading comedy for man-bashing and a lot of confused point-scoring about sexism.” Jim Schembri, Jimschembri.com, July 19
“Its brain cancer in movie form… its just a man hating propoganda film” —Mike, July 23
“Borring femist movie” —Jordan M, July 23
“this is a movie charged with man-hating hidden in glitters and hot pink” —Jenna G, July 23
These feminists could not leave this movie alone. It only had to be a fun childrens movie with a positive message but no. Idealogy reigns supreme” —Allan G, July 23
“Terrible movie. More a drama than a comedy. Waste of good actors. As all the Hollywood now just trying to do what is politically correct.” —Robert, July 22
“They completely ruined Barbie. They took every bit of sparkle and enjoyment out of what she was meant to be. The creators of Barbie should sue for defamation. Save your money if you have any belief in family values.” Alicia, July 21
“Why does every movie try to teach me a lesson about something? Why can’t I just be entertained…” —Anonymous, July 23

On Tuesday ""Barbie"" topped $537 million, making it the highest-grossing domestic movie in Warner Bros. Discovery 's 100-year history. The film surpassed Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" which generated $536 million in 2008, for the title.
The bubblegum pink collaboration between filmmaker Greta Gerwig, Mattel and Warner Bros. has collected more than $1.2 billion at the global box office since its July 21 release.
It is the first billion-dollar film for the newly minted Warner Bros. Discovery, the result of the Warner Media and Discover merger in 2022, and only the second movie released in 2023 to do so. Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" has topped $1.3 billion since its April debut.
The success of ""Barbie"" comes at a time when blockbuster-budgeted films have struggled to connect with moviegoing audiences. Alongside Nolan's latest feature ""Oppenheimer,"" which has grossed more than $250 million domestically, ""Barbie"" proves that moviegoers are still interested in leaving their couches for quality films and unique communal experiences.
The Margot Robbie-led film has been number one at the box office since its debut and is on track to be the highest-grossing film of the year. Box office analysts expect ""Barbie"" to continue to collect box office receipts in the weeks to come, as it faces limited competition from new releases and rides a wave of positive word of mouth.

While Mattel will report second-quarter results on Wednesday, days after the theatrical release of the movie, analysts say the boost for Barbie sales will be most pronounced in the quarter ending Sept. 29 before tapering off.
The company will likely get a small cut of the movie's box-office innings, though the biggest benefit is expected to come from toy sales following the marketing blitz around its release. Retailers worldwide have also pitched in, with brands from Zara (ITX.MC) to H&M (HMb.ST) and Gap rolling out themed merchandise like Barbie hoodies, perfumes and toothbrushes.
UBS' Arpiné Kocharyan expects the movie's release to have an ""overall halo effect"" on the franchise, with the larger opportunity in consumer products as the film targets an older audience.
""This might not move the needle for revenues, but could impact Mattel's earnings, given substantially higher margin of more than 80% on royalty stream,"" Kocharyan added.
The live-action movie, which also stars Ryan Gosling as Ken, raked in $155 million in the United States and Canada over the weekend, making it the biggest opening at the box office for 2023, distributor Warner Bros said on Sunday.

Still, not everyone seemed convinced.
""Although there is plenty of buzz around the film, I don't expect the movie to generate a significant boost to sales for Mattel as the movie isn't geared towards the target market (young children) and is rated PG-13,"" said Zachary Warring, equity analyst at CFRA Research.
Carol Osborne, a marketing faculty at University of South Florida's Muma College of Business, said the hype around the ""Barbification of the world"" will soon subside.
For the second quarter, Mattel is set to report falling sales and a net loss of 2 cents per share, compared with a profit of 18 cents a year ago, as the company continues to reel from higher costs, slowing consumer spending amid high inflation, and retailers cutting back on inventories.
Barbie was Mattel's top brand from 2019 to 2022, according to company data. But its gross billings - or the amount invoiced to customers - fell behind Hot Wheels in the first quarter of 2023.
The toymaker's shares, which have gained about 19% so far in 2023, were up about 1.4% in premarket trading on Monday. Rival Hasbro's shares have risen (HAS.O) 5% this year.
Mattel's forward 12-month price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 16.01, higher than 13.6 for Hasbro.

,Local Barbie influencer takes part in the 'Barbie' movie marketing blitz,"A local Barbie influencer is taking part in the ""Barbie"" movie marketing blitz.","LOS ANGELES — As the highly anticipated Barbie movie hits theaters, the marketing campaign behind the iconic doll has been nothing short of monumental.
Azusa Sakamoto, a Barbie influencer based in West Hollywood, has loved Barbie long before the movie. Her apartment serves as a personal Barbie Dreamhouse, adorned with over 500 dolls and Barbie-themed accessories.
Sakamoto, who is originally from Japan, became fascinated with Barbie at age 15 and dreamed of being a Barbie influencer before the term was coined.
With a combined audience of over 250,000 followers on Instagram and YouTube, Sakamoto’s influence was harnessed as a resource to amplify the Barbie movie’s marketing efforts.
The Barbie movie campaign, with a reported budget of $100 million, collaborated with over 35 brands, from Zara to Cold Stone Creamery to Bumble, creating a ubiquitous presence that resonated with consumers.
According to Jordan Cuddy, EVP, Global Head of Experience at Media.Monks, the success of the Barbie marketing lies in its ability to meet consumers where they are and engage them through relevant channels.
“It was just a masterclass and giving a film and an IP, a brand layer,” Cuddy said.
Sakamoto, along with countless Barbie fans, rejoices at the world’s growing awareness of Barbie.

2023-07-13 07:00:00-04:00,"How Hollywood appeases China, explained by the Barbie movie",Vietnam banned Barbie over a map featuring the nine-dash line. Here’s why.,"This surely wasn’t the kind of publicity that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie was hoping for. The long-awaited film adaptation of the Mattel doll made headlines when, two weeks before its July 21 theatrical debut, it was banned in, of all places, Vietnam. And not because of any explicit violence or plastic nudity, but for violating the country’s territorial sovereignty.
The controversy concerns a map of the “real world” that appears when Margot Robbie’s Barbie is told she must leave Barbieland and enter the real world after her perfectly arched feet have inexplicably turned flat. Shown for only a split second, the map looks as if it were drawn by a child — one who likes bright colors and has failed geography class. Among a mess of shapes and scribbles, one oddly specific detail stood out to reviewers from Vietnam’s National Film Evaluation Council: a dotted, U-shaped trail crossing into the ocean from what’s supposed to be China.
As far as the council is concerned, this is no ordinary doodle, but a clear and deliberate representation of the so-called nine-dash line: a maritime boundary demarcating Beijing’s contested ownership of the South China Sea. The line has been featured on Chinese maps since the 1940s and, despite being rejected by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 2016, is still used today to justify the expansion of China’s naval presence in the region, its construction of artificial islands, and its intimidation of foreign fishermen.
“To the Chinese, the nine-dash line signifies their legitimate claims to the South China Sea,” Peter Zinoman, a professor of history and Southeast Asian studies at UC Berkeley and author of The Colonial Bastille: A History of Imprisonment in Vietnam, 1862-1940, tells Vox. “To the Vietnamese, it symbolizes a brazen act of imperialist bullying that elevates Chinese national interest over an older shared set of interests of socialist brotherhood.” For this reason, Barbie will not be screening in Vietnamese theaters.
To some extent, however, the damage has already been done. “As if the balancing act of stoking and restraining domestic nationalism wasn’t hard enough,” NYU professor and historian of modern Vietnam Kevin Li tells Vox, “pressure from an outside voice actively calling the government’s legitimacy into question on territorial grounds complicates things further. The Republic of Vietnam had, after all, fought the Chinese for [the South China Sea] during the last years of the Vietnam War. In my view, banning [Barbie] was a no-brainer.”
The film has also raised security concerns in Washington, where politicians doubt the Warner Bros. Film Group’s assertion that the map’s resemblance to the nine-dash line was purely accidental. “While it may just be a Barbie map in a Barbie world,” Mike Gallagher, a Republican representative of Wisconsin leading the House’s China committee, told Politico, “the fact that a cartoonish, crayon-scribbled map seems to go out of its way to depict the PRC’s unlawful territorial claims illustrates the pressure that Hollywood is under to please CCP censors.”
It’s no secret that American studios cater to China and its $4.6 billion film industry — they have been doing so for over two decades, at times to great success. However, the nature of their partnership is changing. The way it used to work, Wall Street Journal reporter Erich Schwartzel tells Vox, “Hollywood producers would bend over backward to appeal to Chinese audiences. If they thought casting a Chinese actor in a small role or filming certain scenes in China would help sell tickets there, they would do that.” Think Disney adding a panda character to the Chinese release of Zootopia, or Transformers 4: Age of Extinction being partially set in Hong Kong and starring Li Bingbing and Han Geng in addition to a host of extras selected through a Chinese reality show.
“That kind of reverse engineering has died down,” adds Schwartzel, who wrote a book on the subject titled Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy. “Now, it’s more about not including anything in your movie that risks angering the state.” This explains why Doctor Strange changed the ethnicity of the Ancient One, a spiritual leader living in a mountainous monastery, from Tibetan to Caucasian, why Bohemian Rhapsody removed all references to Freddie Mercury being gay, and why Top Gun: Maverick originally removed the Taiwanese flag from Pete Mitchell’s flight jacket. (It reappeared after protests from fans and the departure of investor Tencent; as a result, the film never played in China.)
Still, there is an important difference between, say, turning a film’s antagonist from Chinese to North Korean, as was done in the 2012 Red Dawn remake, and displaying a map that recognizes Beijing’s highly disputed control over the vast majority of the South China Sea. As the theatrical world shrinks, the CCP’s control over Chinese society tightens, and the cooling of US-China relationship complicates international business relations, we might soon end up in a reality where — in addition to removing content that offends Beijing —Hollywood will “go out of its way,” as Gallagher had put it, to insert content affirming the party’s worldview.
“Aiming for the PRC market, they are ready to accept the PRC’s view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.”
This, many believe, was the case for Barbie. “The producers of the movie clearly hope it will be a blockbuster,” Hue-Tam Ho Tai, professor of Sino-Vietnamese history at Harvard University, tells Vox. “Aiming for the PRC market, they are ready to accept the PRC’s view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.” It’s worth noting Barbie has already been approved to screen in China, and that manufacturer Mattel has a vested interest in selling its dolls there.
Of course, affirming the CCP worldview comes at a cost. Barbie isn’t the first film to reference the nine-dash line, nor is it the first to be banned in Southeast Asia for doing so. Before surfacing in Barbieland, the line could be discovered in scenes from DreamWorks’ animated family film Abominable, Sony’s live-action adaptation of the video game series Uncharted starring Tom Holland, and an Australian spy drama streaming on Netflix called Pine Gap. Earlier this year, Vietnam even blacklisted John Wick: Chapter 4 for starring Donnie Yen, who is a vocal supporter of CCP policies. (John Wick was briefly available in China but has since been pulled from its platforms alongside other movies with Keanu Reeves after the actor attended a Tibet-related concert.)
Soon, Hollywood will also be facing resistance from the US government, which up until this point has remained largely offscreen. Alarmed by Beijing’s influence over American entertainment, the Pentagon recently announced in a Defense Department document that it will no longer share its bases, ships, and equipment with productions that allow Beijing “to censor the content of the project in a material manner to advance the national interest of the People’s Republic of China.”
Schwartzel suggests it is economic incentive, not political pressure, that could ultimately push Hollywood out of China altogether. As time goes by, breaking into the country’s film market has only gotten more difficult. This is partly due to censorship, but also because of cultural barriers. “Chinese audiences were always much savvier than Hollywood believed them to be,” he says. “A panda in Zootopia is nice, but it is not the real reason people are going to see it.” The same applies to casting Chinese actors in small, forgettable roles, which in China are mockingly referred to as “flower vases.”
Then there’s competition from Chinese cinema, which has grown incredibly sophisticated over the past decade or so. In 2011, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the highest-grossing film in China. Ten years later, in 2021, it was The Battle at Lake Changjin, a historical action epic about the People’s Volunteer Army’s unlikely victory over the US Armed Forces in a major battle during the Korean War. Commissioned by the PRC’s Central Propaganda Department, it brought in an estimated $903 million against an impressive $200 million budget — numbers Hollywood can only dream of at the moment.
While the past and present prevalence of Chinese propaganda in American entertainment poses a significant danger for Americans, who may not always recognize it when it’s in front of them, the situation is even worse for countries not powerful enough to confront China head-on.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS8yMDIzLzcvMTMvMjM3OTE4MDUvYmFyYmllLW1hcC1uaW5lLWRhc2gtbGluZS12aWV0bmFtLWNoaW5h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

How were you able to preserve your sensibility the whole way through this process?
I was originally meant to just write it with Noah, and then we finished the script and that was the thing that made me want to direct it. It felt so clear to me: If they didn’t want to make that [version], I didn’t need to make it. Margot, as the producer and star, was really the first person to line up and say, “I want to do it her way.” And then as we started adding collaborators and gathering more cast, suddenly there was a large number of people who were excited to do something that was this, excuse the pun, out of the box.
Part of me thinks that because it was all so idiosyncratic and so wild, it was almost like no one really knew where to start taking it apart. Like, where are you going to start hacking away at how strange it was? Maybe because there was this sense of sheer joy behind it, it was this hard thing to say, “Oh no, we don’t want that thing that’s sheer joy.” People wanted it to exist, in all its weirdness.
Even the movie’s inciting incident is pretty heady. I’m trying to imagine how the executives reacted when you told them, “Well, things really kick off when Barbie starts having irrepressible thoughts of death.”
I know! We had the idea of the movie starting off like this whirligig, and that line becomes something where she almost breaks the movie. And what do you do after you’ve broken the movie? Her character tries to just keep the movie going normally again, but there’s no way to do it. But yeah, I don’t know that anyone totally knew what the tone of this was going to be until it was all done. I mean, within the group of people who were deeply making it, we knew, but it was truly an act of faith for everyone else.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjUvbW92aWVzL2dyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-11 14:15:04+00:00,We’re Ignoring the Real Reason Barbie Might Dominate the Box Office,"Barbie is the rare movie that's created by women almost exclusively for women, a group that is rarely targeted by Hollywood.","Barbenheimer is nearly upon us. On July 21, two highly anticipated movies will be released on the very same day: Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s movie about the world’s most iconic doll (which we previewed on the cover of this magazine) will face off against Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s epic about the creation of the atom bomb.
Unless your access to the internet has been totally cut off, you’re probably aware that this is happening. Maybe you’ve seen the Barbenheimer memes, often juxtaposing an explosion of Barbie pink next to, well, a real explosion. Or you’ve already bought a T-shirt featuring Margot Robbie’s Barbie tipping her cowboy hat to Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer. A lively debate has ensued on Twitter as to how to best order a double feature: Is Barbie better as a palate cleanser after a World War II film? Or does Barbie feel more like a daytime romp and Oppenheimer suited for a nighttime watch?

All the chatter could be a sign of life for Hollywood as the usual subjects that buoy the box office—superheroes (The Flash), fast cars (Fast X), and animation (Elemental)—have fallen short of their projected profits. For months prognosticators have struggled to figure out how much Barbie might earn. There aren’t too many movies like it: Its protagonist has major name recognition but isn’t part of an existing franchise; the movie is a big-budget spectacle from a director who has, until recently, delivered smaller, thoughtful films about women’s inner lives; big-budget movies with a primarily female cast don’t come around that often. But now initial estimates of a $45 million opening weekend have nearly doubled. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer is still tracking in the $40 million range—a robust total for an adult drama in 2023. Nolan has an excellent record at the box office, but given this particular film’s three-hour runtime and R-rating, the idea that Barbie will come out on top has firmly taken hold.
It’s safe to attribute some of Barbie’s anticipated success to an onslaught of marketing from Mattel and Warner Bros. You cannot cross a street in New York, London, or Sydney without spotting a bus or billboard with Robbie’s face. Mattel has partnered with brands ranging from Bloomingdale’s to Ruggable to Pinkberry to roll out Barbiecore clothing, home decor, and even frozen yogurt. But the real secret to Barbie’s potential box office success has less to do with pink products than its subject and intended audience: Very few movies manage to cater to women without condescending to them.
In today’s fractured moviegoing landscape, that remains a rare feat. Even as representation of all types in Hollywood is improving, the kinds of movies in which women star aren’t stereotypically girly—for better or worse. Only 33% of the top 100 grossing films in 2022 featured female protagonists to begin with, and many of those movies slotted into the sorts of genres that typically cater to men: The Woman King is a historical action epic that happens to star women; Everything Everywhere All at Once is a multiversal movie stuffed with fight scenes that happens to center a mother and daughter; Scream 6 is a sequel to a classic horror flick. The intent with those movies is to reach as broad an audience as possible. They’re all solid to excellent movies. They are also, frankly, devoid of the color pink.

Barbie is unapologetically leaning into a feminine aesthetic. Much of the fun in the film comes from Barbie literally playing dress-up. Gerwig’s team used so much pink paint on the set that they caused a worldwide shortage. And yet even for Barbie skeptics, the approach feels fun, and it’s served up with a wink, like something adults will enjoy as much as little kids. In TIME’s cover story on Barbie, I compared the film to two essential films in the female film canon: Legally Blonde and Clueless. The movie’s basic premise follows a similar trajectory to those cult classics. An underestimated blonde obsessed with clothes ventures into the world and learns something a bit deeper about herself. But it’s also been quite some time since we’ve gotten a big studio movie eager on to take on that type of story. For a generation of nostalgic millennial women who watched those films at sleepovers, Barbie has an inherent appeal.
The people behind some of this summer’s most anticipated movies have decided to embrace the competition. On June 28, Tom Cruise—the star of Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One, which comes out the week before Barbenheimer—gamely posed with movie tickets to Oppenheimer and Barbie, prompting both Gerwig and Robbie to do the same. (Your turn, Murphy and Nolan.)
But Barbie producers are also eager to point out the differences among the movies. During a recent interview for a TIME cover story, David Heyman, a producer on Barbie who has also worked on Harry Potter, Paddington, and Marriage Story, told me that he’s also excited to see Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One and Oppenheimer. “We’re a little bit different than that,” he says. “Those films feature men. Ours will appeal to men, too, but is sort of more youthful in its spirit. I believe our film is distinct and stands out and hopefully will forge its own place.” And perhaps, if Barbie succeeds, we can expect fewer rote superhero films and more movies that are marketed, specifically, to women.

Where did the movies for women go?
Most big-budget movies these days cater to teenage boys: From superhero films to Transformers to Tom Cruise’s stunt-filled action flicks, they’re movies mostly made by men, populated with men, and sold to men. Peruse the top 50 movies at the domestic box office for the last 10 years and you will find one, maybe two, movies made by and for women, starring women, among their numbers.
This isn’t to say that women don’t line up for these films, too. As someone who has made a career of writing about various superhero and action flicks and has never owned a Barbie, I’m happy to admit I rang in 2023 by forcing my party guests to watch the behind-the-scenes video Cruise dring a motorcycle off a cliff for the upcoming Mission: Impossible movie. But the sheer lack of variety of onscreen offerings—everything seems to end in CGI-heavy battle scenes—may explain why we’re in the midst of a superhero slump at the box office.

Where are the alternatives? The death of the big-screen rom-com hastened the death of movies marketed to women. Like all mid-budget films, they fell out of favor with studios eager to earn big bucks on comic book adaptations or awards gold with cheaper ventures. But female-centric films that had more on their minds than romance have largely vanished too. What is the 2020s equivalent of Mean Girls, a movie more concerned with the complexities of female friendships than who got the guy? Or The Devil Wears Prada, a movie about work-life balance struggle that seriously considers consumerism even as it celebrates it? It’s no coincidence these classics feature some of our greatest modern movie stars: Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, among them.
These movies didn’t make a billion dollars at the box office. But they did make money. Devil Wears Prada made over $325 million on a $41 million budget. The closest equivalent to these movies in theaters this year may be Joy Ride, though the raunchy comedy has an R-rating, boxing out the tweens and teens that buoyed Mean Girls to icon status: Joy Ride is currently tracking to make about a third of what Mean Girls did opening weekend.
Movies that unabashedly appeal to women can do well at the box office
History shows us that the few times studios do “take a risk” on a movie marketed primarily to women, the bet can pay off handsomely. The two Mamma Mia! movies have made over $1 billion collectively by virtue of being fun musical diversions. Crazy Rich Asians dominated the box office, becoming the highest grossing romantic comedy of the 2010s, by refusing to apologize for the fact that it was a movie about love, fashion, and travel, all while overdelivering on the abundance of its title. Where romantic comedies have failed since is often in their restraint. A movie like Ticket to Paradise reads and looks like it was filmed with limiting the budget top of mind, even with high-caliber movie stars like Julia Roberts and George Clooney; and excellent rom-coms like Set It Up that are explicitly made for streaming feel like they’re missing that big-screen sheen.
In a slightly different way, Channing Tatum has cornered a part of this market. The Magic Mike trilogy and The Lost City do more than just put forward Tatum as eye candy for the audience. Tatum knowingly revels in the female gaze. These movies also put female movie stars like Sandra Bullock and Salma Hayek front and center. Gosling occupies a not dissimilar role in Barbie—he’s fulfilling the role of the Internet Boyfriend by playing second banana to Barbie. (He’s just Ken). He’s been occupying that corner at least since Crazy Stupid Love and La La Land.
Read More: How Greta Gerwig Is Leading By Example
Greta Gerwig has never made a movie quite at this scale before: Lady Bird cost $10 million, and Little Women $40 million to make, compared to Barbie’s reported $100 million. But she has a proven track record: Those movies made $79 million and $206 million respectively. And according to a recent article in The New Yorker, she has ambitions to become a blockbuster film director with two Narnia adaptations as her next project. But her films have all explored the interiority of women in an intellectual and soul-fulfilling way that she’s now looking to translate to a larger audience on a larger scale.
Barbie could change how studios think about female audiences
Barbie is a lot of things. It’s a comedy, a musical, and an action movie with the occasional chase scene thrown in. It even includes a dramatic sequence in which a bunch of Kens invade a plastic beach like it’s Normandy. It is not a romance. And yet it is definitively for women.
Which isn’t to say it isn’t also for men. The folks at Warner Bros. and Mattel would certainly insist that Barbie is a four-quadrant film. “It’s a movie for everyone,” says Tom Ackerley, another producer on the film who runs the production company LuckyChap with his wife, Margot Robbie. He specifically thinks both boys and men will “relate to Ken’s journey.”
And yet everything associated with the film—the colors, the fashion, the marketing collaboration with makeup brand—lead to a simple fact: many, many women have played with Barbie, according to Mattel, and if they haven’t they probably have an opinion about the doll. Gerwig told me in an interview for the cover story that part of the inspiration from the movie was born from the story of the doll’s creator Ruth Handler and her daughter, Barbara, for whom the doll is named: “A Barbie movie is only ever going to be a mother-daughter movie on so many levels because it was Ruth Handler and Barbara—that was the relationship.”

What separates a good movie for women from a bad one is seriousness of intent. The Devil Wears Prada could have been a materialistic slog, but performances from Anne Hathaway and (especially) Meryl Streep elevate the film. Gerwig found a similarly formidable cast for Barbie: The film is jam-packed with talented stars including Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, and Will Ferrell. But it’s also stuffed with ideas. Look out for the many allusions to the story of Adam and Eve, references to the classic musicals of Hollywood’s golden era, and critiques of capitalism.
Whatever the studio machinations behind the scenes, one fact tends to hold true: Good movies tend to do better at the box office than bad ones. Give lauded filmmakers a chance to color even a little outside the lines—make, say, a movie based on IP but not limited by superhero constraints—and you may just be rewarded by audiences desperate for something different.

2023-08-10 11:41:10+00:00,Lebanon bans ‘Barbie’ movie for ‘promoting homosexuality’,The ban comes amid heightened anti-LGBTQ rhetoric by some politicians and government officials in Lebanon and the wider Middle East.,"CNN —
Authorities in Lebanon moved to ban the “Barbie” movie from cinemas on Wednesday, saying it promotes homosexuality and violates the nation’s values.
Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada banned the film from cinemas after delaying its release date to late August, saying it contradicts the “moral and religious values as well as the principles of Lebanon,” state-run media reported Wednesday.
The minister said the movie also “promotes sexual deviance and transsexuality,” by Lebanese state-run media on Wednesday. “Sexual deviance” is a term commonly used in the Middle East to refer to homosexuals.
The ban comes amid heightened anti-LGBTQ rhetoric by some politicians and government officials in Lebanon and the wider Middle East.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon’s Shiite Islamist Hezbollah movement, launched a tirade against homosexuals in late July during a speech marking Ashura, which commemorates the killing of the Hussain bin Ali, Prophet Mohammed’s grandson, in the 7th century.
He referred to homosexuality as “sexual perversion” and identified same-sex relations as a “threat” to Lebanon.
Days earlier, Nasrallah threatened the LGBTQ community in a video message, encouraging the use of derogatory terms and for them to be punished.
LGBTQ people have reported online harassment and death threats following the speech, Human Rights Watch said in a report.
Lebanon was once considered one of the most socially liberal countries in the Middle East, but the government has been cracking down on LGBTQ events.
Kuwait also moved to ban the “Barbie” movie, claiming it carries “ideas that encourage unacceptable behavior and a message that distorts the prevailing values of society,” according to state-run KUNA news agency.
Anti-LGBTQ sentiment is also on the rise in Iraq, where the state media regulator on Tuesday issued a media ban of the words “homosexuality” and “gender,” requiring it to be replaced with “sexual deviance.” The censorship is in effect for all media outlets, phone and internet companies. There was no penalty set for breaking the rule but a fine was alluded to.
Rainbow flags have been burned in recent protests by Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq in opposition to the Quran burnings in Denmark and Sweden.
“Barbie” blew past box-office expectations, hitting $1 billion in box office revenues three weeks since its release.
The movie was also banned in Vietnam in early July, over a map depicting China’s claim to the South China sea.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8xMC9tZWRpYS9sZWJhbm9uLWJhcmJpZS1iYW4taG9tb3NleHVhbGl0eS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wOC8xMC9tZWRpYS9sZWJhbm9uLWJhcmJpZS1iYW4taG9tb3NleHVhbGl0eS9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,The Secret of the Barbie Movie’s Marketing Success,"Barbie is a genuine phenomenon, reaching $1 billion in worldwide box office in only three weeks on the strength of legions of pink-clad moviegoers. We asked Yale SOM’s Zoe Chance, a former Mattel brand manager, about the movie’s marketing and message.","Many current TV shows and movies are reboots of existing franchises. Why has this one been so culturally omnipresent?
The marketers at Warner Bros are being touted as geniuses, credited with the blockbuster success of the Barbie movie. The movie has already grossed $1 billion in box office sales, with a marketing spend estimated at $150 million and a similar cost for the movie. It’s a great ROI but there are other important factors contributing to the movie’s success.
The real genius was the writer who understood and validated our powerful mixed feelings about Barbie. We loved her, idolized her, chopped off her hair, made fun of her, and felt a little icky about the stereotypes and gender roles she represents.
Barbie is the number-one girls’ brand in the world, and has been for most of her 50-year lifespan. When I worked as a brand manager on Barbie, we were selling a Barbie doll every second, and girls received, on average, five Barbie dolls per year. Mattel reports that more than 90% of girls own a Barbie. Their long-term marketing investment had built up a $700 million brand valuation before the movie released, and this brand has an emotional engagement that translates really well to a film. Many girls play with Barbies every day, telling stories and imagining themselves as Barbie. I can think of no other brand that approaches this level of reach and depth of engagement.
The core movie audience is anyone who used to play with Barbie—90% of women and our teenage daughters. But the real genius was the writer who understood and validated our powerful mixed feelings about Barbie. We loved her, idolized her, chopped off her hair, made fun of her, and felt a little icky about the stereotypes and gender roles she represents. The trailer promises, “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” The secret is that we feel both ways.
Along with the brand value and emotional engagement, the crossover adult/teen targeting made possible the biggest co-branding and licensing coup in…the history of the world, maybe? Warner Brothers and Mattel fully capitalized their crossover licensing opportunities—toys, adult fashion, car insurance, you name it. The theater where I watched the movie was promoting a Barbie-branded pink gin cocktail. (It was pretty good.) Airbnb partnered on an actual Barbie Dream House in Malibu.
Part of the appeal of partnering with Warner Bros. to promote this film was that it wasn’t already a franchise. The release of the first live-action Barbie movie marked a historic moment that would be covered in news outlets, not just entertainment media. So unlike Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible, Barbie offered a significant publicity opportunity. And who doesn’t want to make history?
Did the movie and its marketing represent something new for how Barbie presents women?
Although the film is a lot of fun, I left with mixed feelings. Mattel has always wanted moms to think of Barbie as a strong and inclusive role model, and the film reinforces those brand characteristics. But at her core, Barbie has been and will always be about materialism. She’s a fashion doll and Mattel releases a new line of Barbie products every six months that they really want you to buy. You buy Barbie new clothes, do her hair, dress her up. You play that she’s shopping with her friends. If your parents are rich, maybe she gets to live in the $179 house she dreams of. If your parents are woke, maybe she has a non-White, differently abled sidekick to go shopping with. But blonde, skinny, White, stereotypical Barbie will always be the star. Her feet will always be pointy, her waist will always be tiny, and she will always be about looking beautiful and having things. Don’t get me wrong; girls enjoy playing with Barbies this way. It’s fun. But it’s definitely not feminism.
Are there lessons for how brands can refresh other cultural products with a strong but possibly outdated image?
The Barbie one-two punch that some legacy brands could copy is to poke fun at themselves, then deliver a message that feels timely and relevant.
In the first half of the film, the audience is laughing at everything about Barbie world. Her silly feet, her airhead boyfriend Ken, his feeling so unnecessary (because he is). The filmmakers embrace the cringe, and we love them for it. After laughing at and along with Barbie, we become open-minded. Then America Ferrera nails the landing with her un-brainwashing speech, “It is literally impossible to be a woman.” We relate to everything she says. We wouldn’t have associated those ideas with Barbie (not at all!) but now we’re actually listening. Humor does that. Ferrera’s words work like a magic spell on the Barbies, waking them from the fog of patriarchy. The real magic it works is on us though, making us think Barbie might be kind of cool after all.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWdodHMuc29tLnlhbGUuZWR1L2luc2lnaHRzL3RoZS1zZWNyZXQtb2YtdGhlLWJhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZXMtbWFya2V0aW5nLXN1Y2Nlc3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Barbie movie: Warner Bros sorry for replying to atomic bomb memes,The Official Barbie Movie account is criticised for replying to images which made fun of atomic bombs.,"Barbie movie: Warner Bros sorry for replying to atomic bomb memes
By Mariko Oi Business reporter
Warner Bros
Warner Bros has apologised after an official Barbie Movie account replied to Barbenheimer memes featuring atom bomb images.
Some images showed Margot Robbie with a mushroom cloud hairstyle. The official Barbie movie account replied: ""This Ken is a stylist"".
Barbie is scheduled to be released on 11 August in Japan - five days after the 78th anniversary of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima.
Other meme images that enraged Japanese social media users include one showing Cillian Murphy, who played Robert Oppenheimer - known as the ""father of the atomic bomb"", carrying Ms Robbie on his shoulder through a burning city. The Barbie movie official account replied: ""It's going to be a summer to be remembered"".
In a statement posted on Warner Bros Japan's own Barbie account, the firm said it was ""extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie 'Barbie' reacted to the social media postings of 'Barbenheimer' fans.""

A day later, its US headquarters told the BBC: ""Warner Bros regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.""
Twitter, which has recently rebranded to X, has since added community notes to original posts to highlight the historical context of the atomic bomb attacks on Japan.

The devastated city of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb blast
The recorded death tolls are estimates, but it is thought that about 140,000 of Hiroshima's 350,000 population were killed in the blast on 6 August 1945. At least 74,000 people died when Nagasaki was bombed three days later.
The radiation released by the bombs caused thousands more people to die from radiation sickness in the years that followed.
One social media user posted: ""My grandfather was in Hiroshima until a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped. Among those who died under that mushroom cloud were many children who were at the age of playing with Barbie dolls.""

Here are the details.","In one of the most highly-anticipated movies of summer 2023, Barbie not only brings Barbieland to life, but it also features several incredible cameos. For one, America Ferrera’s real-life husband, Ryan Piers Williams, actually starred as her on-screen husband in the Warner Bros. Pictures film. The movie follows Barbie’s (played by Margot Robbie) journey into the real world, where she meets Ferrera’s character Gloria, an employee of Mattel toy company, and her teenage daughter, Sasha (played by Ariana Greenblatt). The mother and daughter partner with one another to help Barbie return to Barbieland.

While leaving the real world, Gloria wonders if her husband would care that she left and if he would be fine without her. Then, the movie shows Gloria’s spouse practicing Spanish, completely unaware that his wife and daughter are heading to a different dimension. It turns out that Gloria’s husband is actually Ferrera’s actual husband in real life.
At the end of the movie, Ferrera's husband also makes another appearance as her character Gloria's spouse. In the scene, Williams’ character is shown sitting in a car with Gloria, Sasha, and Barbie, attempting to tell Barbie in Spanish that he's proud of her. “Estoy orgullosa de ti,” he tells her. He also says, “Sí se puede,” which is a reference to Gotta Kick It Up!, Ferrera’s 2002 Disney Channel movie, according to Today.
Ferrera managed to keep her husband’s role in the movie a secret, but she gave subtle hints on social media. On July 13, 2023, Ferrera promoted Barbie by posting a photo with her husband posing on a pink carpet during the movie’s premiere. “My favorite & forever Ken, you cute💙🖤💕,” she wrote in her caption. Later, some fans picked up on the fact that the couple brought their real-life romance to the motion picture. “Your real husband played your movie husband?!” one fan asked. Another commented, “I loved his cameo role he was so funny 😂.” Williams uploaded a similar photo from the premiere along with a supportive message to his wife. “I can’t wait for you all to see America in this film! 🔥😍🔥 #barbieworld,” he said. Some of his friends and followers flocked to the comments section to share positive opinions on his role after watching the movie, which premiered on July 21, 2023. “Can't lie, a certain cameo was the highlight for me 😉😁,” one person wrote.
According to The Cut, director Greta Gerwig wrote Gloria’s part with partner Noah Baumbach after being a fan of Ugly Betty. In October 2022, Ferrera told People that her children, Sebastian Piers and Lucia Marisol, weren’t aware that their parents would be acting together in the box office recording-breaking film since they are five and three years old. “They don’t really have any context for it,” the actress explained. “So, one day [they might care], but not now. They’re still too young.”
Ferrera and Williams first met in 2005 while the actress was a student a the University of Southern California and a rising star in Hollywood. At the time, Williams cast Ferrera in his first short film called “Muertas.” They started dating shortly after, and five years later, Williams popped the question. The following year, the two of them tied the knot. Although the pair is proud parents to two children, they keep most of their family life off of social media.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYW1lcmljYS1mZXJyZXJhLWh1c2JhbmQtYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLWh1c2JhbmQtNzU2NTE1MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-12 22:00:00+00:00,He’s ‘just Ken’ but will the ‘Barbie’ movie change his popularity?,,"This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Ryan Gosling, left, and Margot Robbie in a scene from “Barbie.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)
NEW YORK (AP) — On and off the big screen, it’s Barbie’s world and Ken is just living in it.
As reflected in Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster movie that tackles the legacy Mattel’s famous doll, Barbie has always been more popular than Ken. For every Ken doll sold today, there’s generally eight to 10 Barbies sold, according to Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of review site of TTPM.
It’s unclear if Warner Bros’ “Barbie,” which was also co-produced by Mattel, will increase Ken production and sales. But Silver noted that the movie “gave Ken more attention than Ken has received” in decades.
Ken was first introduced back in 1961, two years after Barbie hit store shelves. But he hasn’t had nearly the same impact on the Barbieverse since.
“Barbie’s world is about Barbie. And (to some), Ken may be an accessory of sorts,” said Ed Timke, an assistant professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University, pointing to years of marketing that has, naturally, put Barbie at center stage.
The new attention around Ken following “Barbie’s” release has also received pushback. Many note that the movie is about Barbie — not Ken — and that’s where the spotlight should stay.
Still, the dynamic between the film’s Barbie and Ken may get people to reflect some big questions about gender as well as Ken’s own evolution over the years.
Who is Ken as a toy and how has he changed?
Ken’s relationship to Barbie has been up for debate since the two hit the toy aisle together. While Mattel long-advertised Ken as Barbie’s boyfriend — and even detailed their 2004 split and subsequent reconciliation seven years later — many also saw Ken as Barbie’s best friend, and sometimes queer icon. One 1993 version of Ken in particular, Earring Magic Ken, became notably popular among LGBTQ consumers, the New York Historical Society notes. At the time, Mattel denied the Earring Magic Ken was queer and later pulled him from shelves.
Other popular versions of Ken ranged from the tuxedo-wearing 1984 Dream Date Ken, to 1978 Superstar Ken and 1979 Sun Malibu Ken, which became one of the doll’s most iconic looks (as reflected in Ryan Gosling’s character). While Ken has gone through far fewer career changes than Barbie, his resume boasts job titles like astronaut, barista, country western singer and doctor.
“A wonderful thing is that through play, children are free to have their dolls take on any type of role that they wish,” said Ann Herzog, a clinical instructor of child life and family-centered care at Boston University.
She also underlined the importance of diversity in toy collections and providing “open-ended play opportunities and not to endorse stereotypes that the Barbie collection and dolls in general are only specific to a particular gender.”
While children of all genders, including young boys, have played with Barbie and Ken over the years, Timke notes that “there’s definitely the gendering of marketing toward girls” for both figures, pointing to contrasts in advertising for products historically seen as “boy toys,” such as G.I. Joe. That legacy, as well as other socialization, still impacts who plays with certain toys today.
Still, Ken — like Barbie — has evolved over time and become more diverse, particularly after Mattel rolled out more skin tones, body types, hairstyles and more for Ken dolls in 2017. Some Kens also have prosthetic legs, wheelchairs and hearing aids. Increases in diverse representation — with similar changes seen since 2016 for Barbie — has boosted the dolls’ popularity and comeback sales, Silver said.
Will Barbie (and Ken) sales increase following the movie’s release?
Mattel did not respond to The Associated Press’ requests for data or comment on specific Ken and Barbie sales seen before and after “Barbie’s” July 21 release. But according to market research firm Circana, Barbie sales overall for the U.S. toy industry increased 40% in the last two weeks of July compared with the same period in 2022.
Circana doesn’t break out Ken from Barbie sales. Still, “I suspect that, with the movie, sales of Ken dolls will experience a strong lift in sales,” Juli Lennett, VP, U.S. toys industry advisor at Circana, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Additional experts also expected a spike in interest, but weren’t sure about the long run.
Lennett did note that the top-selling “Barbie” movie item for those last two weeks of July was the Barbie Gingham Dress followed by the Ken Doll Set. Between those two items, Barbie outsold Ken nearly two to one, she said.
For the second quarter of 2023, which ended weeks before the movie’s release, worldwide sales of Barbie to retailers excluding adjustments actually fell 6%. Mattel executives told analysts that sales had improved in July, and it expects the movie will have a halo effect on the brand for years to come.
There was a carryover of inventory across the toy industry for the first half of the year, Silver explains, noting that record sales in the first years of the pandemic led to over-buying at the end of 2022. He predicts a rebound in Barbie sales heading into the holiday season, when toy spending is high and after “Barbie” eventually makes its way to streaming.
And of course, sales following “Barbie’s” release won’t be limited to the toy aisle. Other branded products are also gaining popularity from the film, including Ken-focused swag like “I am Kenough” sweatshirts and other “Ken-ergy” apparel, are currently for sale by Mattel, as well as from third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnQtdHJpYi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8xMi9oZXMtanVzdC1rZW4tYnV0LXdpbGwtdGhlLWJhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1jaGFuZ2UtaGlzLXBvcHVsYXJpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-07 15:37:43+00:00,‘Weird Barbie’ Inspired by Kate McKinnon in ‘Barbie’ Movie Is Now a Mattel Doll: Details and How to Buy,"Mattel has created a Barbie doll modeled after Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie in the 'Barbie' movie, which has grossed over $1 billion worldwide.","Weird Barbie from Greta Gerwig’s hit “Barbie” film has proven so popular that Mattel is now debuting an official Weird Barbie doll. The doll, played in the movie by Kate McKinnon, is supposed to reflect a Barbie doll that has been blemished and mishandled, and is no longer perfect.
McKinnon’s character in the film has unevenly chopped-off hair, and she wears a pink puff sleeve paint-splattered dress. In essence, Weird Barbie is a doll that’s been played with to the point of what some would consider destruction.
Mattel ’s Weird Barbie Mattel
Despite the doll being less than perfect in a land of glamorous and impeccably stylish Barbies (Margot Robbie, who plays the main Barbie, wore plenty of Chanel for the film), Weird Barbie became a breakout character in Gerwig’s successful movie.
Mattel’s Weird Barbie Mattel
The official Weird Barbie doll created by Mattel is completely modeled after McKinnon’s character. The doll was designed by Javier Meabe, Mattel’s lead product designer. Weird Barbie is a made-to-move posable doll that comes in collectible “Barbie the Movie” packaging. All dolls purchased come with a certificate of authenticity.
The price point for Weird Barbie is $50, and it is available for pre-order on Mattel’s website. The dolls are expected to ship on or before May 31, 2024.
In addition to Weird Barbie, Mattel has launched Barbie and Ken dolls inspired by looks from the film. A couple of the looks include Ken’s faux fur coat from when he turns Barbie’s Dreamhouse into the Mojo Dojo Casa House, and Barbie and Ken’s retro-inspired skating looks.
“Barbie” made history at the box office after grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, making it the first film solely directed by a woman to become a billion-dollar movie. According to NPR, of the 53 films that have broken the $1 billion mark, only nine, including “Barbie,” center around female protagonists.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9wb3AtY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLW5ld3Mvd2VpcmQtYmFyYmllLWRvbGwtbWF0dGVsLTEyMzU3NjI2NjUv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d2QuY29tL3BvcC1jdWx0dXJlL2N1bHR1cmUtbmV3cy93ZWlyZC1iYXJiaWUtZG9sbC1tYXR0ZWwtMTIzNTc2MjY2NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“I used to to float/ Now I just fall down/ I used to know, but I’m not sure now/ What I was made for/ What was I made for?,” Eilish sings in a breathy whisper over a gentle piano backing on the track co-written and produced by brother FINNEAS. “Takin’ a drive, I was an idea/ Looked so alive, turns out, I’m not real/ Just something you paid for/ What was I made for?”
The Oscar, Grammy and Golden Globe-winning singer directed the clip, in which she meticulously tries to arrange the Barbie clothes on a tiny rack in a green void as wind and rain whip them around to her frustration. “Cause I, I/ I don’t know how to feel/ But I wanna try/ I don’t know how to feel/ But someday I might/ someday I might,” she croons on the chorus.
According to a release, the “intimate and heart-rending track exists as the sonic background for pivotal scenes through-out the film, while beautifully and poignantly highlighting the film’s important message and sentiment.”
In a statement accompanying the video’s release, Eilish said director Greta Gerwig showed her and Finneas a handful of unfinished scenes in January, admitting that the sibling collaborators had, “nooooo idea what to expect at ALLL… we were so deeeeeply moved.. that the next day we were writing and COULDNT shut up about it lolll andddddddddd ended up writing almost the entire song that night. to be real with you this all seemed to happen in a time when i really needed it. i’m so so thankful for that.”
She added that the video she created for it, “makes me cryyyyy.. it means so much to me and i hope it will mean just as much to you. don’t have much to say other than that, i think it will speak for itself🫀 :’’’’) enjoy.”
The singer teased the emotional track earlier this week in a video in which a voice was heard telling Barbie (Margot Robbie), to “take my hand, close your eyes, now, feel,” backed by a gentle, melancholy piano and Eilish singing the title of the song. “absolutely over the MOOOOON excited for you to see this,” she captioned the post. Finneas and Eilish won the best original song Oscar in 2022 for their collaboration on the title track to the most recent James Bond film, No Time to Die.
The Mark Ronson-produced soundtrack for Gerwig’s candy-colored toy story will also feature contributions from Lizzo, Charli XCX, Karol G, Sam Smith, co-star Ryan Gosling (with Slash), Dominic Fike, Haim, the Kid LAROI, Khalid, PinkPantheress, Gayle, Ava Max, Fifty Fifty, Tame Impala and already released singles from Dua Lipa and Ice Spice with Nicki Minaj; the movie will hit theaters on July 21.

,Barbie movie soundtrack breaks UK singles chart record,"Dua Lipa, Lizzo, Nicki Minaj and Billie Eilish bring the Kenergy on the film's star-studded album.","Barbie movie soundtrack breaks UK singles chart record
By Francesca Osborne BBC Newsbeat
Warner Bros. Pictures
Come on Barbie, let's get charty: Even Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling can't resist a sing-along to the soundtrack
Barbie's already taken over the box office and now the film's soundtrack has conquered the UK music charts too.
Tracks by Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa and Nicki Minaj have stormed straight into the top five since the pink-tinged blockbuster's release one week ago.
And they weren't the only songs from the star-studded album to hit the chart.
Anywhere else he'd be a top 10, but Ryan Gosling brought some Kenergy at number 25 with his ballad I'm Just Ken.
Bosses of the Official Singles Chart say it's the first time three tracks from a soundtrack have reached the top five at the same time.
And they say it made history with a total of six tracks in the top 40:
What Was I Made For, Billie Eilish - number three
Dance The Night Away, Dua Lipa - number four
Barbie World, Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice - number five
Speed Drive, Charlie XCX - number 19
I'm Just Ken, Ryan Gosling - number 25
Pink, Lizzo - number 39
Some of pop's biggest names were behind the soundtrack's pink, sparkly hits, and you might think that recruiting such a glitzy line-up would be hard work.
But the film's music supervisor George Drakoulias tells BBC Newsbeat you'd be wrong.
""Nobody said no,"" he says. ""Everybody was really excited.""
That included two stars at the top of George's wish list, Nicki Minaj and Lizzo, along with superstar writer and producer Mark Ronson.
George says he enticed Mark on to the project with a simple text message: ""Hey Barbie?""
""He called me right back and we sent him a script,"" says George. ""That started the ball rolling.""
Mark ended up curating the soundtrack, writing the score and penning the film's closing song, Dance the Night Away, with Dua Lipa.

The soundtrack's also played a big part in Barbie's massive marketing campaign.
Songs from the 17-track album have been steadily released in the run-up to the film's release, which George says has ""helped fuel excitement for the movie"".
""It was a perfect symbiotic relationship of the music driving the movie and the movie driving the music,"" he says.
""Once you saw the movie and how well the music works, as soon as they left the theatre people went out and got the album.""
And, this being Barbie, physical copies of the soundtrack are available in ""cotton candy"" vinyl and on transparent pink cassette tapes.

Nicki Minaj collaborated with Ice Spice to release Barbie World, which has been streamed more than 42m times on YouTube
George refuses to reveal his favourite track but says he was ""blown away"" by Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For.
He says the singer was shown just 25 minutes of the film and managed to ""take what she'd seen and encapsulate it into this heartbreaking song of being a woman"".
George says he's very proud of the album and its success in the charts is ""the icing on the cake"".
""It's Barbie's world, we just live in it,"" he says.
Aqua's Barbie Girl, sampled in Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice's movie song, also returned to the chart for the first time since its original release in 1997.
And while plastic sure is fantastic, Dave and Central Cee kept the top spot, with Sprinter entering its eighth week at number one.
Olivia Rodrigo also sunk her teeth deeper into the number two slot, holding firm with Vampire.
As recently as 2018, The Greatest Showman soundtrack sold 2.1m copies in the UK, outpacing new releases by Drake and Ariana Grande.
But the idea of chart-topping artists working together on a blockbuster movie had largely fallen out of favour in the era of superhero franchises and cinematic universes.
Even before that, young adult movies like Twilight and Hunger Games were aligning themselves with credible alternative artists like Paramore, Iron & Wine and The National. Lorde even curated the (superb) music for Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Pt 1.
Over the last few years, there have been flickers of the traditional soundtrack album returning. OneRepublic's I Ain't Worried was a breakout hit from last year's Top Gun Maverick; and Post Malone & Swae Lee's Sunflower (from Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse) was a top three single in 2018.
But, just like the movie, the Barbie soundtrack is confounding expectations. The tracklist is like a who's who of modern pop - Lizzo, Ice Spice, PinkPantheress, Dua Lipa. Is this the beginning of a new era?

When the movie ended and I looked around, prepared to walk into the lobby and break down all my thoughts, I felt a pause, then got a little nervous—I didn't feel anything. I laughed so much (specifically from Ryan Gosling in himbo mode), but nothing was bursting to the top of my mind, nothing was fighting to get out and be unpacked. It was as if I had just seen nothing. I had simply experienced a hyperbolic void of chaos and color that I immediately forgot. Amnesia or literally waking up from a dream. What just happened?
This essay is a part of pop justice, Scalawag's newsletter exploring the intersection of popular culture and justice—namely through abolition. Sign up here.
The first thing I was able to mutter (after some gleeful shrieking at how much fun I had) was ""I just don't know what that meant."" My friend Maxwell said something along the lines of, ""I think it's just like telling you to breathe, stop for a minute, and know that you're okay. It's not that serious."" (cue Indigo Girls ""It's only life after all,"" one of the funniest song choices I've seen in a while.)
I liked this and agreed, but it made something tug at me even more. It couldn't have been so simple as to just beckon the audience to seek presence and relax, to see life like a child again, relishing in the joy and nonsense—there were too many layers and too much money packed into under (!!) two hours, swirling around impatiently in my brain.
As I slowly regained consciousness, the second thing I attempted to say was how the pump-up speech America Ferrera gave in an attempt to break the Barbies out of their Ken-washing made me physically uncomfortable. I couldn't get it out of my head. I thought, this can't be what famously off-kilter Gerwig envisioned as a catalyzing moment, a woman of color from the ""real world"" slapping stockpile first-wave-feminism-sentience onto a horde of patriarchy-ified Barbies? The writing was average, I'd heard it a million times from inspirational coffee mugs and presidential candidates. It felt randomly heightened among the 13 other plot lines and character arcs approaching but never meaningfully countering gender roles and realities. But then, to my absolute delight, it turned into a bit.
Rather than using Barbie lore to tackle questions of gender and feminism, the movie uses Barbie to talk about, well, Barbie. From Barbie's perspective. Whatever that means.
As Ferrara started spitting shorter, more rote cliff-note versions to all the Barbies one by one, the repetition and pacing of the montage began to carry this beautifully appropriate tiredness, utilitarianism, and repackage-ability that mirrors the ethos of Barbie™ itself. Her brilliant acting seamlessly carried this scene from stock footage to contemporary art. Rather than using Barbie lore to tackle questions of gender and feminism, the movie uses Barbie to talk about, well, Barbie. From Barbie's perspective. Whatever that means. At the very beginning of the movie, Helen Mirren slides in a comment about how Barbies think they solved all the problems of feminism, and suddenly we're all in on the plasticky reality of what these toys I suppose tried to represent.
The last thought I had during our sacred lobby-debrief-time was about how this was kind of like a documentary. Hear me out: if the Barbies and Kens had to go through a plot devised by Gerwig and Baumbauch, this is quite simply what would happen. It wouldn't really make sense because nothing in their world makes sense. It would be hysterically childish and naive, it would be darkly backwards and strange.
The natural next question might be, how do we even know what Barbies would act like? What research do you do to create their world? Isn't their life up to the owner, the person playing with them? To which the director said, yes and no. I will also remind you that this isn't an actually answerable question. There are no giant hands moving them around (as one Barbie comments, ""No, what? That would be weird!""), the line between human world and doll world is gloriously and strangely vague, and ultimately we just don't really know how it works. Even Weird Barbie, the wisest and most exiled in Barbieland, has all the answers but no explanations. No one really asks, either, because it's make-believe. And isn't that kinda how it felt as a kid?

Growing up, I played with Barbies at friends' houses and always had a blast, imagining how they'd inhabit their dream house and creating dialogues that came directly from my own hopes and dreams. But they weren't really my world. What I specifically loved most were Polly Pockets and Beanie Babies, and if I'm being brutally honest, they were more like gateway drugs into making elaborate houses out of cardboard, shoeboxes, random trinkets, paper, whatever I could get my hands on (we didn't have cable TV). Sometimes I'd spend all day making a house and then declare playtime over, never even touching the talent.
Today, at 29, I'm a practicing artist, designer, and filmmaker, and I often think about how these hours and hours of literal and figurative world-building as a child has affected my career today. Sometimes, when I'm on set for a film in the art department, I can't believe there are so many adults taking this seriously—it fills me with joy and wonder and bafflement, but some days just as easily slides into a more sinister version of surrealism when the reality of how much labor, time, money, and resources are poured into a production come to light.
I admittedly didn't think of any of the ongoing strikes while watching Barbie. The movie makes it almost impossible to think about anything else—a hypnosis of capitalism, genuinely nostalgic yet totally jarring in its lifelessness. But in the days after, reality crept back in: the hypocritical inequities of the entertainment industry sit right under this near-perfect representation of a parallel universe. Though it's no secret to people in the film industry that make-believe is actually quite serious, a literal livelihood that pays the bills and suffers with the ebbs and flows of media trends just like any other industry. The strikes are bringing to light something that has long been underplayed: the irony of entertainment's astronomical public value compared to the vast undervaluing of its creators.
Making art under capitalism is a challenge that's almost insurmountable for this reason. For many, you either make it big enough to be at the top of the dog pile (which the Barbie production designers have arguably done), or you struggle forever and get great at readjusting. Other options include overwork, never sleeping, and credit card debt. I enjoy all three.
What does it mean that our immediate response to a line of toys that tried to represent women as powerful is ""that's dumb""?
And still, sitting in that theater, I was transported. Visually, Barbie gives us this amazing opportunity to hang out in some of the most fabulously bizarre details I've ever seen. The slow motion wild horses on LED screens floating around in every room of Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House, all the Kens perfectly pantomiming Matchbox 20 in a perfectly blue-hued plastic bonfire circle, the infamous first time Barbie takes off her shoes. If anything, the attention to detail and the willingness to embrace absurdity is what made the movie worthwhile, an extremely realistic reproduction of the adorable insanity that inhabits a child's mind.
But, it's still Barbie. In almost direct contrast to this bold and effervescent testament to imagination, the other thing that felt so concrete in the director's world-building was the decision that Barbies and Barbie World are just kinda dumb. Or maybe the word is naive—which feels way more eerie than ""dumb,"" because it's a complex emotion, one held by humans. The fact that this seems like an obvious choice when characterizing Barbie is interesting. What does it mean that our immediate response to a line of toys that tried to represent women as powerful is ""that's dumb""? Is that more telling of us as a society, how we see children and toys in general, or Mattel as a corporation? Probably all of the above.
In the movie, the Barbies are smarter and generally better than the Kens, which feels fun and true to the brand, but then we quickly see the boardroom of idiotic men who created them for sort of indiscernible reasons (read, money). One of the strongest moments in which we see the director's voice is when, in the end, Will Ferrell and his cronies don't actually totally control Barbie. Or, well, they don't control one specific Barbie. Let's not get confused: they still hold most of the power.
Another comment my friend Hannah made stuck with me: why does the movie have to have a point? She had just seen Asteroid City the week before and was freshly loaded with bright-eyed clarity about how we simply let that man (Wes Anderson) do whatever he wants. We suddenly understand that art doesn't have to have a point if it's a white man prancing around making weird allusions to other cultures. I think there's a lot of richness to Barbie, intentional or not. But also, it's just kind of like swimming around in batshit land while giving the art department the challenge of a lifetime in under (!!!!) two hours. And I loved that.

Elena Kiejliches, who was featured on Snapped in 2004, reveals how her story was twisted to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about women's violence.
Of course, the writers could have made this a movie explicitly about childhood and imagination, weaving an emotional tale about growing up, ignoring the negative effects of her reign, but they decided to make it about the product, not the humans who loved it. This is what made it unique in my mind—deciding the movie would be for Barbie, from Barbie, to Barbie is objectively pretty hilarious, especially when the genuine think pieces about its humanness start rolling in. Writing a movie like this is quite a feat. Kens turning into evil hyper-masc assholes? Not a biting, ""gotcha"" commentary on society as much as it is something that I guess Ken would probably do if given the chance. Which, of course, still becomes a commentary on the society that created Ken, because Ken is not sentient. But the circuitousness it takes to get there is delightful, a dadaist move to confront the genuine horrors of our world with intense absurdity.
This is not a sweeping biopic of a beloved figure, but it's clear that we want it to be. So many articles following its release seem upset that we didn't get some life lesson or awe-inspiring commentary on the human experience. Even the ones that go the other direction and praise the movie for marking the rise of ""bimbo-feminism"" or encouraging a more laissez-faire approach to what being a woman should ""mean"" feel like they're missing the point—Barbie is (obviously) still a hyper-skinny, cis, white woman with unbelievably damaging beauty standards (as was incredibly played out by her first interaction with Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). A slightly diversified cast of friends won't change that.
Something else that felt wholly undeniable about the movie was its whiteness. And not just in a make-Issa-Rae-president-but-only-give-her-two-lines kind of way, but in a more horrifying way, as if we were witnessing Ken himself as the origin story of our patriarchal white supremacist society while laughing along. And that actually was his arc—plus some pretty funny half-assed redemption attempts at the end. We laughed because it was openly foolish, because when we see our lives acted out by toys with limited vocabulary and reason, we can't make up excuses for the core of our evil.
What would it feel like to suddenly have Barbie be a genuine champion of equality in any sense? (see: gaslighting, Hamilton) Why would Baumbach and Gerwig rewrite the story of Mattel's impact for free? (or for money…) The final scene was brilliant—everything is back to normal in both worlds, and Barbie is just excited about something new about herself. And some new friends. Yay!
There are a million things to say about what we ruthlessly demand from our content and its creators, but at the end of the day, the Barbie movie is a giddy and harsh reminder of what this monolith of a brand really did—a lot of bullshit, nothing real, and yes, of course, lots of genuine happiness and wonder.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc2NhbGF3YWdtYWdhemluZS5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNy9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbm90aGluZy1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Barbie movie phenomenon is coming to the UAE after a monthlong delay,"It has completed ""necessary procedures in line with the standards of media content and the UAE age classification.""","The United Arab Emirates has approved the release of the “Barbie” movie after a delay of over a month over possible content issues.
UAE officials didn’t explain the screening delay, which has also occurred in other Arab nations.
“The UAE Media Council has granted the Barbie movie the approval to be screened in the UAE’s licensed cinemas after completing the necessary procedures in line with the standards of media content and the UAE age classification,” the council announced late Thursday.
The movie’s inclusion of a transgender actress as Barbie and other messaging on LGBTQ+ issues could be an issue in Arab countries with Muslim majorities that consider homosexuality and transgender identity to be contrary to Islamic religious beliefs.
The movie about the world-famous doll stars Margot Robbie in the titular role and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It also features several other actors as “Barbies” and “Kens,” including Hari Nef, a transgender actress from Philadelphia, who plays one of the Barbies.
Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. declined a request for comment. Majid Al Futtaim, the distributor of Warner Bros. movies in the Middle East, could not be reached for comment.

2023-08-15 13:32:29.665000+00:00,Margot Robbie Is Making a Ton of Money From Barbie,"As star and producer of the smash-hit film, Robbie will reportedly make roughly $50 million, between salary and box office bonuses.","Margot Robbie might be looking to buy a brand-new Malibu dream house, and then some. According to Variety, Robbie stands to make approximately $50 million on Barbie, between her salary and box office bonuses in her dual role as star and producer.
Robbie’s massive payday is due to the incredible success of the film, which got off to a smashing start as one half of the “Barbenheimer” craze. To date, Barbie has earned $526.4 million at the domestic box office and $660.6 million at the international box office for a grand total of roughly $1.19 billion globally, and it’s still going. Over the weekend, Barbie became the second-highest-grossing film in Warner Bros. history, just behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011), which made approximately $1.3 billion worldwide. It’s also officially made Greta Gerwig the highest-grossing female director of all time, surpassing the codirector of Frozen II, Jennifer Lee.
On top of starring in Barbie, Robbie’s production company, LuckyChap, which she founded in 2014 with Josey McNamara, Sophia Kerr, and her husband, Tom Ackerley, produced the film, so Robbie stands to make a killing on box office bonuses as well. Robbie was hands-on as a producer, rescuing the project from almost 10 years of developmental hell by re-pitching it to studios. In her pitch, Robbie noted that Barbie had the potential to be a big success, saying that the film could make $1 billion. “I think I told them that it’d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?!” said Robbie in an interview with Collider.
Barbie also adds another feather to Robbie’s cap as an actor, which includes celebrated turns in films like The Wolf of Wall Street, Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, and an Oscar nomination for I, Tonya. As a producer, Robbie’s LuckyChap has been behind Birds of Prey, Netflix’s Maid, and the Oscar-winning Promising Young Woman. Just last year, some folks on the internet considered Robbie “box office poison” due to her leading roles in two back-to-back flops, David O. Russell’s Amsterdam and Damien Chazelle’s Babylon. Clearly, they had no idea what Robbie and Barbie were capable of.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA4L21hcmdvdC1yb2JiaWUtaXMtbWFraW5nLWEtdG9uLW9mLW1vbmV5LWZyb20tYmFyYmll0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-12 07:00:00-04:00,Barbie movie 2023: Why is everyone hyped for Barbie?,A Barbie aficionado and certified doll expert explains why life in plastic has suddenly become so fantastic.,"This summer belongs to Barbie. Thanks to the Margot Robbie-led movie and the inescapable marketing surrounding it, Mattel’s 64-year-old doll has once again become America’s sweetheart. Everyone wants a Barbie. Everyone wants to be a Barbie. And everyone wants to go see Barbie — the movie made $337 million worldwide in its opening weekend.
When did life in plastic become so fantastic? And further: Is this love for Barbie something that’s always existed? Is it just brilliant marketing? Why Barbie and why now?
Barbie’s big moment is one of those rare things that feels both like a fiery overnight phenomenon and a long-simmering success. To better understand Barbie culture, Barbie’s history, and what we mean when we talk about Barbie, I spoke to Maria Teresa Hart, a Barbie expert and author of Doll, which she describes as a “non-fiction pop-culture feminist critique of dolls, doll history, and doll culture.”
Loving Barbie, she explains, isn’t as simple as it seems.
I want to get your vibe on this movie. Are you excited for it?
I am elated about this movie. Which might be a little bit of a surprise because in my book I do have criticisms. I’m sort of like a mother that wags her finger at a beloved child — in this case Barbie — being like, you could do better, you know? But I do love Barbie. My criticism is an act of love.
Does the fanfare surrounding the movie surprise you?
I mean, it’s this moment where you recognize that you’re not alone — there’s so many other people that are just desperate to get back into their toy box and want to relive their moments they had in their childhood bedroom. You know, walking Barbie up and down the plastic stairs and having her jump into the Corvette and drive off into the sunset.
There’s an entire wave of people that have grown up with this toy that feel this attachment and want to have this giddy moment. I see people planning their outfits or, what you saw last summer which you’re seeing again, which is the Barbie-core stuff coming — not just the clothes, but also the interiors, and really anywhere where you can have that moment of exuberant girliness.
When I’ve been on book tour, there are people that will come up to me and they’ll tell me their favorite Barbie. It’s almost like they’re telling you what their sign is astrologically. Like, when they say, “I was a Peaches ’n Cream Barbie,” “I was a Day-to-Night Barbie,” they’re giving you their personality. They’re giving you this, like, key piece of themselves. They still identify that way as an adult.
I want to stop you there. What kind of Barbie are you?
I’m very much a Day-to-Night Barbie, I guess. I’m a working gal. But that doesn’t really suit my fantasy because I would prefer to be something a little more glamorous, more frivolous, you know?
Wait. Back up. What is the Day-to-Night Barbie? Is it just a Barbie that has a job and then goes out?
No, she’s actually better. She is a Barbie that wears a little pink suit, and the outfit is reversible. You know how a mullet is business in the front and party in the back? That was her. Her pink business suit — you would essentially reverse it. You take off the jacket and turn the suit skirt into this party skirt, and she’d be ready for a night on the town.
Does Day-to-Night Barbie like espresso martinis?
I don’t think she did, but I’m pretty sure she came with a giant brick of a cellphone and a little plastic business briefcase. Funnily enough, she also had a kind of boater hat that had a ribbon around it, which is very strange. I don’t know what kind of business Barbie was supposed to be in, but apparently that’s what Mattel thought businesswomen were wearing to the office.
Oooh. On that note — I wanted to ask you about criticism. I’m an old millennial, and I think when you see this excitement toward Barbie, it feels a little weird because, in my adult life, I think I’ve seen several different iterations of Barbie and Mattel criticized for being sexist.
Like, I remember multiple stories about how Barbie’s proportions are actually anatomically impossible.
In the ’70s, there was a protest of the New York Toy Fair, where people were protesting, in part, against Barbie and how sexist she was. It’s like what you said, there’s historically been a wave of articles critiquing her body and calling out these unrealistic proportions and the expectations they put on young girls.
Those critiques weren’t necessarily wrong.
Not at all. Barbies in the early days really doubled down on both unrealistic beauty standards and on diet culture. One of them was Slumber Party Barbie. I believe she came with a scale and had these little diet books with the “diet advice” in them that was like, “Don’t eat.”
That was the advice!
Oh my god.
Right, it’s really damaging and damning stuff to put into a little girl’s head. The scales were set to a certain number, I think it was like 110 or something like that. The point is these toys were like an instruction manual, and you’re giving them to a little girl saying, “Do this.” And with these toys, you’re really starting them down this lifetime path of potential body dysmorphia and issues with weight. Barbie is definitely complicit in that historically, and I think we have to remember that Barbie, she has all these incredible careers now — but her very first career was teen model.
Everyone needs a first job!
So like, the very early history of Barbie is that she was a cartoon in a saucy German tabloid, called Bild Lilli. That character was very much for the male gaze. She was created for men. The original prototype was a novelty toy that was sold in gag gift shops for bachelors. She came with all of that baggage, but then her world, the world that she exists in, is where so much of what we consider patriarchal norms gets subverted. So this is very much a world where women are centered, their needs are centered, their aesthetics are centered. And it is about kind of entering this fantasy world where a lot of patriarchal norms are completely reversed.
Right, like the Barbie paradox. She’s capable of everything in her world — even if that world hasn’t always been a “great” place.
In your book, you mention that Barbie’s world is a utopia or a fantasy, and on the one hand, it’s great. But on the other hand, the woman who gets to experience that power fantasy has to be a beautiful, blonde, skinny woman.
I think Barbie represents the pinnacle of womanhood and an achievement of that — and so she’s always going to be a mixed bag. We can think about supermodels or you know, young A-list starlets that are walking the red carpet or what have you. They are existing within the patriarchy and they are reflecting some of those values the Barbie does too.
I do mention this in one of my chapters, but there are women who take that as 100% prescriptive and they think, “If I can achieve this ideal, then doors will open for me.” And so it becomes this goal that they’re trying to attain through plastic surgery, through extreme dieting, through whatever means in order to have access to the things that Barbie portrays. And it’s not necessarily wrong, because we know that we live in a society that is patriarchy-based and is shaped with those issues.
Obviously, I don’t think Slumber Party Barbie and her scale are making the cut in Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie. I want to ask you where you think this all turned. Like everyone seems genuinely excited about this movie. How do we go from “Barbie is problematic” to now?
I know for me, it turned out quite some time ago. I think I came to a place in kind of my own feminist journey where I was embracing a lot of the things that I had rejected.
I think that there’s been this feminist adjustment that’s been happening for some time. I see my own femininity and hyper-femininity as things that shouldn’t be villainized, or things that should be considered like a tool of the patriarchy.
They are genuine aspects of myself and my own joy.
And you know ... oh, here we go [sighs].
Hahaha. Go on!
Okay, so there was this meme years ago going around. It’s this classroom of young girls that were having their photo taken, and it might have been costume day because they were all dressed like princesses. And then there’s one little girl that was dressed as Darth Vader. And then the caption was something like, “Be the Darth Vader you wish to see in the world or something like that.”
It was like, let’s reject princess culture as being foolish and silly and like, and embrace the fact that, you know, this one little girl was being a rebel and was dressing up as Darth Vader. It was very cute!
Was it “cute” though?
Hahaha! Right? At the same time, I was like, this feels like corporate feminism. It was like, “Hey, instead of being a girly girl, why don’t you be a person that owns an evil empire?”
Like, that’s the message. Instead of dressing up in pink and a bunch of bows, what if you ran a completely horrible corporation? This current moment that we’re living in now, I think we’ve been looking back, saying we’re wrong about these things, and reevaluating.
I think it’s also if you’re gonna go back to that meme, I think the whole binary of like, running an evil empire or being a princess, I think the Barbie line would now be like, “Why can’t I do both?”
Be the princess that runs an empire!
The Barbie tagline would be “This Barbie runs an evil empire!”
Absolutely. It totally would. She would get her own poster!
It’s funny that we’re talking about death and destruction because Barbie is going up against Oppenheimer, which is probably the most guy-coded movie this summer — a movie about mass death and destruction. And the way the two movies have been positioned seem like diametric opposites.
I love it.
Barbie is the type of movie that I think gets overlooked. Like it’s not created to be Oscar bait. That’s very much an Oppenheimer thing — you know, vehicles that are this hyper-masculine, very tortured, and have a dark and sinister type of vibe to it. That appeals to Oscar voters.
And Barbie is one of those things where the more feminine something is, the more discredited it can be. Barbie feels like the underdog. So the movie and its press tour have been this message that “Hey femininity matters too and this is also worth your attention, your awards, and your rave reviews.”
Thematically, Barbie vs. Oppenheimer also feels like opposing forces. Barbie seems to be about creation, imagination, and finding a new world, and Oppenheimer is about massive destruction.
I still have my criticisms of Barbie. I know she exists in this gray space. But I think with Barbie, I hope it acknowledges she has this exuberance, this feminine joy that comes with her. I don’t want to diminish that by saying yes, okay, there can be improvements that are made, there are things that Barbie gets wrong, very wrong and historically extremely wrong.
But there’s also a freedom that comes with Barbie.
If Barbie can be anything, why not let her be everything? That’s sort of beautiful.
There’s freedom to be able to throw on the sequins and the marabou feathers. To saying here I am, and like feeling that Barbie’s world is something that’s made for this — to validate and to amplify this feminine energy.

2023-11-27 16:41:00+00:00,Will There Be a Barbie Sequel?,"""It could go a million different directions,"" star Margot Robbie said of a possible second Barbie movie.","Will Barbie come back for a second movie?
Writer and director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie haven't ruled it out, but Robbie doesn't seem to think there's a possibility. ""We put everything into this one. We didn’t build it to be a trilogy,"" she told the Associated Press. ""Greta put everything into this movie, so I can’t imagine what would be next.""
Months ago, at the Los Angeles premiere, Gerwig replied to a question about a sequel, or a Ken-focused spin-off, saying, ""Honestly, I'm just focused on getting this one out and crossing all my fingers and toes. And then we'll see what happens after that.""
In another interview with the New York Times, Gerwig said, ""At this moment, it's all I've got. I feel like that at the end of every movie, like I'll never have another idea and everything I've ever wanted to do, I did. I wouldn't want to squash anybody else's dream but for me, at this moment, I'm at totally zero."" Ryan Gosling, who played Ken, would be open to returning. ""I would work with Greta and Margot on anything,"" he said at the premiere.
As the Barbenheimer (Barbie plus Oppenheimer) phenomenon occured this summer, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy said he would play a Ken in a Barbie sequel. ""Would I play a Ken in Barbie 2? Sure,"" Murphy told Cinéfilos. ""Let's read the script and let's have a conversation."" Emily Blunt, another Oppenheimer star, also said she'd love to do it (if it exists). ""Yes, PLEASE! I'd do anything with Greta Gerwig!"" she said during an interview.
While Murphy was never slated to appear in Barbie, there were other actors who almost appeared in the film, like Bowen Yang, Dan Levy, and Ben Platt. ""They were, I'm not kidding, really bummed they couldn't do it,"" one of Barbie's casting directors, Allison Jones, told Vanity Fair. Perhaps a Barbie sequel could feature all these Kens?

2023-07-06 13:52:14+00:00,Mark Ronson Breaks Down the 'Barbie' Soundtrack,Producer Mark Ronson breaks down the process of bringing together a glittery group of artists and nailing the sound to accompany the iconic doll.,"If you’ve spent even 10 minutes online in the past few months, then you’ve seen the excitement for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken (in addition to a bunch more Barbies and Kens). While much of the anticipation stems from curiosity about Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach’s handling of a doll with a long, controversial history, there has also been plenty of buzz around the movie’s star-studded soundtrack. Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, and Karol G are just a few of the high-profile artists featured on the album, which is executive produced by the superproducer Mark Ronson.
Ronson has spent the past couple of decades working with many of the biggest names in music, including Lady Gaga, Adele, Paul McCartney, Dua Lipa, Christina Aguilera, and Amy Winehouse. But his last year has been focused on all things pink and glittery. He tells TIME that his Barbie journey began when he got a text from George Drakoulias, a music supervisor who has worked with Baumbach in the past, telling him that Gerwig and Baumbach were working on a Barbie film. Ronson jumped at the opportunity and took a call with them as they were prepping for production in England.
“Those two make some of my favorite films,” he says. “I thought, ‘Even if I don’t get this gig, I know this is going to be my favorite movie next year.’” So he signed on to do the project, and he and Gerwig hit the ground running: “I became the Robin to her Batman,” he says.

Finding just the right collaborators, from Nicki Minaj to Karol G

First they had to nail down the voices that would populate the project. Gerwig sent Ronson a playlist of music she loves, including songs from Xanadu and Andrea True Connection, as well as what he says could be described as “guilty pleasure music” or “Peloton pop.” The duo made a “dream list” of artists they wanted to be on the album, which included “obvious” choices like Nicki Minaj (who has consistently called herself a Barbie since her breakout mixtape hit, “Itty Bitty Piggy” and whose fans are known as the Barbz), and Charli XCX, known for her hyper-feminine, hyper-pop aesthetic.
The overall sound they settled on is a balance of tongue-in-cheek girl power and pop anthems, alongside heartfelt, wistful tunes like HAIM’s “Home” and Tame Impala’s “Journey to the Real World.” Ronson says that those vibes were juxtaposed organically: every artist saw the scene they were going to write for and approached the songs with their own distinct style of music.
Gerwig and Ronson showed artists about 20 minutes of the film to give them a sense of its tone and narrative and told each one where they envisioned their song falling in the story. As they started talking with the musicians, they also realized that each one had meaningful relationships with the doll herself. “Karol G was instantly telling us how much Barbie meant to her,” he says. The HAIM sisters, who called themselves “Barbie specialists,” told him about growing up in the ‘90s and being allowed only one VHS tape: a Barbie film with “cheesy songs.” “I thought everyone was here because Greta Gerwig is making this awesome movie, and there’s been all this buzz around it,” Ronson tells TIME. But he saw that in addition to the filmmaker’s reputation, Barbie herself was a significant draw. “This [film] was really important to a lot of people.

Nailing the sound: from the rise and fall of disco to the depths of Ken’s soul
The first two songs made for the movie were Dua Lipa’s shimmering disco-pop number, “Dance the Night,” and Gosling’s ‘80s power ballad, “I’m Just Ken.” When conceiving the album, Ronson says he saw parallels between Barbie and the rise and fall of disco (along with its numerous resurrections). He watched the 2020 HBO documentary The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, which featured a scene about Disco Demolition Night in 1979 in Chicago, which marked the end of the genre’s popularity. “You just see the Bee Gees so crestfallen and thinking, ‘Wait, why does everyone hate us so much?’ Which is such a strong parallel to Barbie,” Ronson says, referring to the backlash the doll has received around her unrealistic proportions, among other things. “In the film, she just wants to make everybody happy and can’t understand why she’s so problematic or why people hate her.”
This sense of a “naive wanting to bring pleasure to the world” became a touchstone for the album. That quality can also be seen in the story of Ken, who is distinctively a himbo—a sweet, well-meaning man who might not always be the brightest. Barbie is the subject of his desire, but the feeling isn’t always mutual. Ronson knew that Gosling was the perfect Ken, and the song for the character just sort of popped into his head. “I went into the studio one day, and I got the idea for the line, ‘I’m just Ken, anywhere else I’d be a 10,’ and I thought: ‘That’s his whole life.’”
Ronson recorded a demo of the song and sent it to Gerwig, who played it for Gosling. The actor responded that it spoke to him “deeply.” Ronson’s musical partner Andrew Wyatt wrote the rest of the verses, and Ronson flew out to London to record the vocals with Gosling. “I wasn’t sure how much to push him and what he’s quite capable of,” he tells TIME. (Fans of the actor will remember that he began his career in the Mickey Mouse Club, and memorably sang in Blue Valentine and, more recently, La La Land.) “Then, as we started going, he started to warm up. He was just nailing it because he’s such an amazing actor. I hadn’t also figured that, of course, he would sell this song better than anyone because he is Ken.”

The “fever dream” of Ice Spice, Nicki, and the musical stylings of Aqua
It was always a priority to find a way to incorporate one of the most famous musical references to the doll, Aqua’s 1997 hit “Barbie Girl.” The song had been no. 1 in 10 countries after it was released, but it had also became the subject of a lawsuit, when Mattel sued MCA Records claiming that the song’s suggestive lyrics diminished the doll’s reputation. (The judge ruled in favor of MCA, saying the song was a parody and protected under the First Amendment, writing in his opinion that “parties are advised to chill.”)
When thinking through how to include the song on the soundtrack, Ronson says they decided to give it to the “most exciting new thing in music”: Ice Spice. At this point in the process, it was shortly after her song “Munch (Feelin’ U)” had become a viral sensation. They asked Ice’s producer, RIOTUSA, to rework “Barbie Girl” into a drill and Jersey-house-infused track, but after the instrumental was ready, Ronson and Gerwig had trouble pinning the artist down to show her the movie due to her non-stop travel schedule.
On the evening when they were supposed to meet at his studio, at 9 p.m., Ronson waited until 11:30 and still hadn’t heard anything. “I always turn my phone off before I go to bed so I can sleep stress-free, but for some reason, I turned it back on,” he recalls. Ice’s manager texted him to say that they were en route to the studio, so Ronson changed out of his pajamas and biked over to meet with them. (The meeting, of course, went well.) Ronson struck out in trying to get to Minaj on his own. But because of Ice and Minaj’s blossoming relationship, the beat made its way to Minaj and she agreed to hop on the track. “That,” says Ronson, “is how we got this fever dream of an incredible song.”

More surprises to come
The soundtrack features an array of songs that are as brief as they are catchy. Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive” is under two minutes, and the same goes for Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj’s track. Karol G’s “WATATI” is a little over two and a half minutes, while PinkPanthress keeps her song (like all of her music) hovering at around the two-minute mark. Ronson says the brevity isn’t necessarily intentional. “I think that’s just the way pop music is changing,” he says. “Pop is getting so short.”
The soundtrack announcement says that there are “more to Barbies and Kens to be announced,” and Ronson tells TIME that two songs have yet to be publicized. “One of the artists is obviously one of the f-cking greatest living artists around but also had a very personal, idiosyncratic tie to Barbie as well,” he says. When asked what it means that superstar Billie Eilish posted a neon pink Barbie sign on her Instagram account, he demurs and asks for our next question. (On July 6, Eilish confirmed in an Instagram post that she recorded a song, “What Was I Made For,” for the soundtrack.) With the movie set to hit theaters on July 21, we’ll have the rest of our answers soon enough.

,"‘Barbie’ Makes History, Becoming First Billion-Dollar Movie Directed Solely by a Woman",Greta Gerwig's movie challenges dated notions about the box-office appeal of films centered on women,"For 64 years, Barbie has been breaking glass ceilings—sometimes even surpassing career milestones before real women. In 1965, for example, she became an astronaut, 13 years before NASA allowed women in its astronaut corps and 18 years before Sally Ride became the first American woman to go to space, as Smithsonian magazine’s Sonja Anderson writes.
Now, the doll has helped a real woman hit an industry milestone: The blockbuster Barbie movie earned $1 billion after just 17 days, making Greta Gerwig the first woman to have a sole directing credit on a billion-dollar film. (She also scored the biggest ever opening weekend for a woman director, according to CBS News.)
Barbie reached $1 billion faster than any other Warner Bros. movie, beating Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) by two days, as Jeff Goldstein, the studio’s president of domestic distribution, tells the New York Times’ Brooks Barnes.
“As distribution chiefs, we’re not often rendered speechless by a film’s performance, but Barbillion has blown even our most optimistic predictions out of the water,” say Goldstein and Andrew Cripps, Warner Bros.’ president of international distribution, in a statement.
Gerwig’s film is also one of the only billion-dollar movies featuring female protagonists. Of the 53 movies that have reached the threshold (not adjusted for inflation), only nine center women and girls, according to NPR’s Neda Ulaby. Nearly half of those are animated children’s movies—including Finding Dory, which features a main character who is a female fish.
Barbie’s success “disproved a stubborn Hollywood myth that ‘girl’ movies—films made by women, starring women and aimed at women—are limited in their appeal,” writes the Times. “An old movie industry maxim holds that women will go to a ‘guy’ movie but not vice versa.”
The movie owes some of its initial success to a pink-heavy marketing campaign and its same-day opening with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which sparked the “Barbenheimer” cultural phenomenon. Since its debut, however, the film has impressed both audiences and critics with its self-aware social commentary. “Driving [the] discourse is the film’s embrace of what generations of women have both loved and hated about the [Barbie] brand and what it’s often represented in the past,” BoxOffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins tells CNN’s Eva Rothenberg.
Ana-Christina Ramón, co-author of annual surveys of diversity in Hollywood hiring published by the University of California, Los Angeles, tells the Times that the lack of women in leadership roles among Hollywood studios exacerbates the undervaluation of women-centered movies.
“If ever there was an example of why Hollywood needs more women in positions of power,” she adds, “this was it.”

2023-07-20 21:32:20+00:00,Barbie movie: Ryan Gosling’s Ken is the culmination of a career-long obsession.,The actor’s performance as Ken is the culmination of a career-long obsession.,"It’s not easy being the ideal woman’s ideal man. In Barbieland, where the winding, styrofoam-pebbled road of Barbie begins, women are perfect and all-powerful. They are presidents and physicists, all nine members of the Supreme Court, and every face on Mount Rushmore. It’s a world, Helen Mirren’s narrator informs us, where “women can be anything” and “all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.”
Good news for Barbie, but not so much for Ken. The Barbies’ Kens—they are all named Ken, just as all the Barbies are named Barbie—are sculpted Adonises with perfect hair and washboard abs, but they don’t serve any real function. Where the Barbies are individuated by their professions—Lawyer Barbie, Diplomat Barbie—the Kens are simply Ken. The closest that Ryan Gosling’s Ken, the designated mate to Margot Robbie’s Barbie, can come to defining his job is “beach”—not lifeguard, he explains, “which is a common misconception.” His real purpose is just to be, looking handsome and being nearby on the off chance that a Barbie needs something.
Barbies and Kens alike are under the impression that their matriarchal utopia is a mirror of the real world; surely, decades of playing with highly accomplished dolls must have overcome whatever biases existed in darker pre-Mattel times. But when Barbie and Ken make their way to Los Angeles in an attempt to track down the source of a disturbance in Barbieland’s perpetual bliss, they find themselves in a place that’s far less progressive, and far less pink, than their own. Barbie gets catcalled on the street and discovers that the company marketing her girl-power brand is run by an all-male board. But Ken discovers something different: a world where men hold power, where they are noticed and admired—a place where men matter.

Ken is the closest thing Barbie has to a villain, unless you count patriarchy itself. Upon returning to Barbieland, he and the other Kens (others Ken?) take control in a bloodless coup, and by the time Barbie makes her way back, she’s been literally displaced. Her dream home is now Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House, and the Barbies who once ruled the world wear frilly maid outfits and serve cocktails. But Gosling doesn’t play Ken as a bad guy, just a boy in a world where every night is girls’ night. He doesn’t really understand how patriarchy works—except that it seems to involve horses somehow?—but he knows the feeling of only existing in relation to someone else. “I don’t know who I am without you,” he says to Barbie, with a plaintive simplicity that’s almost heartbreaking. “It’s ‘Barbie and Ken.’ There is no ‘just Ken.’ ”

If, as director and co-writer Greta Gerwig has strongly implied, Barbieland is Barbie’s Eden, then Ken is its Eve, created from Barbie’s plastic rib as her loyal companion. It’s a role that Gosling has extended to the movie’s press tour (at least, before it was curtailed by the Screen Actors Guild strike). As Gerwig and Robbie dig into the movie’s subtext and shore up its feminist bona fides, Gosling has played the good-natured dope, leading some to worry—or hope—that he’s wedded to the Ken persona as permanently as Austin Butler was to Elvis Presley’s voice. A lot of male actors, especially of a certain age (Gosling is 42), would devote the media cycle around a movie built on gags about their character’s inadequacy to reestablishing their own dominance, the way straight men used to soak up accolades for playing gay roles while seizing every opportunity to drop a mention of their girlfriends. But Gosling seems to be having the time of his life embodying a genial beta male. “I went on the ride and I’m still going on it,” he told the New York Times. “I don’t want to leave the park. They are kicking me out. ‘The park is closing, sir.’ But I ordered churros and they are coming, I swear.” (He’s even the consummate Wife Guy, posing for red-carpet photos with his wife’s first initial—in the Barbie font, of course—on a chain around his neck.)

Although one of his first leading roles was as the young Hercules, Gosling has spent much of his career complicating masculine archetypes, whether by undermining them or taking them to their hyperbolic and self-immolating extremes. His unnamed wheelman in Drive is the embodiment of cool, stoic, and silent as he slips past the police in a satin scorpion jacket. But his machismo is embryonic, not triumphant: In the light of day, and minus his sunglasses, his face is open and unlined, like a child’s. (Ken has his own pair of shades, which, Gosling explains, he uses to hide his sadness.) In The Nice Guys, he’s a private investigator in Los Angeles, but instead of a hard-boiled gumshoe, he’s a hapless flailer who has to resort to having his tween daughter drive him around town after a real tough guy, Russell Crowe’s burly enforcer, breaks his arm. Crowe warns him of the precise nature of the fracture he’s about to give him, and Gosling plays it cool until the moment Crowe twists, at which point he emits a high-pitched and decidedly unmanly yelp. In Barbie, Gerwig directed Gosling to cry the way her 4-year-old son does.

This isn’t even the first time Gosling has starred opposite a doll. In 2007’s Lars and the Real Girl, he’s a pathologically withdrawn man who can’t stand the touch of a human hand. So instead of finding a nice girl, he buys one, a life-sized sex doll he names Bianca. Although she, unlike Barbie (or Ken, for that matter), is anatomically correct, Lars’ intentions are entirely courtly. (Ken’s are fairly tame too, but he goes in for a smooch a few times and is soundly rebuffed.) All he wants is someone to lavish his attention on, but he starts to notice other men noticing her, including one at a party who, after inquiring about whether Bianca is “flexible,” proclaims her the ideal woman because “she doesn’t know how hot she is.” There’s no such leering in Gosling’s performance, though, just the plaintiveness of an actor with no hesitations about playing vulnerability to its most painful ends.

The closest thing to Ken in Gosling’s previous filmography is his character in Crazy, Stupid, Love, a self-styled ladies’ man who takes Steve Carell’s hapless middle-aged dad under his wing. (In certain circles of the internet, the pair might be known as a PUA and a cuck.) Gosling’s Jacob is Ken if he’d been born to male entitlement rather than stumbling upon it later, intoxicated by his own cocksureness, and with abs so chiseled that one astonished conquest says he looks like he was created in Photoshop. He’s just this side of irredeemable, but it becomes clear that he doesn’t get any more from the women he sleeps with than they get from him. He crows that “the war between the sexes is over, and we won,” but Gosling plays him like a loser, even if he is one who looks awfully good with his shirt off.

Crazy, Stupid, Love was released in 2011, the same year as Drive, and the year that gave birth to Feminist Ryan Gosling, the wildly popular Tumblr that paired dreamy photos of Gosling with references to feminist theory. (Sample: “Hey girl, I know how Judith Butler feels about subverting the dominant paradigm and rejecting the naturalization of heteronormativity, but I got you this flower.”) It might seem counterintuitive that two of his most toxic roles might lead to Gosling being elevated as a feminist icon, but it was clear from the way he played them which side he was on, even if the dudes trying to cop his scorpion jacket weren’t in on the joke.
In The Nice Guys, Gosling’s rumpled PI laments that “the days of ladies and gentlemen are over,” but Gosling is at his best playing men whose time has passed. Perhaps he’s just so at ease with his own present that it doesn’t bruise his ego to play also-rans and second fiddles, but the sheer enthusiasm he brings to those parts, the willingness to look like a goofball or a patsy, allows him to steal the show right out from under his ostensible superiors. Even the 20th century’s most iconic doll can barely match his Kenergy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNy9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtMjAyMy1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmcta2VuLWRvbGwta2VuZXJneS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 10:13:26+00:00,Why does the Barbie movie have Republicans in such a tizzy?,"On issue after issue, Republicans have fought to undermine Barbie’s motto: ‘We girls can do anything’","Be vigilant, everyone. According to conservative lawmakers, Hollywood is attempting to manipulate the American public into consuming Chinese propaganda via subliminal messages about international maritime disputes. The culprit? A movie about dolls.
An image from Greta Gerwig’s Barbie (disclosure: I already have a ticket) has sent rightwing pundits and politicians into an uproar. Senators like Marsha Blackburn and Ted Cruz claim a cartoon map depicts the “nine-dash line” which China uses to assert control over the South China Sea. They argue that the movie’s supposed inclusion of the line legitimizes China’s position, which gives it more power over strategically important waters.
(For reference, the map in question is a highly stylized and deliberately inaccurate sketch. It also depicts England as bordering Asia. With a crown on top.)
The film’s studio, Warner Bros, responded with a much less convoluted explanation: “The doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the ‘real world’.” Republicans should know a make-believe journey when they see one – because that’s exactly the leap they make, time and time again, to invent controversies like this.
The Barbie scandal is as manufactured as the dolls themselves. It’s the latest and most absurd example of a trend as old as time: conservatives drumming up unnecessary culture wars because they are incapable of winning over voters with their deeply unpopular policies.
But just because their claims are absurd doesn’t mean they can be ignored. Because even though many so-called scandals perpetuated by the right aren’t based in reality, they can still result in real harm. Just look at how the GOP has ruthlessly targeted trans people: their baseless lies about the dangers of using the “wrong” bathroom or playing the “wrong” sport have led to the stripping away of gender-affirming care, prohibitions against trans people using bathrooms that align with their gender identity, and bans on trans kids kicking around a soccer ball at school. What starts as laughable paranoia can become lethal policy.
Back in Barbie Land, Republicans’ insistence on fabricating culture war issues isn’t limited to disputes over territorial seas. Ginger Luckey Gaetz, the 26-year-old wife of Representative Matt Gaetz, knocked the movie because it “neglects to address any notion of faith or family”. She also lamented the “disappointingly low T from Ken,” Barbie’s famously genital-free companion.
This isn’t even the first Barbie-based trans controversy that the right has attempted to gin up recently. When Mattel released a doll inspired by Laverne Cox last year, the Daily Signal called it a “dangerous message” for kids – and the anti-LGBTQ+ hate group the American Family Association accused Mattel of grooming.
As it turns out, conservatives have a long record of being offended by women like Barbie and the aspirations she represents.
With more than 250 careers under her belt, Barbie is often perceived as “a symbol of female empowerment” – so is it any wonder that she’s an easy target for reactionary backlash? While Barbie is (sometimes imperfectly) agitating for gender justice, Republicans are trying to confine her to the Dream House kitchen.
They have blocked the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, voted against the Violence Against Women Act, slashed access to reproductive care, and more – all within the last three years.
In other words: if Astronaut Barbie wants to study aerospace engineering, she can’t afford to – because Republicans successfully challenged relief for student debt, which disproportionately burdens women. Teacher Barbie may start her career with a vision to educate the next generation, only to be driven out of the profession when her red-state governor busts her union. And how can Paramedic Barbie save lives when she can’t afford childcare because conservative state lawmakers razed subsidies? On issue after issue, Republicans have fought to undermine Barbie’s motto: “We girls can do anything.”
A fantastical theory connecting Margot Robbie to the South China Sea is far less sinister than the grim, narrow reality of the future conservatives want for women. It’s only natural that they’re targeting Barbie because, as Mattel’s most recent slogan goes, Barbie wants girls to imagine the possibilities – and for conservatives, those possibilities are unimaginable.
So ignore their sleight of hand and stay focused on what really matters: whether to see Barbie before or after Oppenheimer (after) – and more importantly, how to make serious, sustained progress for all the would-be Barbies across America.
In short, to paraphrase the movie’s tagline: She’s everything. He’s just Ted.

2023-07-21 14:22:21+00:00,"What to Know About Ruth Handler, the Creator of Barbie",Here's what to know about the controversial founder of the iconic doll.,"When Greta Gerwig embarked upon her journey to create a story about a doll with no personality or inner life, she turned to Barbie’s history for inspiration. Mattel, Barbie’s parent company, led the filmmaker through an “immersion” experience—or Barbie bootcamp—that outlined the iconic doll’s long history, from her debut at the Toy Fair in New York City in 1959 to her status as the world’s most recognizable toy with over a billion dolls sold.
Gerwig latched onto the relationship between Barbie’s inventor, Ruth Handler, and Handler’s daughter Barbara, for whom Barbie is named. During an interview for TIME’s recent cover story on Barbie, Gerwig told me, “A Barbie movie is only ever going to be a mother-daughter movie on so many levels because it was Ruth Handler and Barbara—that was the relationship.”
And so Handler had to be in the movie. She first appears as a mysterious woman in a 1950s-style kitchen tucked away inside Mattel’s headquarters. Later, the film reveals that Handler is in fact the creator of Barbie and a God-like figure to Margot Robbie’s character, one of many Barbies who resides in idyllic Barbie Land. Played by Cheers alum Rhea Perlman, Gerwig portrays Handler as a kind yet imperfect deity. Here’s everything you need to know about Barbie’s creator and how she factors into the Barbie film.

How Ruth Handler invented Barbie
Ruth Handler revolutionized the toy industry when she invented a mainstream doll with the proportions of an adult female. Before Barbie came along, girls mostly played with baby dolls, an act that conditioned them to be mothers. In the early 1950s, Handler had the rather revolutionary idea that playing with dolls modeled on grown-up women would help girls imagine what they might be when they grew up. Handler drew inspiration from her daughter Barbara, who would play dress-up with paper dolls. She would eventually name her iconic doll Barbie, after her daughter.
Handler had already co-founded Mattel with her husband in 1945 to sell picture frames before they pivoted to doll furniture and, eventually other toys. But when she pitched the idea of an adult-looking doll to the company’s executives, they balked: No mother, they argued, would buy their daughter a doll with breasts. The idea stalled until 1956 when, on a European vacation, Handler saw a German doll called Bild Lilli in a store. The doll was based on a comic strip about a pin-up with a voluptuous figure and was designed as a sexy trinket for soldiers during World War II. Handler brought one of the dolls back to the U.S. to prove to Mattel’s designers that they could produce something similar.

Barbie debuted at the 1959 Toy Fair in New York City wearing the now iconic black-and-white striped bathing suit that Barbie star Margot Robbie dons in the opening of the film. The fashion doll immediately became a hit, and buoyed Mattel to success. Fans clamored for Barbie to have a boyfriend, so Ken (named for Handler’s son) was introduced in 1961. Barbie eventually transitioned from a fashion doll who just played dress-up into a career woman—who played dress-up as a doctor or astronaut in addition to a fashionista.
In her book Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Living Doll, author M.G. Lord argued that Barbie is the most potent icon of American culture of the late 20th century. “She’s an archetypal female figure, she’s something upon which little girls project their idealized selves,” she writes. “For most baby boomers, she has the same iconic resonance as any female saints, although without the same religious significance.”
Out now: TIME’s new special edition about Barbie is available at newsstands and here online
Ruth Handler was a complicated woman
As Barbie hints, Ruth Handler was a complex lady. In 1978, Handler and several other Mattel executives were indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy, mail fraud, and giving the Securities and Exchange Commission false financial statements for the company. She pleaded no contest. She was fined $57,000 and sentenced to 2,500 hours of community service.
Handler had a second act in the 1980s selling a totally different product. During a scene in Barbie Handler references her mastectomy, and the Barbie creator did indeed battle breast cancer. She saw a need for life-like prostheses designed by and for women and sold a product called Nearly Me. She led a team of eight women, most of whom were breast cancer survivors, who would visit department stores and train sales staff to fit customers. Her sales tactics included what she called her “strip act,” which involved removing her shirt to demonstrate that nobody could see or feel the difference between her real breast and her prosthetic one. People magazine featured her in such a pose. She even fit First Lady Betty Ford for the prosthesis after her mastectomy. Handler eventually sold the company to Kimberly-Clark in the 1990s.
Toward the end of her life, Handler reflected on her life as the inventor of an adult-shaped doll and a pioneer in prosthesis. According to the Los Angeles Times, she was fond of saying, “I’ve lived my life from breast to breast.”
Ruth Handler as God of Barbie Land
In the Barbie movie, the Ruth Handler role is a spiritual one. She shows up in a retro kitchen randomly tucked away in Mattel headquarters to comfort Barbie during a moment of existential crisis. She helps her escape the Mattel suits who want to put Barbie back in a box. At the time, Barbie doesn’t know who the woman is, but it is clear they have a spiritual connection.

Toward the end of the movie, Ruth reveals her identity to Barbie, insisting that of course a woman was Barbie’s original inventor—despite the fact that the Mattel boardroom is now currently dominated by men. She cracks a joke about now being beatific—referencing both her struggle with cancer and her money troubles with the government—but says that Barbie was designed not in the image of any one woman, but to be aspirational.
Barbie and Ruth have a conversation that echoes the heavenly train station moment in Harry Potter in which Dumbledore helped Harry realize he had the option to live or die. Similarly, in a glowing space, a holy Ruth councils Barbie on what it would mean to become fully human, face mortality, and leave Barbie Land to live in the real world.
Read More: We’re Ignoring the Real Reason Barbie Might Dominate the Box Office
In my interview with Greta Gerwig for TIME’s cover story on Barbie, the writer-director told me that Ruth and Barbie touch hands twice in the movie, once over tea and again at the end of the film. Gerwig modeled the hand touch on the fresco of God giving life to the first man that appears on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Here, Ruth as God instills life not in first man but in woman—specifically a doll who has long been a symbol of what womanhood ought to be (for better or worse). When Barbie leaves Barbie Land, she is leaving a matriarchal version of Eden to enter a much messier real world. It turns out, in Barbie anyway, god is a woman and a rather complicated one at that.

2023-07-22 13:16:12+00:00,'Barbie' movie revives interest in doll collectors' market,"Matthew Keith bought his first Barbie dolls in the 1970s using his allowance money, hiding them from his parents for fear they would say the toys were not masculine enough.","July 22 (Reuters) - Matthew Keith bought his first Barbie dolls in the 1970s using his allowance money, hiding them from his parents for fear they would say the toys were not masculine enough.
Today, 22 feet of bookshelves in his Los Angeles home are filled with his Barbie collection, worth around $20,000. The middle school teacher's Instagram account, ""DollsOnTheBrain,"" has more than 70,000 followers - about 15,000 of whom he picked up in the last few weeks.
What used to be an arcane hobby has become far more popular recently, fueled by the advertising campaign and audience anticipation around this weekend's film release of ""Barbie."" At thrift stores, vintage Barbie dolls have become a treasured find, prices in the collectibles market have soared, and antiques appraisers have been flooded by calls from new collectors.
Keith, 55, welcomes the enthusiasm.
""I am both happy and hopeful that this will move the needle on Barbie acceptance for everyone,"" he said in an interview, adding there are still many little boys who feel pressured not to play with the dolls.
The ""Barbie"" movie, which opened Friday, is expected to rake in $100 million in U.S. theaters on its opening weekend. Retailers around the world are also hoping to profit off its hype with Barbie-themed offerings from hotel suites to toothbrushes and apparel.
Not all longtime collectors of the iconic doll are as delighted as Keith by the recent interest in Barbie collecting. On a Reddit forum devoted to the pasttime, some complained they were being priced out by wealthy new buyers, due to a spike in interest that surged in the lead-up to the movie.
""I've largely stopped collecting dolls themselves and invest in clothing and accessories instead,"" wrote one user. ""What started out as an affordable hobby has grown too expensive to maintain.""
Florida-based veteran Barbie doll dealer Marl Davidson said prices have climbed about 25% in recent months. Her site, MarlBe.com, has been receiving about 3,000 daily hits, triple the usual, many of whom are from people starting collections.

""I've never seen this kind of interest. It's really bringing a lot of new adults into the Barbie-collecting world,"" Davidson said.
Collector dolls are usually around $100, while non-collector dolls typically range from $10-$30. The so-called ""Holy Grail"" Barbie, the first model produced in 1959, sells for thousands of dollars.
Dr. Lori Verderame, an art historian and TV personality with 25 years of experience as an antiques appraiser, said the Barbie doll owners who usually seek her expertise are seasoned collectors assessing the insurance value of their trove.
But the movie has generated a roughly 60% increase in demand for Barbie appraisals in the past month, beating out other brands of dolls that are usually more popular, according to Verderame.
""Barbie appraisals don't normally come the way they've been coming,"" she said. ""I've seen some very rare and wonderful dolls for appraisals that we might not have seen if it wasn't for the movie.""
Many of those have come from people with little or no experience in doll collecting, such as a person who purchased a Barbie at a thrift store that turned out to be valued at more than $10,000. Another found a doll that had been sitting in her mother's house for years, which turned out to be worth $8,500.
Verderame said many valuable Barbies are ""still out there to be found on the treasure hunt in thrift stores,"" but added that the current spike in seller interest is only likely to last about two more weeks.
Keith, the Los Angeles collector, has never paid more than $230 for a Barbie doll, but he said many of the dolls in his collection have appreciated in value since he bought them.
""I feel like Barbie has elevated my personal finances, even though I've put a lot of money into her since 1991,"" he said.

As of Aug. 14, “Barbie” — a comedy starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll who goes through an existential crisis — has crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide (earning $1.18 billion so far), making Gerwig the first solo female director to do so. But “Oppenheimer,” in which Cillian Murphy portrays the father of the atomic bomb, has also stood its ground, making $648 million globally — an amazing feat for a three-hour-long film based on a historical figure.
Though “Barbie” has held tightly onto the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office since its release, “Oppenheimer” has fought its way to the top in other major markets, including India and Hong Kong. And, both films have stirred up some controversy in various countries due to their themes — specifically, “Barbie’s” feminist undertones and “Oppenheimer’s” depiction of the creation of the bombs that were dropped in Japan — oftentimes making one the winner by default.

At the end of Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) tells Barbie creator Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) that she doesn't feel like Barbie anymore. She decides to be human, and the final scene finds Barbie in the backseat of Gloria's (America Ferrera) car, wearing a tan blazer. Gloria, her husband (Ferrera's actual husband Ryan Piers Williams), and her daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) drop Barbie off and wish her luck. We see her step out of the car wearing pink Birkenstocks, and give her name as Barbara Handler, telling the receptionist: ""I'm here to see my gynecologist.""

That final line is one for the ages—but we're particularly enamored with Barbara's pink Birkenstocks, which represent a twist on Barbie's first journey into the real world. When Barbie first visits Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to find out why her feet are now flat, Weird Barbie gives her the choice of a heel or a Birkenstock sandal—stay in Barbieland or venture to the real world. While Barbie tries to stay, she reluctantly concedes she needs to go to the real world—setting off a journey that brings her to California, and introduces her to Gloria.

Greta Gerwig sure thinks so!
Speaking with PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue (out now) alongside stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more, the director and co-writer, 39, says she hopes her film ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.""
""There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,"" Gerwig adds. ""I want to go back to Barbie Land.""
Praising Gerwig, Robbie, 33, tells PEOPLE, ""Greta has a very specific thing where she can be very silly and very clever at the same time, but it’s also very heartfelt.""
""Her humor never feels cynical or cold,"" continues the actress, who plays the titular doll alongside Gosling, 42, as Ken. ""It’s always warm and loving, but also really, really silly and kind of zany and absurd. I actually think it’s a bit of a throwback in tone. To be honest, I don’t feel like I’ve seen a movie that utilizes that kind of comedy in a long, long time.""

Gerwig's comments to PEOPLE about potential future Barbie film iterations come after Robbie addressed the possibility a TIME magazine cover story published last month.
""I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels,"" said the Oscar-nominated actress.
Still, she has been part of conversations about what the future holds for Barbie in terms of a cinematic experience to follow the upcoming movie, in theaters later this month.
""It could go a million different directions from this point,"" Robbie said.

Asked how she began thinking about Barbie as a character, Gerwig tells PEOPLE, ""Of course, I’ve known who Barbie is for forever, and there’s some sort of collective memory that I wanted to tap into, something about: We invent things like dolls to explain to ourselves what it means to be human.""
""Part of me wondered if there was a way that we could allow the doll to also have that humanity,"" she adds. ""Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the Queen of Plastic was given something real?""

2023-07-24 11:35:16-04:00,What does it mean to be “just Ken”?,Barbie’s most thrilling fantasy: Kens are just accessories,"He’s. Just. Ken.
In the lead-up for director Greta Gerwig’s Barbie’s release, the movie’s marketing team deployed the extremely savvy strategy of stating an obvious truth about Barbie Land. Barbies are mermaids, presidents, doctors, diplomats, and Supreme Court justices. The Kens? Only Ken.
The movie’s prolific tagline put it plainly: “She’s everything. He’s just Ken.”
In the context of Barbie Land and Ken and Barbie’s long history together, Barbie’s accomplishments and Ken’s lack of them aren’t bad or good — these are just the facts. Ken doesn’t have a plethora of careers at his disposal, nor is his name on the deed of the Malibu Dreamhouse. They might not even be boyfriend-girlfriend — that’s for Barbie to say.
Ken has a great day only if Barbie notices him. Ken has no bearing on Barbie’s day.
“He’s just Ken” caught fire not just because Gerwig’s movie shined a spotlight on Barbie’s hidden-in-plain-sight feminist dynamic, but also because we — real people — don’t live in Barbie Land. In our world, women are taught that having everything is impossible without compromise and that, unlike Barbie and just like Ken, they should conform to the hobbies, careers, and whims of their heterosexual partners.
A world where men are just Kens, and could be happy just being Kens, is a thrilling fantasy (even if that fantasy is complicated by Barbie herself).
Despite Ken’s designed vacancy, he’s somehow created an exciting conversation about how we think about ambition and companionship, and how we’ve been taught to view those things.
What does it mean to be Ken?
The second you meet Ken — blonde, smiling, tan— you understand all there is to know about him. What you see is what you get. He’ll never be anything more or anything less. Ken is and will always be Ken.
But why is Ken the way he is? Ken debuted in 1961 as Ken Carson, two years after Barbie was created. Mattel made him to be Barbie’s companion, a re-telling of Adam and Eve but in tawny plastic. (The Barbie doll’s last name, for the record, is canonically Roberts.)
“Ken was really viewed as more of an accessory in Barbie’s world, to support the narrative of whatever was happening with the girls,” Michael Shore told GQ in 2017. At the time, Shore was head of Mattel’s head of global consumer insights.
Barbie Land is a place where kids — predominantly young girls — are in control of the story. The narrative, which continues to this day and is alive in Gerwig’s new movie, is that Barbie is the center of her universe.
The world Barbie the toy lives in celebrates the things we associate with girliness — pink, softness, sunshine, friendship. It doesn’t put the same kind of value on concepts we associate with masculinity.
In this world, Ken isn’t centered and, more importantly, he doesn’t mind. There’s no impulse to make him a main character. There’s no angst when he isn’t. He exists outside the spotlight without resentment.
This also means Barbie can be anything that she wants to be: a president, a doctor, a model, a chef, a doggie day care owner, a chief sustainability officer, a makeup artist, a gameshow host, an astrophysicist, a pilot, and everything in between, without sacrificing her girliness. She also can have everything she wants: a car, an airplane, a “dream” house, all the clothes, a best friend in Midge, three sisters — Skipper, Stacie, Chelsea — and according to deep lore, over 40 pets including a panda and a zebra.
Ken’s life can’t threaten that narrative — that’s why it’s Barbie’s Dreamhouse and Barbie’s Corvette and not jointly owned.
If Ken is president, that could affect Barbie’s astronaut adventures. If Ken has a bestie like Midge, he might have a boys’ night that interferes with Barbie’s plans. If Ken has a pet, then that’s less attention for Barbie’s zebra.
Canonically, while Ken was introduced as Barbie’s boyfriend, he’s often portrayed as a “best friend,” which indicates he doesn’t have to be a love interest. They also have never been married, further signaling an openness about their relationship and a freedom that’s in Barbie’s hands.
Ken complements her life, making it better in the only way he knows how, by being Ken. Like Barbie’s multiple jobs, her friends, her pets, her houses, and her vehicles, Ken is just one thing in her life rather than the only thing.
She’s everything and he’s just Ken
“No one really wants a Ken,” Maria Teresa Hart, a Barbie expert and author of Doll, a book about doll culture, told me. Her main gripe with the movie is seeing Ken with the same kind of billing as Barbie, since Ken is, according to Hart and Shore and many others, an accessory. “Ken is a doll that you would get, but never ask for.”
Things that you get but never really ask for include the flu, back pain, pimples, incorrect change, and, apparently, Ken. Hart explains that Barbie and Ken aren’t equals in ambition, power, or even something as minuscule as wardrobe — and it was purposely designed this way. Malibu Ken (a Ken variant that became the signature Ken), she says, only had a pair of swim trunks, “and he never ever got another stitch of clothing.”
In the hope of bucking downward sales trends, Mattel introduced a brand new line of Kens — with different skin colors, hair, and body shapes — in 2017. At the time, it was reported that kids, mainly young girls, had one Ken doll for every seven Barbies. Mattel has continued to release a diverse array of Kens since then, but it’s unclear whether or not this has equalized the Barbie-Ken disparity.
It’s apparently extremely difficult to compete with a woman who is everything.
The movie’s tagline became such a phenomenon because Barbie’s matriarchal dreamland feels revolutionary. It’s in opposition to our own world, where we have plenty of stories about women who are everything — brilliant, buoyant, sparkly — settling for disappointing men (Kens, if you will).
In pop culture, this applies to Legally Blonde’s Elle Woods and her loser ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III; Hunger Games’s Katniss Everdeen and either of her lackluster love interests; Meredith Grey and McDreamy (the editorial team at Vox is split when it comes to describing McDreamy as “disappointing”); the villains of 2021’s Scream, Shiv and Tom; Ali Wong’s hot, vacant husband from Beef; and the couple in Midsommar. “She’s everything and he’s just Ken” also happens in real life: Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, Taylor Swift and any of her boyfriends — any of them, doesn’t matter who.
Gerwig’s Barbie centers on this tension too, teasing out the idea of what would happen to the Barbie Land’s Garden of Eden if Ken recognized that he’d be treated better in a world created by the patriarchy. Ken even gets a song in the film, “I’m just Ken,” singing “I’m just Ken, anywhere else, I’d be a 10.” Outside of Barbie Land, Ken could be the main character. Ken could have all the ambition. Ken wouldn’t be an accessory.
Ken wouldn’t be just Ken, and Barbie wouldn’t get to be everything. Barbie’s revolutionary power fantasy would be in peril.
Maybe Kens do deserve better than to feel like accessories. Perhaps they deserve a life where they can have their own cars and houses, and don’t have to conform to their partner’s needs and ambitions. But we already have a world where that happens; Barbie deserves a better one.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS8yMDIzLzcvMjQvMjM4MDU2MDgvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLWV4cGxhaW5lZC0yMDIzLWtlbi1mZW1pbmlzdC1pbS1qdXN0LWtlbi1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 15:55:00+00:00,Weird Barbie's House Is the Best Home in the 'Barbie' Movie,Production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer share how Weird Barbie's house was created for the Barbie movie. See behind-the-scenes pics.,"Barbie’s dream house seemingly has it all. But hear me out: Weird Barbie’s house in the new movie Barbie is actually the best home in Barbie Land. Although it may not have essentials, like a kitchen, or fun amenities, like a spiral slide, certain elements cement it as a desirable piece of toy real estate.
Like Weird Barbie (played by Kate McKinnon) herself, the house has gone through the wringer. “The premise of the Weird Barbie house is that it’s grown out of a Barbie dream house,” production designer Sarah Greenwood tells House Beautiful, noting that the home has similar proportions to the Barbie dream houses and features the same pinks.
With not a single right angle built into the architecture, Weird Barbie’s house is designed to look a bit squashed. Its aura is reminiscent of Boo Radley’s house in To Kill a Mockingbird; You don’t want to go near it, but you’re still curious about it, Greenwood says. The structure was also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho with its hilltop location and winding stair-clad path. Swirls of color, groovy lights, and interior screen block walls ensure the home retains a lively atmosphere rather than a sinister one.

Marked by a funky gated entrance, the home undoubtedly offers the most privacy in Barbie Land. The journey to the secluded structure is daily step count goal-friendly and allows visitors time to admire the surrounding landscaping. Tall trees hide the sides and back of the house while giving the home an immersed-in-nature feel. The abode is open at the front in typical Barbie doll house fashion, meaning it has completely unobstructed views of everything from the pink sand Malibu beach to the Barbie dream houses inspired by iconic Palm Springs architecture below.

The home may not be equipped with a furnished bedroom or a kitchen, but it has two dining rooms with vibrant, marbleized furniture. Colorful bubble chandeliers made of Murano glass from Simone Cenedese add a whimsical touch. At the heart of the home, the living room comes with a plush rug (specifically, this one from Sahrai) resembling a puddle of melted rainbow ice cream—perfect for lying down on during an existential crisis or taking a nap. That room even has a pop-out, 3-D map of Barbie Land (which is real, not CGI!). It could, in reality, act as a space-saving table for meals or board games.

Outside, there’s an off-kilter pool with floating furniture and drinks at the ready. A pool shark and an odd cat statue nearby amplify the home’s strange playfulness. “She had a vulture as a mailbox because a vulture is also slightly alien,” set decorator Katie Spencer tells House Beautiful.

Apart from its straightforward elements, the home acts as a safe haven for discontinued toys in the movie. (The production team replicated Barbie’s pooping dog Tanner and Ken’s little white dog Sugar!) Better yet, the home serves as a headquarters for our heroes following the Barbie Land takeover led by the Kens. That’s also where Weird Barbie’s vehicle comes into play for rescuing the Barbies.
Weird Barbie’s ambulance is like a small version of her house. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
The ambulance is designed to look like a mobile version of her house, which Greenwood says was based on the Creepy Coupe in the 1968 Wacky Races cartoon series. “Weird Barbie is going out in armor, like a snail or a turtle,” Spencer says of the vehicle. “She has her own protection because she's vulnerable, and you see that at the end.”

While Weird Barbie's house may lack a few necessities, I'd put my Monopoly money down on it. The wacky home is a color-loving minimalist and extroverted introvert’s paradise with unbeatable views and matching transportation.

2023-07-21 14:54:13+00:00,Ken's Journey in Barbie Is a Story About Male Fragility,"Along with Don't Worry Darling and Promising Young Woman, Barbie asks what to do with the modern man who feels emasculated by women's power.","This story contains spoilers for Barbie
Who knew that “He’s just Ken” was more than a marketing joke? The Barbie movie centers, of course, on its titular character played by Margot Robbie. But Ken (Ryan Gosling) plays an important role in the drama as he wrangles with the notion that he’s long been an accessory in Barbie’s dream life more than an equal partner. I’ll say the quiet part out loud: Even though this is a movie that leans heavily into a feminine aesthetic and is, as writer-director Greta Gerwig told me during an interview for TIME’s Barbie cover story, a film at its core for mothers and daughters, Ken has the most intriguing and funniest part to play, offering a searing social commentary on modern man’s insecurities dressed up in bubble-gum pink.

More from TIME
Perhaps we shouldn’t have expected less from the mind behind Lady Bird and Little Women. Gerwig transforms a joke about the forgettable male doll into a meditation on the state of masculinity at a moment when so many young men, feeling disempowered, have found misguided solace in the patriarchy. It’s a B-plot that’s so compelling it often outshines the somewhat dated girl-power mantras of Barbie’s A-plot.
Ken’s awakening
From the start of the film, Ken smarts at Barbie’s small rejections. He seethes when she talks to other Kens, particularly the one played by Simu Liu, whom he sees as a rival. He doesn’t have a real job or home or purpose outside of Barbie. Then Ken leaves Barbieland, a feminist utopia, and enters the real world, where men run, well, everything. In short, Ken discovers the patriarchy and decides to bring it back to Barbieland, establishing his own “Kendom.”
In a clever bit of screenwriting, Ken cares more about the sartorial manifestations of the patriarchy than the patriarchy itself. He is, after all, a fashion doll. When he discovers that demolishing feminism involves more than donning Sylvester Stallone-inspired fur coats, riding horses, and redecorating Barbie’s Dreamhouse into what he dubs his Mojo Dojo Casa House, he loses interest. He’s easily distracted by acting out war games with the other Kens, allowing the Barbies take back Barbieland from the boys.
By the end of the movie, Barbie and Ken have to have a serious conversation about their relationship. Barbie makes it clear she’s not interested in Ken romantically and urges him to find his own personal passions. The finale not only flips the normal script on female-centric films—in which a woman discovers she doesn’t need a man to find her inner power (Legally Blonde, Eat Pray Love, etc.)—but offers a commentary on how men ought to reassess their own desires outside of their need to both control and depend on women.

A story that will resonate with men
Ken (Gosling) would like more attention from Barbie (Robbie) Courtesy of Warner Bros.
During interviews for the cover story on Barbie in this magazine, producer David Heyman suggested that men of all ages would find resonance with Ken’s journey. “I think Ryan is undeniable and so affecting in the film. People really care for Ken even when he’s misguided,” he says. “I think a lot of boys and men will find there’s a lot to relate to in Ken as they try to find their place in the world. But it’s all done with such a light touch and such generosity, and Ryan is just, I think, extraordinary.”
Gosling does, indeed, pull off what could have bene a tricky character. If Ken weren’t so ridiculous, he’d be threatening. Ken isn’t an incel exactly. Short for “involuntary celibate,” incel is a term that certain men use for themselves to describe a state where they feel rejected by women, and resentful toward them as a result. These men spend a lot of time on internet forums bashing feminists and longing for the days when women didn’t work, men controlled women’s bodies, and men’s mere earning power could all but “guarantee” them a sexual partner or wife. These online misogynist groups are a breeding ground for toxic language that has also spilled over into real-world violence.
Ken is more mild-mannered than that. He doesn’t have the, um, parts down there to even really understand what sex is. When he tries to kiss Barbie goodnight, she stares at him blankly. When he asks to stay over, she asks innocently what they would do. He charmingly replies that he doesn’t know. But the implication is certainly that Ken would really prefer if he had more of Barbie’s attention: He can never stay over because Barbie tells him “every night is girls’ night,” and while the Barbies live in the dream houses, the Kens don’t seem to have their own homes. (Maybe they live on the beach and that’s why Ken’s job is, nonsensically, “Beach.”)
Read More: We’re Ignoring the Real Reason Barbie Might Dominate the Box Office
When Ken enters the real world, people suddenly call him “sir” and ask for his advice or help. While men on Venice Beach ogle Barbie, they treat Ken with a certain degree of respect. Ken is enthralled by this newfound power. Unfortunately, he learns that he can’t just walk his way into a job as a banker or doctor. He complains to one man in a business suit that his company must not be “doing patriarchy right” if a man without any qualifications can’t get a job. The businessman assures him that they are doing patriarchy correctly, they just need to hide it better than they used to. So Ken eventually decides that if he cannot participate in the patriarchy in the real world, he’ll bring the philosophy back to Barbieland, transforming it into the Kendom.
When Ken quickly falls under the sway of the patriarchy and returns to Barbieland to preach its gospel, one can’t help but think of certain male rights activists recruiting impressionable young followers.
Male fragility onscreen, beyond Ken
Florence Pugh and Harry Styles in Don't Worry Darling Merrick Morton—Warner Bros.
Gerwig isn’t the first director to wrestle with this problem in recent years. Watching Barbie, I couldn’t help but think of last year’s Olivia Wilde movie Don’t Worry Darling. These films seemingly have nothing to do with one another. One’s a musical romp, the other a sci-fi inspired psychodrama.
But the third-act twist of Don’t Worry Darling—major spoilers ahead for this fraught film—is that Florence Pugh’s character isn’t actually living in a 1950s suburban utopia. She’s trapped in a simulation by her partner (Harry Styles). Feeling emasculated by his wife’s taxing job as a doctor and his own unemployment, Styles’ character listens to a men’s rights podcast and falls under the influence of its host, played by Chris Pine. Wilde says Pine’s character was inspired by Jordan Peterson, whom she describes as a “hero to the incel community.” The hypnotic podcast host convinces Styles that both he and Pugh would be happier living in a fantasy throwback to an era where the men worked and the women played housewife. Pugh eventually figures out the trick and comes into violent confrontation with her captor.

Other shows and films have explored similar territory: The excellent 2017 Black Mirror episode USS Callister reveals over the course of its runtime that a talented but oft-mocked coder (Jesse Plemons) has stolen the DNA of the people in his life he resents (mostly women of color) and forced them into a simulation where he plays the captain of a Star Trek-like ship.
Emerald Fennell (who makes a cameo in Barbie) explored the simmering violence lurking beneath the surface of self-styled “nice guys” in her 2020 thriller Promising Young Woman, even casting actors who cultivated those reputations in other projects like Adam Brody (The O.C.) and Max Greenfield (New Girl) to drive home the point to the audience.
All of these films draw at least some inspiration from the original Stepford Wives book (and its various film and television adaptations). The satirical feminist horror story chronicles a husband’s conspiracy to subjugate his working wife after they move to a community filled with strangely robotic women who live to serve their spouses.

The fantasy of finding equilibrium
Ken (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Ken (Gosling), and Ken (Ncuti Gatwa) Courtesy of Warner Bros.
Ryan Gosling’s portrayal of Ken in Barbie is lighter and funnier than these more serious takes on the resentful man who works to repress the women around him. Heyman is right that we empathize with Ken when he’s ignored by Barbie and root for him to find his meaning.
But at its root, his energy—or “kenergy”—is not dissimilar from the men in these other stories. His feelings of emasculation manifest in shows of aggressive behavior, albeit satirical ones. Like Styles in Don’t Worry Darling, he seems not just resentful but without a purpose in a world where women pursue their passions. Both movies are deeply interested in the idea that modern men feel uncomfortable ceding power to women and what it means for their identities.

What, in the end, are women to do about this male fragility? Barbie offers a complicated and not entirely satisfying answer. The Barbies eventually overthrow the Kendom and reach a detente with the Kens. They will give the Kens as much power in Barbieland as women have in the real world. Just a few judgeships, not half of them. And cabinet positions, but not the presidency.
It’s not exactly equality, but it’s a compromise. Whether such an equilibrium can or should be reached in the real world the film doesn’t try to answer. Nor is it necessarily the responsibility of a fun musical romp to do so. In the end, Ken, specifically, learns that he’s “Kenough” without Barbie, a resolution that plays better as a pun than an edict for the modern man.

,'Barbie' sparks conversations on China's power in Hollywood,"One of the summer’s blockbuster movies, ""Barbie,"" arrives in theaters Friday, but it is accompanied by controversy.","WASHINGTON — One of the summer’s blockbuster movies, “Barbie,” arrives in theaters Friday amidst controversy.
What You Need To Know The movie includes the so-called “nine-dash line” in a cartoon-like map of Southeast Asia
China uses that line to assert sovereignty over the South China Sea — a claim rejected by an international court
The issue is so sensitive that Vietnam banned the movie
Warner Bros. Film Group said the map was “not intended to make any kind of statement”
A scene in the movie has longtime-critics of the People’s Republic of China accusing the filmmakers and Hollywood of caving to pressure from the Communist country.
“I don’t know if it was just an oversight or an accident or if it was intentional,” Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Select Committee on China. “Now, I suspect it’s the latter, just because I’ve seen so many instances of censorship and self-censorship by Hollywood.”
Gallagher said “Barbie” crosses the line by including the so-called “nine-dash line” in a cartoon-like map of Southeast Asia. China uses that line to assert sovereignty over the South China Sea — a claim rejected by an international court. The issue is so sensitive that Vietnam banned the movie.
Warner Bros. Film Group said the map was “not intended to make any kind of statement.” But Ann Lau, a Los Angeles-based free speech activist, said she isn’t buying that explanation.
“Even though they actually put in eight dashes in the nine-dash line, I’m sure they knew about it,” Lau said. “And they just wanted to please China.”
Lau and her family fled the Great Chinese Famine for Hong Kong in 1962.
“Within three months, the Hong Kong government finally started to send the people back to China,” Lau said. “The international community was saying that, if they sent these Chinese people back to China, these people will face repression.”
She was among 15,000 Chinese refugees able to relocate to the U.S. under then-president John F. Kennedy’s Hong Kong parole program.
“Because of that, I felt that it is so important that we have this right to speak about the facts or what’s going on around the world,” Lau said.
She now serves as the chair of the Visual Artists Guild, speaking out against the Chinese government and its economic influence over U.S. and global media.
“The problem with Hollywood bending to China is that it actually helps to promote China — what is called, soft power or soft propaganda — so that the general public of Americans would accept this notion that China is just like any other country,” Lau said.
Gallagher, Lau and other critics said Hollywood routinely self-censors to maintain access to China’s massive $4.6 billion film market. Gallagher has previously called out changes to the 2012 remake of “Red Dawn” and last year’s blockbuster “Top Gun Maverick.” The former changed the nationality of the film’s antagonists from Chinese to North Korean. The latter digitally removed Taiwan’s flag from a character’s jacket before adding it back during its theatrical run.
Gallagher said he’s open to continuing this conversation on Capitol Hill.
“I’d love to have that conversation,” he said. “And by the way, if [Warner Bros.], in this case, wants to explain that it was just an innocent mistake, well, then I offer them a platform to come before our committee. We can do a closed-door session if they want.”
A spokesperson for Warner Bros. declined to respond to Gallagher’s invitation and comments.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL3dpL21pbHdhdWtlZS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIzLzA3LzIwL2JhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1zcGFya3MtY29udmVyc2F0aW9ucy1vbi1jaGluYS1zLXNvZnQtcG93ZXItb3Zlci1ob2xseXdvb2TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-13 20:18:48+00:00,The 'Barbie' movie's latest marketing collab is a hot pink Burger King combo meal,"The combo includes a burger, milkshake and fries, but is only available in Brazil.","The ""Barbie"" marketing machine keeps on cooking up new collabs.
In the run-up to the blockbuster's July 21 release, consumers have been inundated by ""Barbie"" merch ranging from dog toys to roller skates. The latest partnership brings Barbie into the world of fast food.
Burger King Brazil this week unveiled a Barbie-themed meal. The BK Barbie Combo features a cheeseburger topped with bacon bits and dressed with a bright pink sauce that Burger King says has a ""smoky"" flavor.
Customers will also receive a pink vanilla milkshake with strawberry Nesquik powder mixed in. Once the straw is put into the dessert, Burger King tops it off with a pink frosted donut.
As a side, diners will receive an order of ""Ken's potatoes,"" which are just a plain order of fries, in keeping with the ""he's just Ken"" verbiage on the movie's poster.
Burger King's posts on TikTok and Instagram advertising the limited time combo have garnered millions of views.
It's not the first time that Burger King has offered a movie-themed meal. Just last month, the chain released a red-bunned Whopper in collaboration with Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.""
But unlike the Spider-Man burger, it doesn't appear that the BK Barbie Combo will be making its way stateside. Your best bet will be to get on the next flight to São Paulo.
A representative for Burger King did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.

2023-08-11 09:51:07+00:00,'Barbie' movie opens in Japan after atomic bomb controversy,"Hollywood blockbuster ""Barbie"" hit theatres in Japan on Friday, where ""Barbenheimer"" memes linking the doll-themed film with the atomic bomb caused a stir and made distributor Warner Bros apologise ahead of the release.","TOKYO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Hollywood blockbuster ""Barbie"" hit theatres in Japan on Friday, where ""Barbenheimer"" memes linking the doll-themed film with the atomic bomb caused a stir and made distributor Warner Bros (WBD.O) apologise ahead of the release.
Tickets for ""Barbie"", starring Margot Robbie in the title role, nevertheless sold fast in Japan as fans flocked to the theatrical release, timed to coincide with a national holiday marking the first day of Japan's extended summer holiday week.
""The pink world of Barbie was absolutely beautiful,"" said Misaki Suzuki, 29-year-old nail salon worker, after watching the film at a Tokyo cinema.
""Barbie"" has topped $1 billion in global box office since its July 21 debut, making writer and director Greta Gerwig the first female filmmaker to surpass that benchmark as a solo director. The success of the fantasy-comedy was further boosted by the coupling with ""Oppenheimer"", the biopic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb during World War Two that opened on the same weekend.
But the ""Barbenheimer"" combo sparked a backlash in Japan, as the nation earlier this month marked the memorials of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 78 years ago.
In now-deleted posts on platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Warner Bros' ""Barbie"" marketing account had latched on to fan-produced memes that depicted Robbie with ""Oppenheimer"" actor Cillian Murphy alongside images of nuclear blasts.
A Change.org petition was launched on Aug 1, demanding that Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind ""Oppenheimer"", call a halt to the #Barbenheimer hashtag on social media. It has collected about 22,600 signatures to date.
A #NoBarbenheimer hashtag trended in Japan at the time, prompting Warner's Japan division to issue a rare public criticism of its U.S. parent company, which then followed with an apology last week.
Mitsuki Takahata, who voiced Barbie in the dubbed Japanese version, said in an Aug 2 Instagram post that she was dismayed upon learning of the memes. ""This incident is really, really disappointing,"" she posted.
Still, Japanese fans of the movie, which sends Mattel Inc's (MAT.O) iconic doll into real life, said the controversy did not discourage them from visiting theatres.
""It was harsh"", said 24-year-old university student Rie Takeda, commenting on the fan-produced #Barbenheimer memes.
""But the movie was radiant, beyond that I had fun"" watching it, she said.
No Japan release date has been announced for ""Oppenheimer"", which has been criticised for largely ignoring the atomic bomb's destruction of two major Japanese cities in 1945, accounting for more than 200,000 deaths.

2023-07-25 16:07:41+00:00,Unstoppable Kenergy: how did Ryan Gosling steal the Barbie movie?,"The Oscar-nominated actor delivers a knockout comic performance in Greta Gerwig’s Mattel movie, playing on male insecurities and toxic masculinity","Now that the whole world has apparently gone to see Barbie, it seems like the secret is finally out. Margot Robbie is not the star of Barbie. Yes, she plays the lead. Yes, she produced it. Yes, she gets to spend a lot of time running around in nice dresses. But the star? Heavens, no. If you’ve seen Barbie, then you’ll be fully aware that the star of the film is actually Ryan Gosling.
Gosling plays Ken, Barbie’s superfluous paramour. But while Barbie has been the central force of the film’s heavy-handed marketing campaign, it turns out that the film is secretly a Ken vehicle. Ken gets the juiciest character arc. He gets all the good jokes. He gets a musical number. He gets more than one musical number. He’s self-aware, self-referential and complicated. It might just qualify as the greatest role of Ryan Gosling’s life.
It is indeed an unexpectedly meaty role. Although Ken could have simply been a one-joke character, writers Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have enriched him with a complex inner turmoil. The film’s Ken wants so badly to be acknowledged by Barbie that his neediness warps into an ugly caricature of masculinity that spreads to the other Kens, until they have infected Barbieland with the sort of cartoon patriarchy that sees them deliver heartfelt sermons about the work of Stephen Malkmus.
His reckoning, too, is surprisingly profound. The climax of the film technically comes when Barbie decides that she wants to be a real girl, but all the emotional heft comes 10 minutes earlier, as Ken grapples with the concept of internal validation, realising that he can never truly be happy until he learns who he is outside of his relationship with Barbie. Gosling plays a lot of this for comic effect, but there’s a palpable rawness to it as well. Reviewers have compared the scene to the heart-wrenching work he did in Blue Valentine for a reason.
Also, though, it’s plain for all to see that Gosling is just having a whale of a time. He turns in an old-fashioned movie star performance the likes of which we don’t tend to see much of these days. He’s Ken, and he’s committed to being Ken. But at the same time, he’s Ryan Gosling, winking and smirking at the audience like he can’t believe he’s getting away with it. It’s like watching Jack Nicholson right in the sweet spot era between being an intense young actor and coasting off his self-image. It’s like watching Bruce Willis, before he learned to use his smirk to insulate himself against bad material.
More than anything, this is a sign that Gosling should do more comedy. This isn’t his first comedy by any means, of course. He was great, if under-utilised, in Crazy Stupid Love. He located all the right comic beats in La La Land. His work on The Nice Guys remains criminally underrated. But something about Ken fits the man like a glove. If he can find more roles that play to his strengths so effectively, there’ll be no stopping him.
And you sense that Gosling knows this too, given the giddy abandon in which he flung himself into promoting Barbie before the Sag-Aftra strike. Long before the movie came out, he seemed to latch on to the sheer meme-ability of Ken, talking grandly of all the various traits that make a Ken a Ken. He did a GQ essentials video that lapsed in and out of character so seamlessly it is now impossible to identify where Ryan ends and Ken begins. He reportedly got T-shirts for the cast reading “When you Ken like lightning, you crash like thunder”. He has mentioned that he has had trouble shaking his inner Ken post-shooting, hinting that it has lingered within him like Austin Butler’s Elvis accent. It is by some distance the most committed piece of movie promotion we have seen since everyone in the MCU pretended that they were all best friends. If this isn’t his way of tacitly telling Hollywood the lengths he’ll go to for another good comic role, I don’t know what is.
But maybe he won’t need to wait too long. The Barbie movie has been an overwhelming commercial success, and everyone knows that success begets sequels. But (spoiler alert) Barbie doesn’t leave a lot of room for more, given that it ends with Barbie being granted a spiritual death that allows her to ascend to the real world. So you know what that means? It means that we – and Ryan Gosling – should brace ourselves for the prospect of The Ken Movie in 2025.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvanVsLzI1L3J5YW4tZ29zbGluZy1rZW4tYmFyYmllLW1vdmll0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Marc Maron weighed in on male critics of ""Barbie"" in a fiery new TikTok posted to his page earlier this week.
The ""Glow"" actor began by praising Greta Gerwig's vision for the film, which he called a ""fucking masterpiece.""
""I didn't know what to expect, I wasn't even that excited about going,"" Maron revealed.
He said the film, written by Gerwig and husband Noah Baumbach, creates ""a sort of broad-based entertainment product that applies to the entire spectrum, I think primarily of women, and then just seep it in progressive politics and basic feminism, in a way that's funny, informative, and well-executed.""

""Fucking monumental,"" Maron said of ""Barbie.""
He then noted that the film is ""pretty radical,"" even though it ""shouldn't be,"" especially in its ""inspired"" comedic takes on masculinity.
Maron cited an Insider article by Beatrice Nolan, which reported that conservatives, including Ben Shapiro, have been so incensed by the film's feminist message and ""anti-man"" attitude that they've boycotted it and, in Shapiro's case, even burned Barbie and Ken dolls in protest.
""Any dude that can't take those hits in that movie, they've really got to look in their pants and decide what they're made of,"" Maron said. ""Jesus Christ, what a bunch of fucking insecure babies.""

Maron concluded his video by doubling down on his praise of film, telling followers: ""It made me proud somehow.""

,Matchbox Twenty on Being Included in 'Barbie' Film: 'We Were an Easy Takedown',"Rob Thomas, frontman of Matchbox Twenty, opened up to 'USA Today' about his band's song, ""Push,"" being featured in the 'Barbie' movie.","Rob Thomas is no stranger to his band Matchbox Twenty being the butt of jokes — after all, it’s been happening for three decades now.
But don’t think for one second that the frontman is easily offended by his band’s hit song “Push” being covered by Ken in one particularly hilarious scene in the new Barbie movie, which is presently lighting up box offices worldwide.
In the unforgettable scene, Ken, played by a platinum-haired Ryan Gosling, sits by the campfire in so-called Kendom, strumming his guitar while singing Matchbox Twenty’s alt-rock classic over and over as he serenades Margot Robbie’s Barbie.
“When I got the call for Barbie, they told me, ‘Ken’s by the fireside, he’s playing the song and it’s his favorite band.’ So I did this thinking I’d be the butt of the joke, and I was fine with that. I’m pretty thick-skinned."" Thomas told USA Today. ""But Julie Greenwald [from Atlantic Records] came to the Hollywood Bowl a month or two ago. She had just seen the movie and was like, ‘You come out of it loving Ken and loving 'Push.' And I was like, ‘Aww. Alright, really good!’ ”
Jaap Buitendijk
Perhaps Thomas, 51, was initially hesitant about his song being featured in a movie because he is well aware of Matchbox Twenty’s notoriety as a band that is cool to ridicule.
""There was a whole period during the '90s where the more successful we got, the bigger target we were. We were an easy takedown,” Thomas explained. “I want to preface this by saying that I thought it was hilarious. But in Bring It On, [Kirsten Dunst’s character] has this douchey boyfriend. And there’s a scene where he was in his dorm room with a Matchbox Twenty poster in the background.""
Hitting the Billboard Top 10 in 1997, ""Push"" was taken from Matchbox Twenty's 1996 debut album Yourself or Someone Like You. The autobiographical lyrics are about a man who is experiencing emotional abuse from his partner.
In the world of Barbieland, delicate Ken, who feels disrespected and taken for granted by the matriarchy, belts out ""Push"" — which features the lyrics, ""I wanna push you around, well, I will, well, I will"" — as his anthem as he embraces his toxic masculinity.
At the time of the song’s release in the '90s, some feminist groups expressed outrage at what they perceived to be misogynistic lyrical content from the Orlando band, with people attempting to get the song banned from radio for encouraging violence against women.
“I wrote that song about someone I had been with who I felt was manipulating me and taking advantage of me. The ’90s was a time of manufactured angst, and nobody wanted to be a victim in a song,” Thomas said. “But at the time I was in my early 20s. I didn’t even know what I was writing about. It takes being in my 50s now, and being married for 24 years, to look back and go, ‘Oh, man, I was going through some [stuff].’ “
Thomas admitted it was a no-brainer allowing his band's song to be featured in the Barbie movie, given his infatuation with the movie’s director and co-writer.
Jaap Buitendijk
“Greta Gerwig has been one of my crushes forever,"" Thomas admitted, ""to the point where I was on a plane one time and I called my wife, like, ‘Baby, Greta Gerwig just came on the plane, oh my God.’ So just the fact that it didn’t diminish my crush of Greta, that’s even better.”
“Growing up, I loved that song,” Gerwig said to USA Today, referring to 'Push.' ""I was like, ‘This is my rock ’n’ roll, Dad. Enjoy The Who, but these are my guys.’ And it wasn’t until college that I actually thought, ‘What is that song about?’ Just thinking about 13-year-old me singing along and really meaning it, I was like, 'That is so interesting.' I looked it up and, in a way, [Thomas] was playing a character. It’s almost like a story song.”
As for whether Thomas has any plans to see Barbie in theaters, he said, “I’m probably going to stream it on my bus when it’s available. … I'm excited to see two of the most beautiful people on the planet while I listen to my own song. That’s pretty amazing, in and of itself.”
Barbie the movie is in cinemas now. The soundtrack album Barbie: The Album was released on July 21. A deluxe edition of the soundtrack titled Best Weekend Ever Edition was also released the same day and features two bonus tracks, Gosling’s cover of “Push” plus a cover of the Indigo Girls’ “Closer to Fine” performed by Brandi Carlile and her wife Catherine.

At a private party thrown by Warner Bros., the last rays of late April sun flooded the Mr Chow restaurant at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas. More than once, as if choreographed by studio publicists, they landed like a spotlight on the perpetually smiling Margot Robbie. Executives from film studios and the toy industry swarmed the blond actress, who plays the title role in Barbie, a film from director Greta Gerwig that will be released in the US on July 21. David Zaslav, chief executive officer of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., zigzagged his way, Barbie baseball cap on his head, through the crowd to get to Robbie and snapped a selfie with her. An hour in, Robbie and Gerwig climbed up on the bar to rapturous applause. Robbie called Barbie a spectacle and a masterpiece, saying it was the kind of theatrical film that had first gotten her into show business.
It was also a moment of celebration for Mattel Inc. executives 250 miles away in El Segundo, California. Since 2018 they’ve been carrying out a strategy championed by their CEO and chairman, an amalgam of tanned biceps and phosphorescent teeth named Ynon Kreiz, to reverse a precipitous sales decline by licensing the company’s intellectual property to most every studio in Hollywood. Gerwig’s film, a comedic, feminist, PG-13 take on Barbie, will be the first release for Kreiz’s “IP strategy,” and its most consequential—the dolls are Mattel’s crown jewel, driving about a third of its $5 billion in annual sales.
Still from Barbie.

While the IP-to-movie playbook is by now well established, Barbie still comes with plenty of risks. It could be popular with nostalgic adults but fail to register with toy-hungry 5-year-olds. Box-office returns could be poor, hurting Warner Bros., which mostly covered Barbie’s $100 million budget, and spooking the studios that are collectively funding or considering funding 14 other Mattel movies. Or the film could backfire completely. In Barbie’s 64-year history she’s been the face of dozens of TV shows, small-screen movies, video games and books, but she’s never starred in a theatrical release. That’s not because Mattel didn’t recognize the potential upside; it’s because the potential downside was financial ruin.

Barbie was created and marketed as a toy of special personal importance to young girls—as a prototype for adulthood, a projection of a future life. Introduced at a moment in history when girls lacked real-world examples of high-powered women, Barbie, with her bombshell looks and high-flying jobs, filled a cultural vacuum. She quickly became an icon and lightning rod: Mattel’s research has shown that her fame rivals that of the British monarch or US president, and she’s about as heavily debated. Past executives feared a major Barbie motion picture could provoke such a negative reaction that it would destroy the appeal of the company’s biggest brand. Moreover, few big-budget movies with women as the target audience are ever even made—Shawn Robbins from industry tracker BoxOffice Pro puts the figure at about 6% of films costing at least the $100 million Barbie did.
But sometime over the past few decades, the calculus changed. With Mattel long reluctant to modify its most successful product, Barbie’s high heels had fallen out of step with society. By the 2000s the doll was being viewed as a relic. Seven years ago, Mattel finally began making Barbies with more realistic body types, new careers and a wider range of skin tones. Sales rose, but it wasn’t enough to reverse Mattel’s decline—that same year it lost its spot as the world’s largest toy company by market cap to Hasbro Inc. It then burned through two CEOs, endured an accounting scandal and recalled the Rock ’n Play Sleepers sold by its Fisher-Price subsidiary, which have been linked to about 100 infant deaths. Mattel rebounded during the pandemic, but that boom is over, and its stock price is about 40% lower than it was when the new Barbies came out.

Reviving the leading 20th century US toymaker will be a tall order for a single film. But already there are signs Kreiz’s gamble could work: Viral paparazzi pictures of the Barbie stars filming on Venice Beach last year sparked a Barbiecore pink fashion craze, and the movie’s trailers have been parsed on social media with the intensity of a postfeminist graduate course. “It’ll be very hard to be on planet Earth,” Kreiz says, “and not know this movie’s coming out.”
Mattel might’ve been a modest producer of Lucite picture frames and doll furniture if it weren’t for Ruth Handler. Along with her husband, Elliot, and a business partner, Harold Matson, Handler started the company in a Los Angeles garage in 1945. Elliot was the tinkerer, Ruth the executive. After Matson sold his stake, she expanded the company by taking voracious risks. In 1955 she signed a contract with ABC to sponsor The Mickey Mouse Club. This method of pitching toys was then untested, but when Mattel pitched its Thunder Burp Machine Gun on the first sponsored episode, the product sold out.

On a trip to Switzerland the following year with Elliot and the kids, Barbara and Ken, Ruth stopped short at a window display. Before her was a Bild Lilli, a busty foot-tall blond doll with heavy makeup that was based on a gold-digging comic strip character. Made in Germany, she wasn’t for kids—rather, she was frequently passed around by men as a gag gift at bachelor parties.
Through the years, Handler had seen Barbara toss aside her baby dolls in favor of paper dolls, creating make-believe stories about their fashionable grown-up existences. Handler surmised that if she replaced those paper dolls with something Lilli-like, Barbara would project her dreams of adulthood onto the 3D model instead. Handler took three Lilli dolls home and created the first prototypes for Barbie.

At the 1959 American International Toy Fair in New York, Handler presented Barbie to buyers, almost all of them men, from retailers such as Woolworth & Co. and Sears. She later recounted how they told her that little girls were interested only in baby dolls that helped them pretend to be mothers. Plus, the dolls had breasts, which the men considered lewd and unsuitable for children. Handler argued that girls wanted to be much more than mothers and that the body shape would provoke visions of their adult selves. She left the fair with far fewer orders than expected.
Undeterred, Handler took Barbie dolls to little girls directly, commissioning a TV commercial that featured a line of well-dressed plastic models on a tiered display as a woman sang in the background: “Barbie, beautiful Barbie, I’ll make believe that I am you.” A male voice told kids that everything from a wedding gown to sunglasses would be sold separately. Girls walked into department stores demanding to buy them, forcing chains that had rejected Handler’s toy fair pitch to beg her for inventory. Mattel went public the year after Barbie’s release, and soon it was the largest toy company in the world.
With her hit product, Handler unwittingly created two vexations that would long outlive her. First, Barbie’s astonishing success helped create an expectation from Wall Street of unrelenting growth. The Handlers were later accused of gaming the company’s financial records to appease those demands, resulting in their ouster from Mattel and a no-contest plea from Ruth in the mid-1970s.
Second, Barbie’s uncontrolled ascent saw her corporate stewards telling every little girl, in her most formative and impressionable years: This is the ideal woman. Managing that responsibility became a permanent challenge for Mattel. Handler herself knew the market strength of prevailing beauty standards—after all, she’d modeled Barbie after a sex doll from a country that had recently embraced Aryanism. But she also knew that girls are multifaceted, at one point making Barbie one of the first female astronauts. For some educated stay-at-home mothers, Barbie dolls served as the working-woman role model they couldn’t be themselves.
As times changed, Mattel focused on keeping Barbie at the forefront of each era’s female-empowerment movement. In 1961 she got a partner, Ken, who in a gender-role-reversing twist was a supporting character in Barbie’s story, with no real ambitions of his own. She went on to become a surgeon, a corporate executive and a US president, constantly reminding girls in ads that they could be anything they wanted to be. Mattel’s aggressive marketing of the dolls and their accessorized power suits and dream homes helped push Barbie sales past $1 billion in 1992. Handler claimed in her autobiography that the average American girl owned eight of the dolls.
Barbie also helped Mattel take risks and grow. It created lines such as Masters of the Universe and Chatty Cathy and snapped up other corporations with hit products for children, including Fisher‑Price and American Girl dollmaker Pleasant Co. At the suggestion of executive Bernard Loomis, it experimented with using branded TV shows to introduce products, starting with a show in 1969 to accompany the introduction of Hot Wheels. (Loomis later coined the term “toyetics” to refer to a TV show or film’s suitability for creating and selling toys; his strategy spread widely in the 1980s after federal rules on advertising to children slackened.)
It took a confluence of events and trends to draw Barbie’s reign to a close. In the late ’90s, Mattel was being led by CEO Jill Barad, who had a reputation for being a strong steward of the line. With video games cutting into toy sales, Barad made the call to purchase The Learning Co., maker of the popular Reader Rabbit computer game, for $3.8 billion, Mattel’s largest-ever acquisition. But executives quickly realized their new video game subsidiary didn’t have any new ideas that might relieve its cumbersome debts. By September 2000 it had agreed to sell TLC to a private equity firm at a huge loss and parted ways with Barad. It then brought in a procession of male CEOs who struggled to stay at the leading edge of kindergarten girl culture.

Around the time of Barad’s departure, a Barbie accessory designer who was still working for Mattel brought a pitch for a new type of doll to a small competitor, MGA Entertainment Inc. Called Bratz, they featured different skin colors and hair types, making them cool and accessible in a way that Barbie couldn’t match. MGA put out the first Bratz in 2001, quickly racking up $1 billion in yearly sales and obliterating Barbie’s dominant market position. In 2006, Mattel sued MGA for the rights to Bratz, arguing that its designer had created the dolls.
As the case moved along, Hasbro and Paramount Pictures came out with one of the first toy-based blockbuster movies, the high-octane, CGI-heavy Transformers. Released in 2007, the film grossed $700 million worldwide and caused sales to skyrocket. A confident Hasbro subsequently made the case to Walt Disney Co. that it should win the rights to manufacture and market Disney princess dolls, worth $500 million a year, away from a distracted Mattel.
Mattel lost the Disney license, lost the Bratz case and seemingly lost all good sense. In 2009 it introduced a line of Black Barbies, incorporating accessories such as silver chains inspired by rappers, which some found insensitive. Then it gave Barbie a new career as a computer engineer, portraying her in an accompanying book as barely competent enough to find the power button and reliant on male friends Steven and Brian to do her coding for her. When Barbie accidentally uploads a virus to her sister’s computer with a pink, heart-shaped USB device, Steven and Brian fix that, too.
“We weren’t connecting to the culture. We weren’t even a reflection of what pop culture looked like.
Girls looked at us and said, ‘You’re not relevant’ ”
Girls who weren’t White, girls who used wheelchairs and girls with midsections capacious enough for a rib cage didn’t see their future selves in Barbie. And they had Bratz dolls and ones representing witty and powerful Disney princesses available as alternative role models—not to mention their own real-life, high-achieving mothers. Barbie sales fell every year from 2012 to 2015, slumping to half the $1.8 billion they’d accounted for at their peak back in 1997. Mattel’s board churned through one CEO after the next. When the company tried again to focus on high-tech toys, introducing a talking Barbie with Wi-Fi and an artificial intelligence device designed to listen to babies and respond to their cries with lullabies, parents found them creepy.
“We weren’t connecting to the culture. We weren’t even a reflection of what pop culture looked like,” says Richard Dickson, Mattel’s president and chief operating officer. “Girls looked at us and said, ‘You’re not relevant.’ ”
Kreiz became CEO in April 2018, at a moment that was both promising and perilous for Mattel. A mostly female team working under the code name Project Dawn had by then developed and released a decidedly more modern and less problematic Barbie. The doll now came in four body types and seven skin tones, and her feet were no longer permanently shaped to fit high heels. Additional inclusive designs, including Barbies with hearing aids and with Down syndrome, would follow. Parents liked the updates, and the doll’s new plus sizes meant kids wanted new accessories including a $30 car and $200 Dreamhouse, ushering in a modest rise in sales.

But other problems were brewing. Toys “R” Us, one of Mattel’s largest partners, had just gone bankrupt. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Attorney’s Office opened civil and criminal investigations into accounting misstatements made before Kreiz’s tenure, which led to fines and a management shake-up. And Consumer Reports obtained a document showing that Mattel knew some 30 infants had died since the Rock ’n Play Sleeper’s 2009 release. With a story soon to be published and the American Academy of Pediatrics issuing a statement saying the device was deadly, the company issued a warning about it, then later recalled it. Kreiz was hauled in front of Congress to explain, and dozens of families sued. (Many of the cases are ongoing; Mattel disputes that the product was inherently unsafe and is defending itself in court.)
As this was going on, Kreiz was simultaneously seeking studio partners for his IP bet. If it went well, Mattel would see a rise in toy sales, spinoff lines of toys and more films based on those, and on the cycle would go. Barbie was the most obvious property to go Hollywood. There was even a script making the rounds at Sony Pictures that had Amy Schumer attached, then Anne Hathaway, telling the zany story of a Barbie who’s exiled from her idyllic world only to realize the folly of pursuing perfection. Many at Mattel, including those who’d worked on Project Dawn, disliked it. “The Amy Schumer pitch was understandably more comedic,” says Lisa McKnight, global head of dolls and Barbie at Mattel. But the parody “didn’t feel as smart and as provocative as we would have hoped for.” Kreiz says he felt the script made Barbie the butt of the joke. (Schumer dropped out of the project four months after her role was announced, later saying in interviews that their creative visions had clashed.)
One of Kreiz’s first priorities was to meet with Robbie to suss out her interest in playing Barbie. Her agent worked for Richard Lovett, the co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency and a longtime confidant of Kreiz, and within six weeks, Kreiz was sitting at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel with Robbie and her two partners at LuckyChap Entertainment. He says that the discussion was “long” and “organic,” and that they were immediately on the same page about doing something unexpected and creating a “cultural moment.”

Lovett connected Kreiz with another client, Robbie Brenner, as a potential in-house film chief. Brenner is a powerful producer with a thick book of high-profile contacts, and she’d been nominated for an Oscar for her work on Dallas Buyers Club. When Kreiz and Brenner met, he detailed his plan to create a movie division with Barbie as the first project. They agreed that Mattel would be wise to let Sony’s option lapse and that Robbie was an ideal anchor—talented and consistently successful. And, of course, she looked like a Barbie.
After Kreiz insisted he wasn’t looking to make glorified toy ads, Brenner agreed to come on board, starting in August 2018. She held meetings with Robbie, who suggested bringing on Gerwig as a writer. Gerwig had been dominating the female-coming-of-age genre as both a writer and director, with Oscar-nominated work on Lady Bird and more on the way with Little Women.
With the stakes rising, everyone “kind of piled on,” Brenner says. She and Robbie flew to New York and spoke to Gerwig and her creative and life partner, Noah Baumbach, about a script. She says Mattel clinched Gerwig and Baumbach’s hiring by agreeing to leave them more or less alone with it. Gerwig told the executives “they were going to go off, and they were gonna write the story together, and we were going to read it when we read it,” Brenner says. “That’s definitely scary.”
On a podcast with the pop star Dua Lipa, who sings on the soundtrack and plays a mermaid Barbie in the film, Gerwig said her interest in working with Robbie and her desire for a challenge persuaded her to sign on. She described the task as a potential “career ender” given how freighted the dolls have long been. “Like, oh no. Barbie,” she said. “Where do you even begin?” But by the time the story was written, she’d grown so attached that she signed on to direct, too. “When I was writing with Noah, there was a point when we were making each other laugh all the time, and when we got to the end, we were making each other cry,” she said at CinemaCon in Las Vegas in April.
In the film, Robbie plays a Barbie who lives in a vibrant toy world filled with other Barbies of different sizes, ethnicities and backgrounds. To everyone’s surprise, she begins to question herself and discuss the possibility of death, leading her on a journey to the real world. Her existential crisis panics executives at Mattel, including its CEO, played by Will Ferrell, who screams at one point (in a conference room that strongly resembles Kreiz’s office) that he wants to force Barbie back into her box. Along for the ride is Ryan Gosling as Ken, who comes off in the trailer as good-natured but clueless, still bound by dated gender norms. In one scene he argues to a female doctor—whom he doesn’t believe is a doctor—that it’s fine for him to perform surgery without a medical degree because he’s a man. In another knowing snippet from the trailer, Barbie’s feet suddenly become flat, just as they did in real life, and the other characters gag in disgust.

“The first time I read the script,” Brenner says, “I was like: ‘Wow, wow, wow.’ ” Despite Mattel’s hands-off pledge, it did have a few notes, though. Dickson and McKnight flew to the set in England four times, to “sit with Greta and Margot and really work through some script iterations, and really talk through the significance and the meaning to the brand,” Dickson says. Kreiz flew out, too, and saw Ferrell’s take on him.
While Gerwig’s script has similarities to the earlier one, Mattel’s Barbie brand team saw an important distinction: The doll was no longer the butt of the joke. It was more reflective of their own experience, in which they, a mostly female team, had to agitate with their mostly male managers to change Barbie’s appearance and persona for years without success until sales collapsed. Kreiz says Gerwig was indeed interpreting what had happened with the Barbie brand. “We do enjoy self-deprecation, and we’re happy to play the game,” he says. To the extent that Mattel executives are the target of the jokes, it’s an acknowledgment of past mistakes.
That’s not to say the film will ignore Barbie’s formative paradox. Even as she works to evolve, she looks like the classic blond, pink-bedecked doll of yore. There’s some public mystery, Dickson acknowledges, around how the film and the brand can affirm such values as inclusivity, diversity and empowerment—“and then lo and behold, you have Margot Robbie” as the embodiment of the doll. He professes that the film will address the apparent contradiction. “Wait till you see the movie,” he says.
Then there’s the existential question for Mattel: Will Barbie sell toys? Demand for all toys, including Barbie dolls, boomed during the pandemic, but the industry cooled as lockdown rules were lifted and inflation and economic malaise set in. And while the average customer for Barbie dolls is 3 to 8 years old, the film clearly isn’t for kids—its second teaser trailer included a run of sexual innuendos about how various characters will “beach” each other off, foreshadowing the PG-13 rating it later received. Hasbro got around this with Transformers in part because the movie appealed to nostalgic dads, who in turn bought the toys for their kids. To turn the same trick, Mattel will need to overcome market research showing that, despite Barbie’s recent makeover, there are moms who still bristle at the mention of her, associating her “perfect” body with harm to their girlhood self-confidence.
A feminist and funny Barbie film is therefore not just an apology, but also a sales pitch. The trailer cleverly acknowledges as much, declaring that whether you hate or love Barbie, the film is for you. Schumer herself said on a talk show in June that Gerwig’s version looks “very feminist and cool, so I will be seeing this movie.”

Not to mention, the merch won’t be for kids only: Mattel already has $30 Barbie T-shirts and $15 mugs on its website, and it has more than 100 partnerships lined up. There are Barbie-themed rugs and a Barbie clothing line at the Gap, Barbie roller skates and Barbie dog hats.
Some box-office forecasts have the movie in contention for a $100 million opening weekend. If it becomes a hit, it will buoy the prospects for the 14 other films Mattel has announced. Upcoming releases include a Masters of the Universe film and a live-action Hot Wheels one produced by J.J. Abrams. Movies based on everything from Barney the dinosaur to Magic 8 Ball to UNO are in the works. Mattel even has ones featuring some obsolete IP, including Major Matt Mason, a toy astronaut the company stopped selling in the 1970s, with Paramount Pictures producing and Tom Hanks attached to star.

And if any of those projects sounds like a stretch, well, the expectation from Wall Street of unrelenting growth hasn’t gone away, either. By early last year, Mattel’s market value was sitting at $9 billion, more than double what it was when Kreiz started. With films in the pipeline, the Disney princesses back in the fold and thousands of layoffs completed, last February he declared the company’s turnaround a success and announced it was now in “growth mode.”
At least two private equity firms, Apollo Global Management and L Catterton, approached Mattel about a purchase, though the possibility fell through. Bankers at Apollo, for their part, questioned whether the IP strategy would return the value Mattel said it would, according to a person who was involved in those discussions but wasn’t authorized to speak about them publicly. Analysts expect Barbie sales to remain static in 2023, even with the movie bump, and Mattel’s market value is now down to about $7 billion.
Nevertheless, for Kreiz, opportunities abound. Perhaps he’ll succeed in creating Marvel-style franchises around Barbie and other Mattel properties, turning its customers from mere toy buyers into fans. Kreiz lists new TV shows, digital games and theme park rides as some of the other revenue streams Mattel could create in the wake of a box-office hit. Heck, selling even one Major Matt Mason product would be one more than it’s sold in the past half-century. The studios fund the movies, so the financial downsides are modest and the upsides limitless.
Before Kreiz’s IP strategy can go that far, though, the returns on Barbie’s big star turn will have to come in. “Some people say: ‘Well, we heard that before—let’s wait until you actually have something out,’ ” he says. “We’re about to.” —With Matthew Townsend",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvMjAyMy1iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbWF0dGVsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 20:54:30+00:00,Guest Column: How Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ Tends to Her Superpowers,'Tiny Shoulders' director Andrea Nevins discusses the themes in the new Barbie film.,"Greta Gerwig’s Barbie begins with a humorous — but nonetheless brutally fitting — homage to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. It features the same moment of sheer, speechless awe, but instead of a black monolith, the little girls who inhabit this planet discover a monolithic version of the original 1959 Barbie, iconic black cat eye sunglasses, strapless black and white maillot. Kubrick has said that his monolith represented a powerful and unknowable alien life form, a blank canvas upon which viewers could unleash their own powers of imagination exponentially more than a cinematic representation ever could. For the generation of little girls who wouldn’t be able to sign their own checks without a man, have careers beyond those ascribed to the softer sex, nor even keep their own names, the canvas for unleashing their imaginations was Barbie.
The gift Ruth Handler offered young girls when she invented the doll 65 years ago was the opportunity to imagine what was then utterly unimaginable: an adulthood of their own. Dolls before this were baby dolls, meant to allow little girls to rehearse the inevitable end of a woman’s story. With this doll, a girl could play-act a world in which she could be a doctor or an astronaut or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company (something Ruth was able to do by the ’60s, but she was a unicorn). She could even own her own dream home. And she didn’t need a man to sign her checks. She offered open-ended play, albeit with a close-ended, societally dictated, male view of beauty. But she was autonomous and it felt powerful.
Warner Bros. Pictures
This is the dream world Gerwig conjures in Barbie. In her version, there is a Black woman president, an all-female Supreme Court and even all-female construction sites. It’s also a world where women can be feminine and dress in skimpy sequins just because it is fabulous and fun and not to attract the male gaze. When Ken leans in for a kiss after a girls night dance party, Barbie not only has no interest, she has no guilt that she might have set herself up for this sexual attention just by being her exuberant, feminine self. It is a child’s version of what it means to be a grown-up. Yes, she looked like a stereotypical movie star, but she could do anything. There are no casting couches in her world, no doors being slammed in her face, no roadblocks.
Roadblocks exist in the adult world and that has been Barbie’s problem since the moment of her invention. As soon as the interpretation of her is taken out of a child’s point of view and is seen through the lens of an adult, everything changes. The doll instantly becomes not a toy but a symbol of all the contradictions of modern womanhood. As Gloria Steinem told me when I asked her why feminists detested the doll in the ’70s, a sentiment that has persisted, she said “She was everything we were told to be and were fighting against.”
And so it’s when the adult world intrudes into Barbie Land that Gerwig’s Barbie’s unshakeable optimism turns to existential dread. The dolls are only meant to exist to spark the imaginations of children, not adults, and the tear in the fabric of the universe is when an adult begins to play with the doll. The character Gloria (perhaps an homage to the aforementioned Gloria) is a working mother struggling with questions of meaning and self-worth as her maturing daughter begins to push her away. We see her daughter, Sasha, sending her big box of Barbies off to Goodwill. Sasha has reached the age when doll play is replaced by teenage rebellion. But Gloria rescues one Barbie from the pile.
She begins to play with the doll, imagining costumes for her that bespeak human mid-life crisis concerns, including Full Body Cellulite Barbie and Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie. And because an adult is playing with this doll, imbuing her with middle-age concerns, Margot Robbie’s Barbie, once obliviously happy, suddenly develops cellulite and is troubled by thoughts of death.
So Barbie sets off to try to set things right. She arrives in Venice Beach wearing her leotard and rollerblades and is immediately shocked by the danger she feels under the male gaze. Because of the ogling and sexist comments, she seeks comfort from a group of construction workers. In her world, they were always supportive friends. But she finds more threatening sexual objectification. Before blading off, she reminds them that their fantasies can never be satisfied because, as a Barbie, she has no vagina. This absurdly genius idea of turning the threat on its head by removing genitals from the equation is explored by several female comedians. One of my favorites is Wanda Sykes’ version. She asks us to imagine a world in which women could come home from work, pull on their sneakers, grab their keys, leave their vaginas behind on the bureau and feel safe to take an evening run through the park.
Another of Barbie’s experiences in the real world is her first glimpse of a postmenopausal woman. Barbie’s don’t age, so it’s foreign to her. She examines the woman for a moment and says in a manner utterly devoid of guile, “You’re so beautiful.” Barbie has only seen the world through the female lens, so her beauty tenets have not been shaped by what is aesthetically pleasing to men.
This deep appreciation for women becomes a valuable element when the Ruth character in the movie suggests Barbie could become human. This choice, at first blush, might seem ridiculous to many in the Barbie audience. Why would she want to leave such a magical place as Barbie Land? It’s the question Gloria is struggling with as well. Why would her daughter want to leave her cozy, safe childhood? Why would she or Barbie want to enter the adult world of women where, as she rants, “You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard!!! It’s too contradictory!!!”
It’s much easier to be a child.
But there is also something magnificent about becoming a woman, despite the continued limitations and dangers attendant in that. Barbie, having witnessed something we as women have been programmed not to see, not to value, wants to become a part of the profound affinity group that the shared experience of womanhood creates. We are not men. We bleed. We can gestate another human life. We can make milk. We fight for our reproductive freedom. We weather menopause. And we laugh and cry about these things on girls nights. And in this movie, in Barbie’s view, in Gerwig’s view, in Ruth’s view, womanhood is a superpower. Barbie decides to join the real world because she wanted the gift Ruth gave to girls when she invented the doll. She wanted to become the subject, the creator of the narrative and not the object. And Barbie, in her very first stop as Barbara Handler, real woman, tends to her superpower, because it’s the most important thing. She goes to the gynecologist.

2023-07-28 14:40:08+00:00,The ‘Barbie’ Movie Embodies Representation For My Brown Girls,"""Every second of the 'Barbie' movie resonated with me because our lives and stories were well-represented,"" LaWanda Dickens writes.","Mothering two imaginative girls, Jasmine and Natalie, I spent many years watching them play with Barbie dolls. Seeing their creative minds plan soirées at the Barbie mansion, towering in a corner of Natalie’s bedroom, was like watching a sitcom. Sometimes Ken and his friends were fortunate enough to make it out of the toy box to join the fun, but usually, it was all about the girls. From brunches to pool parties or road trips in luxury convertibles, my daughters’ dolls lived well and without limitations.

This past Sunday, Natalie and I fancied up in cute, pink dresses for a grand outing we’d been anticipating for months, the “Barbie” movie. She invited two of her own Barbies, Sasha and Marla, whom she and Jasmine used to play with, to go with us. During the drive to Malco Grandview Cinema & IMAX, she dressed them for the show.

Cruising down Lakeland to I-55, from Flowood to Madison, all four of us vibed in our pastel, floral prints while listening to Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Nikki Minaj, Ice Spice and Aqua. The only missing player was Jasmine, who lives in Detroit and had seen the movie three days earlier.

As we walked into Malco, Natalie and I instantly became participants in a cross-generational gathering of women with a cultural connection steeped in mutual stories and experiences. Each girl and woman self-represented in a communal fashion show featuring elaborate, colorful hairstyles; dresses ranging from casual to formal; Barbie T-shirts; pink shorts; and shoes symbolic of inclusivity—heels, Converse, sandals and combat boots. It felt like a pre-party before the main event.

The hype was on the button.

Every second of the movie evinces brilliant writing, critical consciousness and cultural competence. The story of Barbie is contextualized in such a way that every victory for and atrocity against women is equally exhilarating and exhausting.

Barbie’s world is highly functional, productive and prosperous when women are in control and in charge of their own lives, without interference from a fragile, egotistical and overly sensitive patriarchy. Ensuing feelings of insecurity and personal inadequacy trigger male aggression and a scathing attack on women’s personhood.

Most disturbing is the real-world setback of women’s rights playing out on America’s national stage and systemic sabotaging of decades of hard labor.

The most ironic point in the movie comes when Ruth Handler’s ghost makes the iconic statement, “We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come.”

As a mom, I watched the movie’s hostile-takeover scenes, imagining myself in my daughter’s shoes, young women stripped of rights that were guaranteed to me when I was their age. The clock’s hands should not move backward.

Through mom lenses, the “Barbie” movie’s celebration of women’s landmark achievements and the opportunities available to my daughters energized me. Positions such as president, doctor, lawyer, and journalist were not as easily attainable for women when I was Jasmine’s and Natalie’s age. Although the writers spotlight progress to an extent, they are creative in reversing roles, presenting a world that excludes men, while also reflecting the disparaging circumstances we all face when any group is the target of gender inequality.

Today’s Barbie Symbolizes Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

I’m old enough to have witnessed Barbie’s transition from largely static to admirably variable. As a girl, I didn’t own any Barbie dolls, just baby dolls, a problematic cultural standard once heavily forced onto girls, as addressed in the movie’s introduction. My mother didn’t have a problem with Barbies. Representation mattered to her. She insisted that all of my dolls look like me. To this day, I’m grateful to her for caring about my identity formation.

Where I was growing up in Brookhaven, Miss., a Black Barbie doll on a toy store shelf did not come a dime a dozen. By the time I became a mother, a more relatable Barbie had emerged, one that I, unlike my mother, could comfortably introduce to Jasmine and Natalie.

Fortunately, my daughters experienced a Barbie culture inclusive of not only skin tones in their likeness, but also varying hair textures, facial features and body types. More importantly, Barbie became a symbol of diversity, equity and inclusion, encompassing the lives and stories of women from an increased intersectional perspective.

“Barbie” the movie portrayed a group of women with lifestyles identical to Jasmine and Natalie’s Barbie dolls. Watching the film, I thought about my little girls sitting on the floor with Barbie clothing, shoes, accessories, sports cars and other luxuries scattered about.

At certain points during the movie, I laughed and cried, rejoicing in knowing that my daughters were doing more than just playing with dolls. They were creating a world that young women owned—their Barbies with no glass ceilings, no threats to their personhood. Sitting at the brunch tables, swimming at the pool parties and driving the colorful sports cars were professional Black women, happy and thriving. Through their engagement with Barbie dolls, my girls were creating a world that they were raised to believe is attainable for them.

Jasmine and Natalie are college-educated adults now. Neither is clueless to the obstacles set against them. Both are empowered to self-advocate and expect no less than what they have worked hard to attain. As their mom, I can say that every second of the “Barbie” movie resonated with me because our lives and stories were well-represented.

2023-07-25 23:26:55+00:00,"Indigo Girls’ Classic Hit Invaded the ‘Barbie’ World, and Everyone Is Closer to Fine Because of It",Indigo Girls' classic song 'Closer to Fine' pops up three times in the 'Barbie' movie. Emily Saliers says they're honored to soundtrack a doll's life.,"If you came into the “Barbie” film cold, expecting that if any song was going to get the most play, it might be Aqua’s “Barbie World,” you had a surprise coming. Turns out Barbie is a huge Indigo Girls fan — or, at least like a million women and some men before her, she likes to belt along with the 1989 folk-rock smash “Closer to Fine” in the car. The song pops up three times over the course of the blockbuster film, guaranteeing that there is going to be a huge resurgence in the real world of people singing about going “to see the doctor of philosophy,” even if they’re actually on their way to the beach.

Emily Saliers, who is half of Indigo Girls along with Amy Ray (and who wrote “Closer to Fine”), got on the phone with Variety from her vacation spot to talk about a licensing sync of anyone’s dreams. (“If you haven’t been to Iceland, I highly recommend it,” she said. “It’s mind-blowingly beautiful here, like nothing I’ve ever seen. Talking about ‘Barbie’ and getting to be in Iceland at the same time — no complaints.”)

You’re on vacation. Have you even had a chance to see the movie?

I just saw the movie. I just turned 60 two days ago, and we took a vacation and so we were in the Faroe Islands and we snagged three individual tickets that weren’t even seated together. There were Dutch subtitles. It was surreal. I loved the movie. I can just tell you it was a cultural trip to be watching it premiere in that movie theater, and I haven’t saved a movie ticket stub since I was maybe 6 years old, but I’m saving this one.

When a licensing request like that comes in, do you ask a lot of questions before signing off?

We always ask questions, and when this first came down the pipeline for us and it was “Barbie,” I said, what? I never had a Barbie, so I don’t know — what’s this all about? My first thought was, oh, gotta make sure this is kosher, and then we found out it was a Greta Gerwig film, so that immediately put us at ease about that knowing it would be subversive in many ways, and also really well handled. And when the trailer came out, our listening audience lost their minds. As a fan of both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, to see and hear them singing a song I wrote was just mind-blowing. It was a surprise that fell out of the sky, like a gift from heaven, for sure.

Did you know it would be in the movie three times?

No. Even if it had just been the trailer, it would’ve been thrilling. Then to watch and love the movie, and to have it featured so prominently as if it were part of what the movie was exploring, was just the biggest honor, but I didn’t know it until I saw it.

They must have asked quite a while ago, because the characters are singing along with it in the movie, so it’s not something that was just dropped in after filming, or could have been replaced.

They asked a while ago, but it wasn’t last year or anything; it was the past few months. So I don’t know whether maybe they just assumed, “Yeah, this is gonna be a no-brainer for them. They’re gonna really wanna do this.” And of course we did. And then when we found out that Greta hand-picked the song herself, everything was just like, oh, this is a tremendous gift to us. It just feels good to be part of this whole thing, and to be part of a choice that Greta would make purposefully is very validating and exciting and honoring.

Barbie gets more enlightened over the course of the movie, but it was interesting that even before becoming that enlightened, “Closer to Fine” has somehow penetrated Barbieland from the real world, breaking the metaphysical barrier between worlds. If you choose to think about it that much.

If Greta felt like this is a song that could have been in the reality of the Barbie world before it hit the real world, then that’s a lot. And then of course, Barbie and Ken and all of them are questioning: Who am I? What is my place in life? All the questions, and of course that song is all about asking questions. So, um, It’s wonderful that it, it had its place throughout the movie in the different contexts, like the real world Barbie land and, and it actually fit into what some of the movie was trying to explore.

You’ve said that the song is not about beating yourself up about not knowing the answers, or not feeling the need to quest for a single answer. This is a movie about an existential quest, and even though she’s singing it kind of in a carefree way at the beginning, it reflects the concept of the movie as a sort of coming of age story, or coming of mindfulness story. There’s the quest that begins with “does anybody think about dying,” and it sets that up to have a deep song popping up so early in the movie and then recurring.

Sounds like you’ve given a lot of thought, as have I, but that’s exactly right. If it has just been used as a singalong, I know it is a road-trip singalong song to people, at least of our era, who take it along with them, just because of what they tell me and tell Amy. But the fact that it was used as more than just the singalong song and that it does really touch on all the existential stuff that’s going on with Barbie and Ken and the whole reality — I don’t even know how to describe how that makes me feel for us to be part of that, in the deft hands of a director like Greta Gerwig.

And not to have it be too heavy, you know. Like, we always historically have just been dumped on for being too sincere or too serious or whatever. So I love that a song that asks a lot of existential questions, as you’ve said, gets placed in a film that’s asking serious questions. But it’s just so fun, so funny, so vibrant, so full of life — there’s nothing that’s a bummer about it. It’s just got an identifiable melody and a chorus that you can really hook into, so, structurally as a song, it’s something that you just can sing at the top of your lungs if you want to, even as you’re singing lyrics that you may not realize are pondering those things.

What did you think of the Brandi Carlile and Catherine Carlile cover version on the deluxe digital soundtrack? She’s of course one of your biggest fans.

Well, that was really came out of nowhere too. At first, you’re gonna either assume or ask, is this song gonna be on the soundtrack? And by all accounts it wasn’t gonna be on the soundtrack. Just a very short time ago, like in the past two weeks, Brandi reached out to us and said that they’d asked her to do a cover of it. It’s a beautiful rendition. I love that she did it with her wife, Catherine. And, you know, we’ve been on the path with Brandi for many years now, and she’s very gracious with the way that she says our music has inspired her. So it’s kind of like coming full circle.

But at first we were like, well, shouldn’t we do the soundtrack? But the people who put the soundtrack together wanted different artists covering original versions of songs. And it makes sense that Brandi is the one who ended up doing it, and in her hands of course it came out beautifully. We just gave her carte blanche and said, “Sing it with whomever you like. Take any approach you like.”

Do you have any favorite use that it’s had as a sync before?

It’s been used in various things through the years and some of them are things that I haven’t even seen myself. But of course we read what the script was gonna be. Every time you get a license opportunity, it’s really thrilling, and Amy and I have always honestly wished that we’d had more licensing. We don’t do commercials with our music. But we’ve always felt that we have plenty of songs in our catalog that would work well in different contexts. When that Kate Bush song came out in “Stranger Things,” it was like, I can’t believe they chose this song, and now this incredible generation of new listeners is listening. So I can’t say that I had like an experience with an earlier licensing where it was as strong and resonant as “Barbie” is. But every time, it’s exciting and thrilling because somebody’s created something, even if it’s a TV show like “The Office,” which is a very well-respected series where somebody’s making a choice to include one of our songs in a well done piece of work or art. I hope that people who see the movie get interested in the song and get their interests piqued, and then they check it out and hopefully from that point then they’ll check out the rest of the catalog and find some music that they can hook into.

There is a documentary coming out about Indigo Girls, which is excellent — we reviewed it on the festival circuit — and maybe this is almost like an accidental trailer for the doc, something which will be seen by trillions of people and maybe at least subliminally register with them when that comes out.

You’re talking about “It’s Only Life After All,” which Alexandria Bombach did such a beautiful job on. Going to Sundance and being in Tribeca, that was thrilling, and then to have Barbie on the heels of that, or in the midst of it, it’s kinda like, wow, I guess if you stick around long enough, something like this can happen to you. It does feel like a dream come true.

Any idea when the doc will come out?

They’re working on that. It’s a terrible time in the industry with all the layoffs, with budget cuts and things like that. The movie was stalled for a couple years during COVID as Alexandria continued to edit, but so they’re still working on getting a release where it can be viewed on streaming platforms. That’s what they’re working on currently, so there’s no release date for that, but it will have a theatrical release, too. I just know that Alexandria and her team are working, you know, tirelessly to get it placed so that people can see it.

Back to “Barbie” — did you have any thoughts about the film’s approach to intersectional feminism… being able to be subversive and have some heavy messaging and alsosell product at the same time? Judging from your response to the movoie, you might be a fan of sort of working within the system to get messages across.

I am a fan of that, living in the world that we live in today. I know that there will be all kinds of opinions about that. But for me, when you have a far-reaching opportunity to discuss feminism and to discuss questions, like when Barbie says, “I don’t want to be what’s created. I want to be a creator”… And even Ken says, “When I found out that the patriarchy wasn’t about horses, I kind of got bored with it”… To see a movie that’s really kind of a romp in many ways, but then is also subversive and makes you think — it certainly made me think, my wife and my friend and I. We left the theater discussing what was brought up about feminism and about the roles women been subjective to. But also then you have the creator of the doll — I loved it that Greta included her in the film at the end. It’s a thought-provoking movie and the intersectionality worked for me.

It has a subversive nature, but I mean, it’s very hard to understand why the right has had such an adverse reaction, calling it, like, uber-woke. I thought it’s a movie that everybody could watch and talk about and think about. … It wasn’t like everything was tied up in a bow at the end. There are still loose ends about those questions about how women are supposed to look and what their role is and what it means to be subjugated to oppression from patriarchy and all those really heavy and true things. I thought Greta did a very excellent job of walking a very fine line and including commercialism — because in the end, you can’t deny the fact that the huge capitalist mechanism is at work there. And if you accept the fact that that’s where we are and we have to ask the important questions within the context of all that, then I don’t think you’re gonna wrestle with the movie. But there’s no way you can have the complexity of this world and gender roles and then tie it all up and go, ah, now it all makes sense. It just doesn’t work like that. The most important thing is that it’s thought-provoking and questions are being asked.

Well, if it causes grown men to create videos where they’re burning Barbie dolls, then it’s probably doing something right.

Amen to that.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLXNvbmctaW5kaWdvLWdpcmxzLWNsb3Nlci10by1maW5lLWVtaWx5LXNhbGllcnMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LTEyMzU2ODAxODEv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtc29uZy1pbmRpZ28tZ2lybHMtY2xvc2VyLXRvLWZpbmUtZW1pbHktc2FsaWVycy1pbnRlcnZpZXctMTIzNTY4MDE4MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-08 18:52:43+00:00,"Bill Maher Blasts ‘Barbie,’ Calls Movie “Preachy, Man-Hating, And A Zombie Lie”","Maher maintains that, ""people who don't go along with zombie lies did not take some red pill - just staying true to CURRENT reality.""","Bill Maher took to (or X) on Monday to tell his followers that he had seen Barbie and promised a “review” to follow. On Tuesday, Maher delivered…sort of. His post reads less like a review than one of his biting closing soliloquies on Real Time — which it’s worth noting, airs on HBO, a corporate sibling to the studio behind Barbie, Warner Bros.

While admitting the film is fun, Maher begins by called it “preachy, man-hating, and a #ZombieLie.”

What, you ask, is a “Zombie Lie?”

Maher defines it as, “Something that never was true, but certain people refuse to stop saying it (tax cuts for the rich increase revenues, e.g.); OR something that USED to be true but no longer is, but certain people pretend it’s still true.”

In any case, Maher’s gist is that Barbie, with a main character who fights the patriarchy, is actually a few years out of date because the power structure of the world we live in is “not really any longer deserving of the word ‘patriarchy.'”

For proof, he offers the fact that the Mattel board is actually made up of 5 women and 7 men, not all men, as the film posits.

“Truth is, I’m not the one who’s out of step – I’m living in the year we’re living in,” writes Maher. “Barbie is fun, I enjoyed it – but it IS a #ZombieLie. And people who don’t go along with zombie lies did not take some red pill – just staying true to CURRENT reality. Let’s live in the year we’re living in!”

Barely three weeks into its run, Barbie has raked in more than $1 billion at the global box office.

Read Maher’s full “review” below.

OK, “Barbie”: I was hoping it wouldn’t be preachy, man-hating, and a #ZombieLie – alas, it was all three. What is a Zombie Lie? Something that never was true, but certain people refuse to stop saying it (tax cuts for the rich increase revenues, e.g.); OR something that USED to be true but no longer is, but certain people pretend it’s still true. “Barbie” is this kind of #ZombieLie.

Spoiler alert, Barbie fights the Patriarchy. Right up to the Mattel board who created her, consisting of 12 white men! The Patriarchy! Except there’s a Mattel board in real life, and it’s 7 men and 5 women. OK, not perfect even-steven, but not the way the board IN THE MOVIE – which takes place in 2023 – is portrayed. And not really any longer deserving of the word “patriarchy.” Yes, there was one, and remnants of it remain – but this movie is so 2000-LATE.

At one point the Barbies have to win over the Kens, and they are told to do it by pretending to act helpless and not know how to do stuff. Helen Gurley Brown called, she wants her premise back. Yes, that WAS a thing. I saw “Barbie” with a woman in her 30s who said, “I don’t know a single woman of any age who would act like that today.”

I know, I know, ‘How could I know about the patriarchy, I AM a man!’ That argument is so old and so silly. Of course, none of us can know exactly what others go through life, but I can see the world around me, and I can read data. The real Mattel board is a pretty close mirror of the country, where 45% of the 449 board seats filled last year in Fortune 500 companies were women. Truth is, I’m not the one who’s out of step – I’m living in the year we’re living in. Barbie is fun, I enjoyed it – but it IS a #ZombieLie. And people who don’t go along with zombie lies did not take some red pill – just staying true to CURRENT reality. Let’s live in the year we’re living in!

,"Barbie soundtrack: Billie Eilish's song floored me, Mark Ronson says",The Oscar and Grammy-winning producer tells the story of how he put together the Barbie soundtrack.,"Barbie soundtrack: Billie Eilish's song floored me, Mark Ronson says

By Mark Savage BBC Music Correspondent

Mark Ronson / Instagram

Ronson recently shared a picture on social media of himself photoshopped into Barbie's car

Fifteen months ago, Mark Ronson got a text from his friend George Drakoulias, the man who'd discovered LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys.

It contained just one word: ""Barbie?""

Drakoulias had been hired as a music supervisor for the Barbie film and he had an urgent request from writer-director Greta Gerwig.

An early sequence showed Margot Robbie enjoying her perfect day in Barbie Land, hanging out by the pool, surrounded by fellow Barbies and doted on by the perma-tanned Ken.

There was just one problem: The scene culminated with a giant, 60-person dance number... but they hadn't got a song for it. Could Ronson write one?

""The pressure was crazy because they were going to start dance rehearsals in two weeks and they wanted this big song that could potentially be a hit,"" he tells the BBC.

What Drakoulias didn't know was that Ronson is a huge fan of Gerwig and her co-writer husband Noah Baumbach. After a quick glance at the script, he agreed to help.

""They could have probably said, 'We're making a movie about Matchbox cars,' and I'd have been like, 'Cool, if you're doing it, it's gonna be great',"" he laughs.

With the deadline imminent, he got to work with Andrew Wyatt (with whom he won an Oscar for the A Star Is Born hit Shallow) and together, they turned in a big disco number, full of sweeping string lines and funky bass licks.

Gerwig loved it. It was locked in for the film.

And then Ronson faced an even bigger struggle: Taking the instrumental track to an artist and persuading them to sing on it, without being able to make any changes to the song's tempo, feel or structure.

""It just had the beat and the strings. There was no melody, no lyrics, nothing. All I'd written was the working title 'Tastes Like Barbie' because I thought that sounded kinda cool.""

His first instinct was to send it to Dua Lipa, whose Future Nostalgia album shared many of the same reference points.

On 31 March, 2022, as Dua got ready for a concert in Seattle, Ronson sent her an Instagram DM, inviting her to ""co-write and star"" on the track.

""Because Dua has such a voracious intellectual curiosity for art, culture, film, everything I just knew she would she would dig it,"" he explains.

""She said, 'Yeah, cool,' and she ended up coming to New York and we wrote the song together.""

Ronson's writing and production credits include Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk and Lady Gaga's Shallow

Gerwig was so impressed with the result that she asked Ronson to curate the entire soundtrack... and then to score the film as well.

Her pitch was that Barbie's story was a parallel to the Bee Gees in the 1970s. Back then, the British trio were the most popular band in the world and Saturday Night Fever was the biggest-selling album of all time.

Then, in 1979 the ""Disco sucks"" movement culminated in Disco Demolition Night, where a local DJ called on listeners to destroy disco records in a Chicago baseball stadium.

The stunt was ugly, with undertones of racism and homophobia, and the Bee Gees were caught in the crossfire.

""They were interviewed a couple of weeks later and they were like, 'All we did ever did was just write great pop songs. Why do people hate us so much?'"" says Ronson.

""Greta saw a parallel with Barbie in some ways. The Barbie character, all she ever wanted to do was make people happy. But she also represents a lot of things that are problematic and really reviled.""

Watch: Feeling the 'Kenergy' at on Barbie movie pink carpet

Unlike previous films he's worked on, Ronson says Gerwig had a ""very specific idea"" of how the music would complement the action.

""No offence to the Ghostbusters reboot film, but I remember being one of 11 songs on there that re-interpolated the Ray Parker Jr. theme because there was no directive,"" says Ronson.

""But with this it's hard to tell which came first - the film or the song.""

Audiences can judge for themselves when the film opens on Friday. Until then, Ronson talks us through the soundtrack's highlights.

Lizzo - Pink

Lizzo's track opens the film, establishing the idyllic, pink-hued world that Barbie inhabits. But the chilled-out vibe is completely at odds with the song's frantic creation.

""We had two days, and we got nothing on the first one,"" says Ronson. ""I was like, 'Maybe it's not gonna happen'.

""Then she started freestyling and narrating, in a very tongue-in-cheek way, whatever was happening on the screen, no matter how ridiculous, like, 'Two Barbies, all dolled up and playing chess by the pool'.

""We just started laughing but then we realised: This is musically good, and this is fun, so we ran with it.

""I showed it to Greta and she flipped out. At that point, the song ended halfway through the credits because there's a Helen Mirren voiceover that comes in. But Greta was like, 'Tell Lizzo she can keep singing! She can sing at Helen! They can have a dialogue!'""

That idea never made it to celluloid, but it did pave the way for Lizzo to have another musical number later in the film.

Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj - Barbie World

Atlantic Records

""There were two things that were keeping me up at night: What are we doing with Aqua? And how do we possibly have the soundtrack without Nicki Minaj on it?"" says Ronson.

These were thorny issues.

Barbie's creator, Mattel, sued Aqua in the 1990s, saying their smash hit Barbie Girl had brought the doll into disrepute.

Minaj, whose fans are called Barbies or Barbz, was also deemed essential for the soundtrack - but she rejected ""a couple of songs that I didn't love,"" she confessed at the LA premiere.

The turning point came when Ronson invited Ice Spice to flip a sample of Barbie Girl.

""She's the most exciting new thing in rap,"" says Ronson. ""She's keeping New York alive.""

Along with her producer, RIOTUSA, she took Aqua singer Lene Nystrøm's iconic ""life in plastic"" hook and stapled it into a dark, New Jersey House beat.

""I loved it,"" said Minaj, agreeing to the collaboration.

The only problem was fitting the recording around Ronson's schedule.

""Ice Spice was supposed to come to my studio at 9pm and, you know, I'm an old guy with a brand new baby,"" he says.

""I waited till 11pm sharp, then I got into bed - but when I looked at my phone, it said, 'We're on the way'.

""I literally was in my pyjamas, but I put my clothes back on, rode my bike back to the studio and showed Ice and Riot the film. And the song started from there.""

Charli XCX - Speed Drive

Terrence O'Connor

Minaj wasn't the only one who wanted to cover Aqua's classic.

""Barbie Girl is such an important song to Charli XCX,"" says Ronson. ""She's told the story of singing it in a talent show when she was four. And she did a draft of it, but then she wrote the Speed Drive song, and it just elevated the film.

""We loved it so much that we said, 'Can we keep this?'""

The British star's contribution is a electrifying jolt of hyperpop that somehow combines elements of Tony Basil's cheerleader anthem Hey Mickey with Robyn's version of Cobrastyle, an underground rap track originally performed by Swedish band Teddybears.

But her version of Barbie Girl has subsequently leaked - with producer AG Cook playing it at one of his recent DJ sets.

Sam Smith - Man I Am

Getty Images

Sung from the point-of-view of Barbie's much-maligned boyfriend Ken, this Sam Smith track is a delicious deconstruction of hot, simple himbos.

""No I'm not gay, bro / But I've been on that lay-low,"" drawls Smith in an uncharacteristically gravelly voice.

""This comes at a point where you really feel you need to feel the freedom of the Kens,"" says Ronson.

""Greta showed Sam the scene and they started talking about the feminist mystique and all these very deep texts that I know nothing about. So I just shut my mouth and listened.

""Soon after, Sam sent me a voice note of this incredible melody, literally just singing a capella, and it leapt off the phone.

""It's so much fun to see artists take some licence, and do things they might not do on their own records because they're writing in character. Sam's playing the Kens in the verse, then they go into this yearning Sylvester voice in the chorus and it just explodes.""

Ryan Gosling - I'm Just Ken

Warner Bros Pictures

...In which Ryan Gosling bares his soul (and his chest) with a show-stopping Broadway number about playing second fiddle.

""I'm just Ken / Anywhere else, I'd be a 10,"" he sings, before the song explodes into a Hair-style rocker, with guitars by Slash and Wolfgang Van Halen.

Originally intended for an (unnamed) pop star, Gosling lobbied to sing it himself.

He came straight from the set to Ronson's studio, with the producer transposing the track to a lower key, to make it easier to sing.

""But each time he sang it, I was like, 'He sounds killer, l think we can bump it up,' until we were back in the original key,"" he recalls.

""I was over the moon because, at first, I was like, 'Okay, maybe the song won't be as good as the demo' but in the end he exceeded the demo.

""And then when I first saw the film, with him actually acting out the song, I was like, 'Of course!' Because he knew that, at some point, he'd be acting out these lyrics, so he was already doing it in the studio.""

Billie Eilish - What Was I Made For?

Getty Images

Eilish's song cuts to the heart of Barbie's predicament: What happens when the world turns against you?

The singer, who's fought her own battles against public perception, said inspiration hit her ""like a tornado"" after watching a rough cut of the film.

Within 24 hours, she sent Ronson a text saying, ""'I wrote something today', with a smiley face, as if it was nothing"", he recalls.

""The next morning, we got this MP3 and it just floored us.

""I was like, 'How have they summed up the film so well?' Because by that point. we had Ken's journey but we didn't have Barbie's...",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFydHMtNjYyMjA4ODXSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRzLTY2MjIwODg1LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Greta Gerwig‘s cotton candy colored fantasy stars Margot Robbie as the iconic plastic doll as she voyages out of Barbie World into the real world alongside Ryan Gosling‘s Ken. Along the way, Barbie discovers that life outside of the Dreamhouse isn’t the progressive utopia she always thought it was — and Ken discovers something called the “patriarchy.” Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell round out the cast.

The rapturously reviewed film smashed expectations with its $155 million domestic debut, ranking as the biggest opening weekend of 2023, as well as the best start for a film directed by a woman. It arrived as a full-fledged phenomenon, thanks to the marketing campaign of the year and stellar word-of-mouth to match. There was also hype from “Barbenheimer,” the nickname for the twin release date with Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama “Oppenheimer.”

In his review of the film, Variety film critic Peter DeBruge writes that “Gerwig’s girl-power blockbuster offers a neon-pink form of inception all its own, planting positive examples of female potential for future generations. Meanwhile, by showing a sense of humor about the brand’s past stumbles, it gives us permission to challenge what Barbie represents — not at all what you’d expect from a feature-length toy commercial.”

,'Barbie' movie features Central Florida star who hopes to represent people with limb differences,"Barbie fervor has taken over the nation recently, but here at 1 Up in Orlando, there is a designated place to celebrate the release of the new movie.","Barbie fervor has taken over the nation recently, but here at 1 Up in Orlando, there is a designated place to celebrate the release of the new movie.

From Barbie’s kitchen to her couch, to her bathtub, 1 Up has it all. The arcade has an upstairs section dedicated entirely to Barbie.

That discovery has been the delight of Instagrammers and Barbie fans all over Orlando. Blair Hurley came with a group of friends to celebrate the movie release at 1 Up.

""What Barbie means to me is that as a girl, we can do anything,"" said Hurley.

For 1 Up Bar Manager Luke Horman, the best part is that the Barbie section of the arcade happened to already be there. The bar crafted special drinks for the movie release, and made sure to have plenty of people in costume, but didn’t have to add any new furniture.

""We’ve got a really good, Instagrammable place,"" said Horman. Memories as well – if you grew up on Barbie, you come in here, you’re like, ‘I remember a lot of this stuff.’""

But that isn’t Central Florida’s only Barbie connection. A local named Ashely Young plays ""Bionic Barbie"" in the movie.

""They reached out to me saying the Barbie movie was looking for a dancer with a limb difference, and wondering if I wanted to come in and audition,"" she recounted. ""I was like, ‘Yeah, absolutely.’""

Young was born without the lower half of her right arm.

She says on top of an amazing experience with the cast, crew, and set – she’s grateful that other people with limb differences will be able to see themselves in the movie.

""Growing up, I didn’t have any sort of role models or any kind of dolls that looked like me, so hopefully this next generation of kids with limb differences, amputees, they can see me in this movie and think this is possible for them as well,"" said Young. ""At the end, when we wrapped up filming, I think it finally hit me what sort of impact this is going to have. I just broke down and cried – a bunch of people hugged me in the makeup tent.""

With Barbie clocking in so far as the second-biggest release of the year, and a Rotten Tomatoes score hovering around 90%, you can expect to see plenty of pink for a while longer.

Steffani Ouano, another member of a group dressed up for the Barbie movie release has this advice:

""Be pink, be extra, just have fun. And be a great role model, because that’s what Barbie is.""

,Watching Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ movie with my 12-year-old son | GUEST COMMENTARY,"I am an advocate for giving a voice to the voiceless in society, however, the movie seemed to take advocacy to another place of demeaning men.","We took up the entire row “J” of the Senator Theatre in Baltimore, my 21-year-old daughter, her best friend, my friend, her 18-year-old daughter and my mother, all in our pink and glitter. My 12-year-old son, dressed in coral shorts and a salmon colored button down hawaiin shirt wanted to sit in his own row, a row behind us with his bag of popcorn.

I continued turning my head throughout the movie to see him, his reaction. He told me Venice Beach was also in Grand Theft Auto.

My son and I first were introduced to Greta Gerwig during a Baltimore snowstorm in 2016, when he was 6, where we watched “Frances Ha” on repeat, and sang David Bowie’s “Modern Love” until the snow melted, trying to do the running splits in mid air. Sometime during this snowstorm, saying the name “Greta Gerwig” turned into a huge tickle fight. It’s a name that even now when we hear it, we feel it. And her name became part of that moment in time for us when we were all snowed in, reading Jhumpa Lahiri, walking to the Indian buffet around the corner, and watching Greta Gerwig run through the streets of New York, practicing her dance.

My children and I have seen many of her movies, including “20th Century Women,” “Lady Bird” and “Little Women.” My son went with us to all the opening shows. He and I were her biggest fans.

As much as I loved the speech America Ferrara made about how impossible it is to be a woman, and as much as I loved Rhea Pelman’s part playing the creator of the Barbie doll, and the flat feet and thoughts of death and cellulite, I felt there was a part that went terribly wrong.

I am an advocate for giving a voice to the voiceless in society, the marginalized, the oppressed, and making the playing field fair and open to women. However, the movie seemed to take it to another place of demeaning men. I don’t understand why we have to lower anyone’s dignity to get to another place. I wasn’t sure why Barbie Land went back to Barbie Land with all Barbies in power positions of leadership, isn’t this reverse sexism? Isn’t this correcting one great injustice with another? This was disappointing to see — another excluded because of their sex.

I wonder what it would look like to have a world where we can see one’s gifts as their individual person, not as defined as part of their sex or race.

I had to ask myself if I would have had this reaction to this movie, if my 12-year-old son was not sitting in the row behind me, isolating himself from all the pink. I think I would have, because I am a mother of a 12-year-old boy.

And even though the entire drive home, my son tried to name a job that only a woman can have, a job that excludes men, and he could not think of one, I still do not know how demeaning any sex or race makes it more of a humane world.

,America Ferrera's 'Barbie' speech said what all women are thinking and quickly went viral,"Moviegoers are applauding America Ferrera and her blistering monologue in ""Barbie,"" which gets at the ""impossible"" double standards that women face.","Spoiler alert! The following post contains important plot details about ""Barbie"" (in theaters now).

For all its jokes about beach, fascists and Proust, there's one moment in the ""Barbie"" movie that has people talking more than any other.

In the film's third act, Mattel employee Gloria (America Ferrera) travels back to Barbie Land with Barbie (Margot Robbie), where they discover that Ken (Ryan Gosling) has overthrown the all-female Supreme Court and plans to change the Constitution so that men have all the power. Tired of feeling like a mere accessory, Ken rejects Barbie's pleas to restore order, forcing all the other Barbies into a life of brainwashed servitude to the Kens.

Feeling deflated and defeated, Barbie breaks down crying in a meeting with Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) and other rejected dolls. There, Gloria offers a powerful speech about the unrealistic expectations that all women are held to, whether they're in the real world or plastic Dreamhouses.

Spoilers!Greta Gerwig talks 'emotional' final 'Barbie' line, creator Ruth Handler

What does America Ferrera say in her full 'Barbie' monologue?

""It is literally impossible to be a woman,"" Gloria tells Barbie. ""You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we’re always doing it wrong.

""You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can’t ask for money because that’s crass. You have to be a boss, but you can’t be mean. You have to lead, but you can’t squash other people’s ideas. You’re supposed to love being a mother, but don’t talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman, but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men’s bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you’re accused of complaining.

""You’re supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you’re supposed to be a part of the sisterhood. But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard! It’s too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.

""I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us,"" Gloria concludes. ""And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don’t even know.""

'Barbie' music:Matchbox Twenty thought they’d be ‘the butt of the joke’ with Ken’s ‘Push’ cover

'Barbie' fans have praised the speech as 'relatable' and 'Oscar-worthy'

Inspiring yet simmering with rage, the speech has resonated strongly with moviegoers ever since ""Barbie"" arrived in theaters last weekend. Women and men have tweeted that the scene made them cry, and said it even earned applause at many screenings.

Others are saying that Ferrera deserves a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for her brilliant and beautiful delivery of the monologue.

The scene encapsulates what Robbie finds so remarkable about writer/director Greta Gerwig, whose compassion radiates off the screen in ""Lady Bird"" (2017) and ""Little Women"" (2019).

""There's an expectation that Barbie, you just immediately (associate) it with superficiality,"" Robbie told USA TODAY prior to the Screen Actors Guild strike. But with Gerwig at the helm, the actress knew she would ""do her magic, and make this somehow so dimensional and unexpected, and so moving and emotional.""

2023-07-28 02:00:00+00:00,When Barbie gets political,"Rishi Sunak picks Barbie and Ken for his family, but the American right is absolutely furious about the hit movie.","Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

Welcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column.

An entirely plastic figure with no obvious genitalia and a blank expression who lives in a fabricated world … but enough about Donald Trump, let’s talk about Barbie.

Anything as popular as the Barbie movie has to get political, and that is what’s happened. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that his family had chosen “Barbie” ahead of the other big cinema release, “Oppenheimer.” To be fair, Sunak has young daughters and the codes to actual nuclear weapons, so it was always likely to be “Barbie” that he chose to see first.

Hopefully, Sunak’s children haven’t seen the posters that have been popping up in London that cast senior members of the Conservative Party as characters in the Barbie film alongside attacks on their positions on immigration and a variation on the hashtag “ThisBarbieIs…” that ends with a word beginning with C that isn’t exactly wholesome or suitable for a family publication (if indeed this is a family publication).

Not everyone is as pro-“Barbie” as Sunak. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, announced that he wouldn’t be going to see the movie, without specifying why. Germany was of course home to the Lilli doll, believed to be the inspiration for Barbie but which was a bigger, more curvaceous version of the American product and which originated on the pages of Bild (the bigger, more curvaceous version of this publication).

Also unhappy at “Barbie” was an American right-wing commentator, the permanently furious Ben Shapiro, who posted a 43-minute-long video (the film itself is only 113 minutes!) complaining about it.

“My producers dragged me to see ‘Barbie’ and it was one of the most woke movies I have ever seen,” Shapiro said, before adding: “Let me begin with my generalized assessment of the movie. This movie is not just a piece of shit. This movie is a flaming piece of dogshit, piled atop an entire dumpster on fire, piled atop a landfill filled with dogshit.”

Shapiro — who, lest you forget, is an actual adult — also threw a Barbie doll into a bin on top of some other Barbie dolls and set them on fire.

It was perhaps the oddest meltdown by someone from the American right since Tucker Carlson devoted an entire section of his TV show to complaining that M&Ms had gone woke and redesigned the cartoons used to advertise the candy to be “less sexy,” with the Green M&M swapping her boots for sneakers. That of course prompted the sadly unanswered question: “Does Tucker Carlson fancy multicolored button-shaped chocolate?”

In several interviews before the comedy’s theatrical release, Gerwig revealed that it was suggested she cut out the scene where Barbie (Margot Robbie) meets an elderly woman on a bench and tells her she’s beautiful.

“I love that scene so much,” Gerwig told Rolling Stone. “And the older woman on the bench is the costume designer Ann Roth. She’s a legend. It’s a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way — it doesn’t lead anywhere. And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, ‘Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.’ And I said, ‘If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about.'”

“That’s how I saw it. To me, this is the heart of the movie,” she continued. “The way Margot plays that moment is so gentle and so unforced. There’s the more outrageous elements in the movie that people say, ‘Oh, my God, I can’t believe Mattel let you do this,’ or, ‘I can’t believe Warner Bros. let you do this.’ But to me, the part that I can’t believe that is still in the movie is this little cul-de-sac that doesn’t lead anywhere — except for, it’s the heart of the movie.”

The scene with the elderly woman has nothing to do with the plot of the movie, per se, but it’s vital to understanding Barbie’s perception of the real world after she leaves the perfect utopia that is Barbieland.

“The idea of a loving God who’s a mother, a grandmother — who looks at you and says, ‘Honey, you’re doing ok’ — is something I feel like I need and I wanted to give to other people,” Gerwig added to The New York Times about the importance of the scene, which she describes as a “transaction of grace.”

“If I cut that scene, I don’t know why I’m making this movie,” Gerwig added. “If I don’t have that scene, I don’t know what it is or what I’ve done.”

Executives also tried to get a scene from the movie removed where a teenager eviscerates Barbie to her face. A cover story from Time magazine on the making of “Barbie” revealed that Mattel president and COO Richard Dickson flew to the movie’s London set at one point during production to argue with Gerwig and Robbie about the scene because he believed it was off-brand for the company. The director and her star convinced Dickson to keep the scene in the film by performing it for him live on set.

“When you look on the page, the nuance isn’t there, the delivery isn’t there,” Robbie said.

“Barbie” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Warner Bros.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLWN1dC1zY2VuZS1ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWctcmVmdXNlZC1yZW1vdmUtb2xkLXdvbWFuLWJlbmNoLXNjZW5lLTEyMzU2NzY0NzQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtY3V0LXNjZW5lLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1yZWZ1c2VkLXJlbW92ZS1vbGQtd29tYW4tYmVuY2gtc2NlbmUtMTIzNTY3NjQ3NC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"'Barbie' movie hype could be 'double-edged sword' for Mattel, Warner Bros. Discovery","""Barbie"" is one of the most anticipated movies of the summer — and arrives at a critical time for distributor Warner Bros. Discovery.","It's Barbie's world — and we're all living in it.

Mattel (MAT) and Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) ""Barbie"" movie is one of the most anticipated releases of the summer — fueled by an intense marketing push that has included billboards in Times Square, Airbnb listings, and brand collaborations with companies ranging from Burger King (QSR) to Crocs (CROX).

The ""Barbiecore"" explosion, as it's been dubbed, has led to heightened expectations surrounding ticket sales for the upcoming film, which is set to make its US debut on July 21. Current industry estimates call for a ""Barbie"" debut between $80 million and $100 million with Box Office Pro expectations set even higher between $115 million and $155 million. Warner Bros. is much more conservative at $60 million.

Although headlines have focused on the boost the $100 million-budget film could provide toy maker and ""Barbie"" producer Mattel, it also comes at an important inflection point for distributor Warner Bros. Discovery, which has seen a string of box office disappointments as of late.

WBD's ""The Flash"" bombed in its theatrical debut last month following an equally disappointing debut of ""Shazam! Fury Of The Gods"" in the spring. Those double-whammy disappointments have added to concerns surrounding the future of the DC film franchise, which has struggled compared to Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The stakes are high even outside of the superhero genre. Paramount's ""Mission Impossible 7"" — despite nabbing a new franchise record — saw its $80 million debut fall short of $90 million expectations this past weekend. Paramount Global (PARA) stock fell more than 4% on Monday as a result.

If ""Barbie"" fails to surpass expectations as well, it will flash a warning sign about the vitality of the box office — and add further pain to Warner Bros.' film business.

""This is, sort of, the double-edged sword that sometimes the marketing is so good that it overshadows the movie,"" Marcus Collins, professor of marketing at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""People get so enamored, so excited about the marketing for the movie that they never show up at the theater.""

Story continues

Collins added marketing excitement relative to purchase intent gives him ""a little bit of pause"" regarding ticket sales as the bulk of questions on Google Search center on the film's promotion — not the movie, per se.

""Since the core product is the movie, that should draw a little bit of pause for the folks who are putting this thing in the world,"" he said.

There could be other headwinds for the film beyond oversaturation on the marketing side.

According to Box Office Pro, challenges include families not showing up due to the movie's more mature focus in addition to a low number of premium screens showing the movie, with ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission Impossible 7"" dominating that space throughout July.

""That not only lowers Barbie's potential average ticket prices, but — as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience — could have a negative impact on attendance,"" Box Office Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins wrote.

Another hurdle could be the stoppage of red-carpet events, press junkets, and promotional interviews on the heels of last week's SAG-AFTRA strike, which could negatively impact yet-to-be-released titles. Luckily for ""Barbie,"" though, the film was able to complete the majority of its marketing campaign ahead of the strike announcement.

,'Barbie' Movie Soundtrack: Everything to Know,"The Barbie movie soundtrack features Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and more star-studded artists. It debuts on July 21, the same day as the film’s theatrical release.","What’s a party in Barbie Land without a little music?

There has been a lot of hype around Greta Gerwig’s upcoming Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and its corresponding soundtrack is no different, in part due to the star-studded featured artists.

On May 23, Rolling Stone announced that the Barbie soundtrack was underway and unveiled the first round-up of artists featured on the project, including Dua Lipa, Ice Spice and Charli XCX.

At the time, two mystery artists had yet to be disclosed, leaving curious fans wondering who would round out the highly-anticipated project. (The final two artists were confirmed on July 6 and July 10, adding an additional two original songs to the album.)

The soundtrack is more than just an accessory to the film, it is a crucial element in bringing Gerwig’s creative vision to life. According to Robbie, there are lyrics that “add an extra layer of comedy” to the storyline.

“You’re hearing lyrics that are responding to what’s happening onscreen, so the music became more than just music — it became a device to enhance what the audience was watching and experiencing, and got to be the voice of the audience,” the actress told Rolling Stone.

Read on for everything to know about the Barbie movie soundtrack, including which artists are featured and when it was released.

The soundtrack, officially titled Barbie: The Album, features an A-list roster that was announced in several waves.

The first group of chart-topping musicians was unveiled on May 23. They included Ava Max, Charli XCX, Dominic Fike, Dua Lipa, Fifty Fifty, Gayle, Haim, Ice Spice, Kali, Karol G, Khalid, Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, PinkPantheress, Ryan Gosling, Tame Impala and the Kid Laroi.

The second announcement was made on July 6, marking the reveal of the first of two ""TBA"" artists who had yet to be unveiled. Billie Eilish was confirmed to join the project, along with her brother and frequent collaborator Finneas.

“We made this song for Barbie and it means the absolute worrrrllld to me,” Eilish wrote on Instagram when surprising fans with the news. “This movie is gonna change ur lives and hopefully this song will too. Get ready to sob.”

The third and final announcement was made on July 10, confirming Sam Smith as the final mystery artist to round out the album. News of their involvement came just a day after Barbie premiered in Los Angeles.



“I cannot begin to express how incredibly excited I am to be a part of the soundtrack to this already iconic film,” Smith wrote on Instagram. “I was invited by the incredible @iammarkronson and Greta Gerwig to write a song from the perspective of Ken for one of the scenes and we honestly had so much fun with this.”

“I cannot wait for you to hear what we’ve created together,” the singer continued. “Barbie Land here we come!!!!”

Who produced the Barbie movie soundtrack?

Barbie: The Album is executively produced by Mark Ronson, who played a pivotal role in nailing down the perfect ""Barbies"" and ""Kens"" that would fit the voices of the soundtrack. His Barbie journey began after receiving a text from producer George Drakoulias, alerting him that Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were working on the film.

“Those two make some of my favorite films,” he told Time in July. “I thought, ‘Even if I don’t get this gig, I know this is going to be my favorite movie next year.’” So he agreed to the project, and he and Gerwig took off: “I became the Robin to her Batman,” he said.

Ronson also told the outlet of Gosling's involvement on the soundtrack, particularly raving about his execution of the song ""I'm Just Ken,"" a song Ronson crafted specifically for the actor.

""He was just nailing it because he’s such an amazing actor,"" the superproducer told Time. ""I hadn’t also figured that, of course, he would sell this song better than anyone because he is Ken.”

2023-07-04 00:07:41+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Has Inspired Movies on Barney, He-Man and Polly Pocket","'Barbie,' directed by Greta Gerwig, has inspired movies on Barney, He-Man and Polly Pocket","While the team at Mattel is busy decking the halls with Pantone pink, the Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie movie has inspired a running list of all things Barbie. From pool floaties to electric yellow Impala roller skates to shimmering makeup palettes, the forthcoming film has reinvigorated the company’s thirst for made-for-movie toy collabs.

In a recent interview with the New Yorker, executive Kevin McKeon revealed that a film on Barney, the purple dinosaur, is on its way. Daniel Kaluuya is slated to produce the movie, which McKeon described as an “A24-type” made for adults.

“We’re leaning into the millennial angst of the property rather than fine-tuning this for kids,” said the exec, who compared the film to work by Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze. “It’s really a play for adults. Not that it’s R-rated, but it’ll focus on some of the trials and tribulations of being thirty-something, growing up with Barney—just the level of disenchantment within the generation.”

He-Man and Polly Pocket are among thirteen other films that have been announced, per the New Yorker, while 45 more projects are in development. Tom Hanks is reportedly set to star in Major Matt Mason, the inspiration behind Pixar’s Buzz Lightyear based on the action figure first introduced in the Sixties.

In 2020, Kaluuya spoke with Entertainment Weekly and discussed the more “heartbreaking” aspects of the Barney narrative.

“Barney taught us, ‘I love you, you love me. Won’t you say you love me too?’ That’s one of the first songs I remember, and what happens when that isn’t true?,” he told the outlet. “I thought that was really heartbreaking. I have no idea why but it feels like that makes sense. It feels like there’s something unexpected that can be poignant but optimistic. Especially at this time now, I think that’s really, really needed.”

A similar theme runs through Barbie, as Gerwig previously told Rolling Stone, she thinks of the film “as humanist above anything else.” Trending Hunter Biden Offers to Testify Publicly.

“How Barbie operates in Barbieland is she’s entirely continuous with her environment. Even the houses have no walls, because you never need to hide because there’s nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed of,” she said. “And suddenly finding yourself in the real world and wishing you could hide, that’s the essence of being human.”

2023-07-13 05:30:00-04:00,Could the Barbie Movie Be a Massive Game Changer for Mattel Stock?,Mattel shares have been on the rise.,"Mattel (MAT 1.12%) stock has climbed 20% this year. Despite today's tough economic environment, the toy maker has managed to increase market share and confirm the strength of its top brands, such as Barbie. And speaking of the world's most famous doll, she's about to hit the big screen in her very own live-action movie.

The movie, Barbie, is set for release on July 21. Meanwhile, Mattel has been increasing its promotional activities to get everyone excited about the event -- and the doll.

Though Mattel shares have gained this year, they're still far from the record highs of about a decade ago. Could the new movie be the catalyst Mattel stock needs to return to those levels?

Barbie, the doll

First, let's talk about Barbie, the doll. She's won over kids for decades with her fun accessories and clothing -- and the world Mattel has built for her. I'm talking about everything from the hair salon and Dreamhouse to Barbies reflecting the kids and adults around us. Earlier this year, Mattel released its first Barbie with Down syndrome ""to allow even more children to see themselves in Barbie,"" the company said.

This strategy has worked. Barbie today is the No. 1 doll worldwide, according to consumer research firm Circana. And Mattel isn't just counting on Barbie appealing to children: Adults also love Barbie. (As someone who wouldn't dream of giving away her Barbie collection, I can tell you this firsthand.)

It's no surprise, then, that Mattel supported the idea of a Barbie movie that doesn't target kids, the main audience for Barbie dolls. After all, the movie Barbie is rated PG-13 in the U.S.

Mattel said in its first-quarter earnings call that the Barbie brand continues to hold a lot of potential, thanks to the core audience of children who play with the doll -- and the older audience who collect Barbies.

The youngest Barbie fans won't be rushing to theaters later this month. But many of the former kids who played with Barbie might -- and they also might then buy merchandise from clothing to dolls inspired by the movie. A quick look at Mattel Creations -- the company's e-commerce platform targeting collectors -- shows that certain items linked to the movie already are sold out.

Mattel said any licensing opportunities are all margin accretive. This means they'll gradually add to the profit that the company makes from its intellectual property.

Top 3 brands

It's clear Barbie, the movie, could result in a sales boost for Mattel. But could it truly be a game changer for the stock?

Barbie is a major product at Mattel. It's one of the company's top three brands along with Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. But it's still key to look at the company as a whole -- and not just focus on one brand.

In the most recent earnings report, Mattel's revenue fell as toy retailers struggled with inventory levels. Retailers started the year with too much inventory -- and this meant they didn't order more items from toy makers. Higher costs also hurt Mattel's bottom line.

These are temporary challenges, though. It's important to look at Mattel through a long-term lens -- and when you do, the view is brighter. Even though earnings have come down from a peak, they've generally grown over the past few years. Return on invested capital also has increased, showing Mattel's investments are paying off.

Mattel buys back shares

The company also recently began repurchasing its own shares for the first time in nine years. This is a clear sign that Mattel is confident about its future. The company says it will buy back more shares this year. Its current authorization allows for buybacks of $169 million.

Meanwhile, the stock is trading for only 14 times forward earnings estimates. This looks cheap considering the company's earnings track record -- and prospects, thanks to its strong portfolio of brands.

That brings us back to Barbie, the top brand. Barbie, the movie, won't be a game changer for Mattel by itself. The stock isn't likely to soar overnight and reach its peak levels.

But the movie could offer revenue a lift -- and amid today's vast selection of toys, it could help Barbie stand out. So, Barbie may add to Mattel's positive long-term picture. And that means right now may be a great time to get in on this top consumer goods stock.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA3LzEzL2NvdWxkLWJhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1iZS1nYW1lLWNoYW5nZXItZm9yLW1hdHRlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-13 15:00:00+00:00,The Hidden Significance of Margot Robbie's Yellow Dress in the Barbie Movie,The draping of the dress is very intentional.,"Spoilers ahead for the Barbie movie!

In one of the final scenes of Barbie, Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie is grappling with a choice: to stay in Barbieland or become a real human.

She decides to leave—while wearing a custom pale yellow dress that has a deeper meaning. The dress Barbie wears is meant to represent change, Barbie's costume designer Jacqueline Durran explains. ""The Barbies have gone through all of that stuff and they’re now the most fulfilled versions of themselves,"" Durran tells Variety. ""And that sets the scene for what’s happening to Margot’s Barbie as she’s becoming human.""

She adds, ""I was keen to track the history of Mattel in the costumes. I asked them what was the most popular costume in the last 5 to 10 years. It turns out it’s a yellow dress. I was going to copy that dress, but it wouldn’t really be recognizable enough.""

The yellow Durran picked was intentional, to contrast the bright pinks of earlier outfits. ""We wanted a soft yellow and wanted it to have less pop. So, we printed that yellow onto white silk, and because of the cut, it clings to the body,"" she explains about the dress. ""That’s not really a Barbie characteristic — the Barbie characteristic is to be cut straight and to create a shape that falls away from the body.""



And, the outfit is finished with a delicate Missoma heart pendant. Durran says this is intentional, too: ""Earlier in the film, she has heart accessories that she wears in the block party, and she has huge heart earrings, but there’s something about that locket and scale that makes it more human.""

2023-08-04 21:23:07+00:00,Why Does Margot Robbie Wear a Yellow Dress at the End of ‘Barbie’?,Costume designer Jacqueline Durran explains why Margot Robbie's Barbie wears a yellow dress at the end.,"SPOILER ALERT: This contains spoilers from “Barbie” which is now playing in theaters.

The yellow dress Margot Robbie’s wears in Barbie’s final scenes was designed to represent change, says the film’s costume designer Jacqueline Durran.

By the end of the Greta Gerwig blockbuster, Barbie has been transformed by the Real World. She’s become flat-footed, broken the patriarchy and all zen has been restored in Barbieland. Except Barbie, after experiencing the spectrum of human emotion, is feeling unfulfilled. She wants to be a human in the real world.

“The Barbies have gone through all of that stuff and they’re now the most fulfilled versions of themselves,” Durran says. “And that sets the scene for what’s happening to Margot’s Barbie as she’s becoming human.”

Durran says the costumes in Barbieland did not accentuate the softness of a human body. However, for the yellow dress Robbie wears in the end scene, “the costume is a bias cut dress which drapes — it’s not Barbie quality.”

The color also contrasts the pink-heavy world of the movie. “I was keen to track the history of Mattel in the costumes,” Durran says. “I asked them what was the most popular costume in the last 5 to 10 years. It turns out it’s a yellow dress. I was going to copy that dress, but it wouldn’t really be recognizable enough.” So she took the yellow idea and applied it to a drape cut.

Like many of the pieces in the film, Durran made the dress. “We wanted a soft yellow and wanted it to have less pop. So, we printed that yellow onto white silk, and because of the cut, it clings to the body. That’s not really a Barbie characteristic — the Barbie characteristic is to be cut straight and to create a shape that falls away from the body.”

Steering farther away from the looks of Barbieland, Durran used a wedge instead of a traditional heel. “We moved from the classic Barbie heeled court shoe into something softer, but at the same time we had to keep the heel.”

As for Barbie’s heart locket, “There’s a source of pathos in a locket that Barbie doesn’t necessarily have,” Durran says. “So, earlier in the film, she has heart accessories that she wears in the block party, and she has huge heart earrings, but there’s something about that locket and scale that makes it more human.”

And what about that cameo by Oscar-winning costume designer Ann Roth? Did Durran dress her?

“Absolutely not,” she says. “I contacted Ann through email and I said, ‘Just wear whatever you want. You’re appearing as yourself.’ She wanted to know about the scene, so I reiterated the positioning of the scene and the color Margot would be wearing.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXllbGxvdy1kcmVzcy0xMjM1Njg4MjE1L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXllbGxvdy1kcmVzcy0xMjM1Njg4MjE1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Just how much do you really know about this incredibly fashionable toy icon? Take a look back at her history to find out.

Is Barbie Based on a Real Person?

As revealed in Time, Ruth Handler, an American businesswoman, apparently got the idea for Barbie in 1956, when she spotted Bild Lilli, a German adult novelty toy based on a popular, rather saucy comic-strip character of the time. So, no, Barbie is not based on a real person, but her name was inspired by someone real (more on that later).

When Is Barbie's Birthday?

According to Barbie's official ""biography"" from Mattel, Barbie's birthday is March 9. The day marks the date back in 1959 when the first Barbie was unveiled at the New York Toy Fair.

How Old Is Barbie?

Mattel debuted Barbie in March 1959, meaning she's a ""senior citizen"" now, celebrating her 64th anniversary earlier this year. Since then, Barbie has become a cultural icon, spinning off numerous other characters along with video games, movies, books, and other content.

Barbie's actual age has varied over the years. She's been portrayed as young as 19 years old, but she's also famously depicted as a professional woman inspiring kids in more than 250 careers and counting.

Barbie's Full Name

Mattel gives Barbie's full name as Barbara Millicent Roberts, with ""Barbie,"" of course, being short for ""Barbara."" She was named after creator Ruth Handler's daughter, Barbara (and Ken was named after Handler's son, Kenneth). A second character, with the exact same name, was introduced in 2021. Dubbed ""Brooklyn Barbie,"" this Barbie is a Black woman who befriends ""original"" blond Barbie when they meet in New York.

Does Barbie Have Siblings?

In official Barbie lore, Barbie is the oldest of four sisters: Skipper (originally depicted as a little girl but now depicted as a teen), Stacie (officially 11 years old), and Chelsea (formerly named Kelly and depicted as being 6 or 7 years old).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2JhcmJpZS1mYWN0cy00OTIyODc2NtIBRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYmFyYmllLWZhY3RzLTQ5MjI4NzY2?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-05 18:00:00+00:00,Read America Ferrera's Full Barbie Movie Monologue,Gloria's speech about how it is impossible to be a woman is one of the most talked-about scenes from Greta Gerwig's blockbuster film.,"Spoilers ahead for Barbie.

One of the highlights of Greta Gerwig's Barbie comes in the second half of the film, when Gloria (America Ferrera) delivers a monologue on the impossible double standards of being a woman.

The monologue, Ferrera told Vanity Fair, was ""one of the first things Greta mentioned to me even before I read the script. She said, 'I wrote this monologue for Gloria, and I've always imagined you saying this.' While that was flattering, it also felt like pressure in the nicest way. I read the monologue and it hit me as powerful and meaningful. It also felt like, wow, what a gift as an actor to get to deliver something that feels so cathartic and truthful. But it also felt like this pivotal moment that I obviously didn't want to mess up. There was a little bit of healthy pressure around it.""

It took them two days to shoot the scene, and Ferrera says she probably did ""30 to 50 full runs of it, top to bottom."" Her favorite line, she says, is the ""always be grateful"" line, which she worked on together with Gerwig.

During her performance, Gerwig tells The Atlantic, ""When America was giving her beautiful speech, I was just sobbing, and then I looked around, and I realized everybody’s crying on the set. The men are crying too, because they have their own speech they feel they can’t ever give, you know? And they have their twin tightrope, which is also painful.""

Read Gloria's full monologue from Barbie (2023):

It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.

You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people.

You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.

But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful.

You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.

I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9sZWlzdXJlL2FydHMtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvYTQ0NzI1MDMwL2FtZXJpY2EtZmVycmVyYS1iYXJiaWUtZnVsbC1tb25vbG9ndWUtdHJhbnNjcmlwdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

It’s not often that social media and body positivity go hand-in-hand, but thanks to Barbie that may be about to change.

Many women have said that a scene in the recent Greta Gerwig film has changed the way they feel about TikTok’s aging filter.

Unless you have been living under a rock for the last month, you are probably pretty familiar with the viral TikTok filter.

According to Insider, an estimated 16 million videos have been made using the filter which shows an aged version of those on screen.

Sadly, most people have been reacting pretty poorly to the viral trend, and even celebrities like Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner have been upset by the way they look.

This may be about to change though as a scene in the Barbie movie has reminded audiences about the beauty in getting older.

In fact, in one of the film's final scenes, Margot Robbie's Barbie breaks down in tears upon seeing an old woman - played by costume designer Ann Roth - for the first time.

She sweetly says: ""You're so beautiful,"" and without hesitation, the elderly stranger replies: ""I know it!""

The touching moment has caused many women to rethink how they reacted to the TikTok trend, which some even re-recording their original videos.

It’s pretty heartwarming stuff, with multiple women reacting to themselves aged up alongside Billie Eilish’s tear-jerking track ‘What was I made for?’.

One user, @sav.sun, uploaded a video about the new trend, writing: ""Revisiting this filter after seeing Barbie, thinking of the 'you're so beautiful' scene, and realizing this face isn't so bad after all.""

The short clip has gained over 2 million views, with many other women also revealing that they had similarly emotional responses to the trend after seeing Barbie.

Another TikToker, @emilysbookishlife, uploaded her reaction to the aging filter and spoke about how she now ‘loves' seeing her aged alter-ego.

“My view of the filter did a complete 180 after seeing Barbie. I love her,” she gushed.

Meanwhile, a third admitted that she’d been completely ‘overwhelmed’ when she redid the trend.

“I saw someone say to do this filter after seeing the Barbie movie…and I’m overwhelmed,” revealed @amandathedietitian, saying she cried when she redid the viral trend.

2023-07-19 15:25:00+00:00,Greta Gerwig's Barbie Is Already The Biggest Film This Year,"Barbie has already stolen the hearts of social media with perhaps the best marketing we’ve seen for a movie in a long time. We’ve gotten picturesque stills of BarbieLand, the Architectural Digest tour of the Dream House, hilarious trailers, and of course the iconic movie posters.","Growing up as a girl, I played with all sorts of dolls: American Girl, Bratz, Polly Pocket, and of course, Barbies. I had the Dream House, the Dream Car, the color-changing mermaid . . . and let's not forget Ken. But as I aged, Barbie became more problematic.

Suddenly, we grew up and realized that Barbie didn't reflect the diversity (by any means) of our world very well. She was dimensionally impossible, but as we grew up she was our role model?!?! How could we spend our lives coveting a blonde-haired, cinched-waisted, pink-loving Barbie-life if the girl selling the dream was unattainable?

And then there were the controversial Barbies…1965 Slumber Party Barbie's scale was set at 110 pounds. She had a dieting book titled “How To Lose Weight” with the advice “Don’t Eat!” OMG - our role model was promoting eating disorder culture!

Mattel was failing to realize that by making Barbie a doctor, lawyer, homeowner, extraordinaire, she truly was our role model as little girls. We were looking at these dolls potentially seeing what our future could look like. And if it meant being 110 pounds to have the Dream Car, that sends the opposite message.

But there is no one I have more faith in than Greta Gerwig to do the injustices of Barbie justice. We have just under one month until Gerwig’s Barbie movie releases into theaters…on the same day as Christopher Nolan’s polar opposite Oppenheimer, which has started its own collection of memes for a double-header day.

Barbie has already stolen the hearts of social media with perhaps the best marketing we’ve seen for a movie in a long time (barring the accidental chaos marketing of Don’t Worry Darling). We’ve gotten picturesque stills of BarbieLand, the Architectural Digest tour of the Dream House, hilarious trailers, and of course the iconic movie posters. The main message of the posters? Barbie (Margot Robbie) is everything, and he’s just Ken (Ryan Gosling).







From the trailer we can tell that Barbie lives in her pink world with other Barbies and Kens, like Dua Lipa being Mermaid Barbie. But one day when Barbie throws her party (complete with synchronized dance and bespoke song), she lets a thought out: “Do you guys ever think about dying?” Party halts.

Now that she’s contempating her mortality, things for Barbie become less than perfect: her heels touch the ground (gag) and she falls off her roof (gasp)..So she’s given a choice: return to her world (presented as a high heel) or go to the Real World and figure out what life’s really about (presented as a worn out Birkenstock). Unfortunately for Barbie, she has to choose the latter.

In BarbieLand, she explains, “ Basically everything men do in your world, women do in ours.” As for the Kens? “I honestly don’t know.” If you can tell the theme of this film so far, it’s that women are running the show.

But what Greta Gerwig gets right with Barbie so far is that BarbieLand is impractical. In the Architectural Digest tour, Margot Robbie shows us how the pool is fake because there are no elements in Barbie’s world. She showers without water, has a fridge filled with decal food, and a lot, she admits with a laugh, is “not super practical, but nothing is for Barbie.”







The success of the movie already is proving to be major. With Ryan Gosling’s fierce dedication to being Ken, you find it hard not to root for this movie in the box office. He’s given us quotes like “If you really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken” and coined the term “Ken-ergy.”

On Jimmy Fallon, Gosling likened Ken to an un-cool accessory, saying that nobody really ever played with a Ken doll. “ I was surprised how…some people were clutching their pearls about my Ken, as though they ever thought about Ken for a second. They never played with Ken! Nobody ever plays with Ken.”







And we’ve already seen the blazing hot pink merchandise that has scattered stores. You can buy Barbie-inspired satin pillowcases, Barbie glassware, Barbie cookware. Our lives are suddenly immersed in our picturesque Barbie DreamWorld, but this time with a grown-up twist.

We’re no longer emulating the Barbie look, per-se…but the Barbie Dream. It’s about female empowerment and uplifting others, becoming successful in your own way, and loving the color pink always. It’s more of the Barbie mindset than the Barbie body.

With a star-studded cast consisting of Will Ferrell, Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, and more…and an equally studded soundtrack with features from Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Ava Max, Charli XCX, Khalid, Lizzo, etc. This movie radiates power.

As a lover of all things pink, I’m here for the Barbie collabs. Here are my faves to get you ready for the movie of the summer:

,"Your Weekly Roundup of Movies: In the Battle Between “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie,” Cinema Wins",,"OPPENHEIMER

**** At the start of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, raindrops fall; at the end, fire rages. You’ll feel it burn long after the end credits roll. Nolan has made violent movies before (including Inception and Dunkirk), but Oppenheimer is not just about physical devastation. It submerges you in the violence of a guilt-ravaged soul, leaving you feeling unsettled and unclean. Confronting the film’s moral and spiritual weight is a fearsome challenge, and one well worth rising to.

With agitated charisma and vulnerability, Cillian Murphy embodies J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist whose mind birthed the atomic bomb. When we first meet him, he’s a curly-haired lad staring at a puddle, but he swiftly evolves into an excitable visionary leading a cadre of scientists into the deserts of New Mexico, where they will ultimately build and test a plutonium device (referred to as “the gadget”) on July 16, 1945.

While Nolan exists a world apart from Oppenheimer—his creativity far exceeds his fascination with destruction—he has absorbed some of his subject’s frantic energy. Attempting to squeeze decades of a man’s intellectual and emotional life into a mere three hours, Nolan sometimes reduces moments to fragments, egged on by Ludwig Göransson’s eerie and pulsating score (which is excellent but overused).

What saves the film from becoming a connect-the-dots biopic is Nolan’s ingenious chronicle of the post-World War II rivalry between Oppenheimer and Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The more Oppenheimer fights to put “the nuclear genie back in the bottle,” the more Strauss seethes and schemes, thrusting the movie into a maze of double-crosses that echo the exhilarating games of perception in Nolan’s 2001 breakout hit Memento.

Of course, the thrill can’t (and shouldn’t) last. A decade ago, I applauded jubilantly as Nolan wrapped his Dark Knight trilogy, but Oppenheimer left me silent and still. As many as 226,000 people were killed when the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they haunt the film like ghosts—especially when Oppenheimer imagines a charred corpse beneath his foot. A man dreamed; people died. All a work of art can do is evoke their absence. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

BARBIE

*** Once upon a time, Barbie dolls liberated all women from tyranny. The end…at least according to the first few minutes of Barbie, a sleek and satirical fantasia from director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Set in the utopian kingdom of Barbieland, the movie dramatizes the existential crises of the winkingly named Stereotypical Barbie. She’s played by Margot Robbie, who was last seen battling a rattlesnake in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon—and her misadventures in Barbie are hardly less bizarre. Plagued by flat feet, cellulite and fears of death, Barbie seeks the source of her ailments in the real world, bringing along a beamingly inadequate Ken (Ryan Gosling) with catastrophic consequences: Awed by images of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, Ken becomes a crusading men’s rights activist, leading a revolt against the government of Barbieland and instituting bros-first martial law. And they say originality is dead! With its absurdist wit, glitzy musical numbers, and earnest ruminations on whether matriarchy and patriarchy can coexist, Barbie is easily one of the most brazen movies released by a major studio. Yes, its tidy ending betrays its anarchic spirit—after insisting that empowerment can’t be neatly packaged in a doll box, the film seems to say, “No, wait! It can!”—but it would be churlish to deny the charm of Gerwig’s buoyant creation. In an age when genuine cinematic joy is rare, we’re all lucky to be passengers in Barbie’s hot-pink plastic convertible. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Academy, Bagdad, Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Fox Tower, Laurelhurst, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, St. Johns Twin, Studio One, Wunderland Milwaukie.

AFIRE

**** In the tradition of his many compromised romances (Phoenix, Transit, Undine), writer-director Christian Petzold explores connections missed, made and retroactively illuminated during a novelist’s work-cation on the Baltic Sea in Afire. In black denim and gray New Balances, Leon (Thomas Schubert) is practically in uniform as someone who hates the beach. He’s destined to miss out, but the audience doesn’t. Petzold lets us enjoy Leon’s companions—his friend Felix (Langston Uibel), their unexpected housemate Nadja (Paula Beer) and a local lifeguard (Enno Trebs)—and Germany’s north coast. All the while, Leon frets over his manuscript, and a forest fire rages in the distance. Dreamy yet frustrated, blunt yet forgiving, Afire holds space for modern life’s many scales—a creative’s navel-gazing, less selfish characters’ acceptance of provincial life, existential dread. Reveling in Nadja’s beauty, intelligence and generosity (she’s always making goulash), Petzold keeps challenging the audience with Leon’s shaky grip on protagonist status. Often, this sour lump is the last character whose vantage point you’d want in this film, but that’s all part of Petzold’s ever-fascinating “both/and” filmmaking. People will still take meaningful vacations as the world burns; a bad writer can tell a good story; and Nadja will offer Leon a welcoming smile because they’ve shared a deeply imperfect moment. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE

**** Danger is a drug—and in his third Mission: Impossible film, director Christopher McQuarrie simultaneously shoves it up your nostrils and stabs it into your veins. As usual, daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is chasing after an explosive MacGuffin that he must protect from a doomsday-loving maniac (Esai Morales, in this case) lest the world go boom. Rather than vary the formula, McQuarrie simply refurbishes it (brilliantly) with fresh flourishes of suspense. You’ve seen Ethan race against the clock, but you’ve never seen him rushing through an airport in Abu Dhabi during a countdown to a nuclear explosion. You’ve seen him in one-on-one fights, but never with a demented French swordswoman (Pom Klementieff) in a terrifyingly cramped alley in Venice. You’ve seen him battle his adversaries on trains, but never run through one as it tumbles into…oh, just see the movie already, will you? Dead Reckoning Part One isn’t just cinema. It’s the essence of everything cinema was made for—not just triumphantly tense violence, but delicious glamour and sex appeal (a nighttime negotiation with Alanna Mitsopolis, a broker played with a lascivious grin by Vanessa Kirby, is nearly erotic enough to deserve an NC-17 rating). And while the apparent death of a main character strikes a sour note—these films work best when they’re disposable and delightful, not tragic and ruthless—I’m hopeful that it’s a red herring designed to goose our sympathies before Part Two arrives next year. It wouldn’t be the first time that a Mission: Impossible movie has manipulated its audience to irresistibly grand effect. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

PAST LIVES

**** As Nora (Greta Lee) is about to share a first kiss with her future husband, Arthur (John Magaro), she explains the Korean phrase in-yun—fate’s hand in human connection and reconnection. Intentionally or not, she’s referring just as much to Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), her best friend and crush from before she immigrated from Seoul to Canada. Ever since, Hae Sung has reappeared to Nora like a 12-year comet, and in director Celine Song’s Past Lives, Hae Sung visits Nora in present-day Brooklyn. Both unambiguous romance and genre experiment, Past Lives sustains itself on love’s textures and musings: endless gazes, mirrorlike skyscrapers, a twinkling synth score (by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen), and a vibrant but melancholy obsession with New York City. Gorgeous 30-somethings who can’t keep guileless vulnerability off their faces, these characters aren’t looking to blow up their lives for the sake of movie contrivances, but through every private conversation, they’re drawn to discussing the same narrative possibilities on the audience’s minds. Who is the right lover in a story sense? Even Arthur wonders. Are in-yun and Nora’s brief, almost multiversal encounters with Hae Sung potent enough to alter the years in between? And when she glimpses the past in his kind, mournful eyes, is she dreaming or seeing? PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room.

JOY RIDE

** In a seeming attempt to reflect the diverse array of untold Asian narratives—a shared pressure among many Asian American artists—Joy Ride accomplishes the opposite, offering a rushed 90 minutes overcrowded by underdeveloped characters and plot turns. Adopted Chinese American Audrey (Ashley Park) travels to her birth country for the first time, along with two eccentric best friends, Kat (Stephanie Hsu), a Chinese soap opera actor hiding her sexual past from her God-fearing virgin fiancé, and Lolo (Sherry Cola), a fledgling artist who makes playground models resembling genitalia to “get the conversation going” (Lolo also brings along her BTS-obsessed cousin, played by a wide-eyed, scene-stealing Sabrina Wu). Audrey’s business trip to China quickly turns into a cross-continental search for her birth mother, and the film sharply illustrates certain minority challenges—internalized shame, dissonance between internal and external perceptions of self. Yet its efforts to provide a comprehensive cultural education (the work of not one, but many, many more representative films) result in stilted dialogue and a hasty denouement. The comedy’s saving grace lies in its effectively over-the-top humor; filled with riotous bits and clever one-liners, Joy Ride promises to leave the audience feeling lighter than before they entered the theater. And, sometimes, that’s all we need from a movie. R. ROSE WONG. Eastport, Fox Tower.

QUICKSAND

* A bickering couple on the brink of divorce gets stuck in a muddy hole in the forests of Colombia in Quicksand. Carolina Gaitan and Allan Hawco play Sofia and Josh, health care professionals who have journeyed to the country to assist a friend. After going on a hike and winding up in an area they were warned about, Sofia and Josh end up in a fight for their lives. The two have to put aside their differences in order to survive the ordeal, but Matt Pitts’ screenplay never rings true as it jumps from scene to scene. Quicksand could have worked as a survival scenario crossed with a therapy session, but the couple’s conflict feels underwritten and their inept decision making makes it hard to root for them. Director Andres Beltran tries to overcome the thin screenplay by overselling many scenes with music and style; many sequences are well shot, but the messy editing often betrays the images. Quicksand does provide some minor enjoyment with unintentional laughs (some involving a snake), but most of the time the film is alternately boring and annoying. NR. DANIEL RESTER.

,Ryan Gosling Takes Family to Beach Amid 'Barbie' Billion-Dollar Milestone,Ryan Gosling hits the beach with Eva Mendes and their family.,"Ryan Gosling's still in Ken-mode amid 'Barbie's' continued success -- he took his real-life brood to the sandy shores of Cali ... and was leaning heavily on the matriarchy, it seems.

The actor hit up a beach near Santa Barbara Friday, and the whole Gosling household was in tow -- including his partner, Eva Mendes, and their 2 daughters. There were other adults tagging along, however ... including what appears to be somebody's mother or grandmother.

Eyewitnesses tell us Ryan was actually very focused on this older woman, helping her get through the sand in her walker ... and carefully assisting her down to the actual water.

Again, we're not sure who this woman was exactly -- but it could very well be Eva's mother, Eva Perez Suarez, who's been in ailing health of late ... according to her own daughter, anyway. We know Eva is incredibly close with her family, and also values privacy.

As for the other 2 adults ... no idea, but they were certainly rolling with Eva and Ryan, and keeping a watchful eye over the kids. Speaking of the two girls ... we're told they had paddleboards with them. And with Mama and Papa Bear -- they chatted, but no PDA.

Anyhoo, this really is an example of life imitating art. If you haven't seen 'Barbie' yet ... there's a running joke about Ken (played by RG) and his job, described as just ""beach.""

Seems like Ryan took that theme right off the script and manifested it in the real world -- only here, he's much more reverent of the women in his life ... unlike his onscreen character.

BTW, 'Barbie' is expected to cross the billion-dollar mark at the worldwide box office this weekend -- not to mention three-peating as the #1 movie folks are flocking to see. The crazy thing is ... there's no sequel in the works just yet, which is unheard of in this day and age.

Interestingly, Ryan and Margot Robbie didn't sign a deal for movie #2 in their OG contracts with Warner Bros. -- so if they do agree to do it at this point, they're in for a fat payday.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtei5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNS9yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctdGFrZXMtZmFtaWx5LWJlYWNoLWJhcmJpZS1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL9IBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRtei5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNS9yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctdGFrZXMtZmFtaWx5LWJlYWNoLWJhcmJpZS1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Britain’s biggest Barbie fan has spent more than £20,000 ($25,000) collecting 800 dolls, which have rocketed in value since the movie release.

Dawn Austin, 44, first became obsessed with the iconic doll when she spotted one in an airport shop when she was a small child.

She steadily added to her collection but lost interest as a teenager, until she fell back in love with them in her 20s when she became an artist.

Over the last 23 years, Dawn has scoured flea markets and online auction sites like eBay for dolls from her childhood.

She now has a staggering 800 Barbies as well as several Kens. She also has dozens of Sindy and Tammy dolls which are crammed into her three-bed terrace in Derby.

Dawn says the dolls fill almost every surface but husband Steve, 45, draws a line with having any in their bedroom.

She said: “One of my first memories is sitting in a pram and seeing this amazing toy doll in a shop window at an airport.

“I saw all these golden-haired dolls and I asked if they were fairies or angels.

“My mum took me over and bought me a Malibu Barbie and I never let it go. From then on I just wanted to collect them all.

“When I was a child, it was the scope for imagination and play. She could be what I wanted.

“I remember that Barbie was a nun, but she was also a farmer – she went anywhere that you could take her.”

While she was an art student in 2000, Dawn decided to collect Barbies she enjoyed from her 1980s childhood.

She added: “My fascination just snowballed. I would go on eBay sites and scour flea markets and thrift stores.

“Every time we go on holiday, I always scout out a market or car boot sale nearby.

“My husband Steve is very good. He knows how important they are to me.

“I have kept all the receipts for the dolls and I would estimate that overall I have spent more than £20,000 on them but for me it’s worth it because I just love collecting them.”



Since the Hollywood movie “Barbie” was released last month, the value in Barbie-related memorabilia has soared.

Dawn has now upped security of her most precious dolls, with some being extremely rare first editions.

The most valuable doll she owns is a 1960 model featuring Barbie wearing a black and white swimsuit and sporting a ponytail.

Dawn said: “I never really thought to much about the doll’s value but since the movie, Barbie memorabilia has gone up 25 per cent.

“I have become quite expert in what to look for and I always go for as mint condition as you can find.

“First I look at the condition of the face and hair and if the doll has any limbs bent or chewed or missing.

“If you can find any which are boxed then that’s really going to up their value.

“The clothes don’t really matter because they can be replaced.

“A face can even be repainted or repaired but they lose their value.

“Through my work as an artist I have become expert at doll restoration.

“I’ve helped other collectors restore their dolls which were not in the best condition.”

Unsurprisingly, Dawn was one of the first fans to buy a ticket to watch the movie starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken.

She said: “I really enjoyed the film but my favorite character was Ken. He was really funny and the whole movie was great fun.

“Since watching the movie, I’ve got my eye on several more Barbies online which I’m hoping to buy to add to my collection.

“I’ve got no plans to sell them. They are just too precious to me.”

,"Barbie, Oppenheimer ‘leading the charge’ to big profits for Cineplex: CEO",Cineplex Inc.’s net income mushroomed to $176.5 million in its second quarter as The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theatres and the cinema chain began preparing for a Barbie boost.,"Cineplex Inc.’s net income mushroomed to $176.5 million in its second quarter as The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theatres and the cinema chain began preparing for a Barbie boost.

Cineplex Inc.’s net income mushroomed to $176.5 million in its second quarter as The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theatres and the cinema chain began preparing for a Barbie boost.

The Toronto-based theatre giant said Thursday that its net income for the period ended June 30 towered over the $1.3 million it earned in the same period a year earlier.

Ellis Jacob, Cineplex chief executive, attributed the lift to “the return of strong film product,” which came as the company and other theatre chains continued to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily closed cinemas and slowed the flow of new releases.

“Our business made tremendous strides during the quarter and that momentum continues,” he said on a Thursday call with analysts.

The biggest hit Cineplex had on offer in the second quarter was The Super Mario Bros. Movie which set a record for the biggest opening for an animated film ever. Music screenings from BTS member Suga, Machine Gun Kelly and Coldplay and Punjabi films Annhi Dea Mazaak Ae, Godday Godday Chaa and Jodi also delivered audiences.

The lineup pushed up Cineplex’s second quarter revenues by 21 per cent to $423.1 million compared with $349.9 million the year before.

However, box office revenues of $164.5 million remained at 79 per cent of 2019 levels, which reached $189.4 million.

More progress may be made in the third quarter, which covers the July 21 releases of Barbie, the film starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling about the popular Mattel doll, and Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s epic about the creation of the atomic bomb.

The dual releases dubbed “Barbenheimer” were a “cultural phenomenon,” Jacob said, with patrons dressing up and arriving early to take photos in a booth resembling a Barbie box.

“The buzz around these films created an unprecedented box office and cultural event that transcended any streaming service experience by leaps and bounds,” he said.

Along with Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, Barbie and Oppenheimer brought Cineplex its highest July box office and its second-highest month on record, trailing December 2015, when Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens was released.

Some 6.8 million moviegoers visited Cineplex just last month compared with 12.8 million in the second quarter, up from almost 11.1 million a year ago.

They helped the company notch theatre food service revenues of $118.0 million, an increase of $19.9 million or 20.3 per cent compared with the prior year, primarily due to a 15.5 per cent increase in theatre attendance.

On an adjusted basis, Cineplex said its diluted earnings for the quarter hit $1.99 per share versus two cents per share a year prior, beating analyst expectations of 21 cents per share, according to financial markets firm Refinitiv.

The results included expenses related to the failed sale of Cineplex to Cineworld Group PLC transaction. Cineworld walked away from a $2.18-billion deal to buy Cineplex in 2020, sparking a court battle over whether Cineworld had the right to exit the agreement.

An Ontario court ruled in Cineplex’s favour in December 2021, awarding the company $1.24 billion in damages, but Cineworld said it would appeal the judgment, while Cineplex wanted to push for an even higher payout.

Cineworld has since filed a proposed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and Cineplex has said it does not expect to recover any material amount from its erstwhile suitor.

“We are just as disappointed with the outcome as our shareholders, but I want you to know that we will work tirelessly to explore all options to optimize the value of the litigation judgment,” Jacob said.

“We will now put this chapter behind us.”

Cineplex has also been grappling with a pair of strikes from the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Writers Guild of America, which have halted film and television productions along with promotional work for completed movies.

The cast of Oppenheimer walked out of their premiere in solidarity with striking workers, while Disney sent Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Maleficent and Cruella de Vil down the Haunted Mansion red carpet in lieu of stars Tiffany Haddish, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson.

Challengers, the Zendaya-starring tennis film due to open the Venice Film Festival, has since had its release date pushed back because of the strikes.

Cineplex is monitoring the job action “closely” and working with studio partners to minimize disruptions caused by the strikes, Jacob said.

“I hope it’s a short-term situation, but I can’t really guarantee anything,” he said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5bHZhbmxha2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1sZWFkaW5nLXRoZS1jaGFyZ2UtdG8tYmlnLXByb2ZpdHMtZm9yLWNpbmVwbGV4LWNlby02NTk4NTgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 15:30:00.745000+00:00,Einstein and Oppenheimer’s Real Relationship Was Cordial and Complicated,"Though Einstein didn’t help build the nuclear bomb and has just a few scenes in ‘Oppenheimer,’ they pack a punch—and reflect the two physicists’ real-life dynamic.","There’s a gutting scene midway through Oppenheimer that finds Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer at one of his lowest moments. Despite the scientist’s service to his country, he’s being accused of harboring treasonous sympathies; an unofficial trial with a foregone conclusion is dragging him through the mud. Outside his home in Princeton, he encounters a colleague: Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), who doesn’t seem to get why his fellow physicist is lying down and taking it.

If this is the reward the American government gives Oppenheimer after the years he spent developing the nuclear bomb that ended World War II, Einstein tells him in the film, Oppenheimer should simply “turn his back” on America. (It’s what Einstein was forced to do to his homeland of Germany, after all—and for understandable reasons, he would never trust governments or politicians.) What the essentially stateless Einstein doesn’t understand is that for New York City–born Oppenheimer, this simply isn’t an option. “Damnit,” he replies, “I happen to love this country.”

Like many of the details in Christopher Nolan’s script, both lines of dialogue come straight from Oppenheimer’s source material, Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s biography American Prometheus. (Though Oppenheimer’s memorable reply is actually lifted from a different exchange.) The scene is a neat illustration of how these two scientific giants both mirrored and opposed one another. Einstein only has a handful of scenes in Oppenheimer, but each of them packs a similar punch—particularly another (fictionalized) meeting that the film keeps coming back to, revealing its full significance only in the movie’s final moments.

It shouldn’t be surprising to learn that the man whose name has become synonymous with “genius” is only a supporting character in Nolan’s film. Though it was Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt that convinced FDR to begin a nuclear weapons program, Einstein was not involved in the Manhattan Project. (The government deemed him a security risk due to his left-leaning politics—though it cleared Oppenheimer, despite his various ties to Communists and Communist sympathizers.)

And though he and Oppenheimer both lived and worked in Princeton, New Jersey after the war—specifically at the Institute for Advanced Study, where Oppenheimer served as director from 1947 to 1966—they were not particularly close friends. (Though they’re in the same town, the Institute is not affiliated with Princeton University.) While they had known each other for years before he came to the Institute and he respected Einstein—who wouldn’t?—Oppenheimer thought of his predecessor “as a living patron saint of physics, not a working scientist,” Bird and Sherwin write. “In the last years of Einstein’s life, the last twenty-five years, his tradition in a certain sense failed him,” Oppenheimer would write in 1965, in a lecture later published in the New York Review of Books.

The older physicist was skeptical of quantum theory, which Oppenheimer would advance, and didn’t believe black holes could possibly exist. As shown in Oppenheimer, the younger physicist helped to prove they do. (In a paper published the same day Hitler invaded Poland!) Though Oppenheimer thought he was essentially old-fashioned, “Einstein eventually acquired a grudging respect for the new director” of the Institute, write Bird and Sherwin, “whom he described as ‘an unusually capable man of many-sided education.’ But what he admired about Oppenheimer was the man, not his physics.”

That said, the biographers indicate Einstein and Oppenheimer did still enjoy each others’ company. They relay a charming anecdote about the two that didn’t make it into Oppenheimer but would’ve been a gas to see. In 1948, they write, “knowing Einstein’s love of classical music, and knowing that his radio could not receive New York broadcasts of concerts from Carnegie Hall, Oppenheimer arranged to have an antenna installed on the roof of Einstein’s modest home at 112 Mercer Street. This was done without Einstein’s knowledge—and then on his birthday, Robert showed up on his doorstep with a new radio and suggested that they listen to a scheduled concert. Einstein was delighted.”

Years later, when Oppenheimer was targeted for his past Communist ties and stripped of his security clearance, Einstein was firmly on his colleague’s side—even if he didn’t understand Oppenheimer’s response. “The trouble with Oppenheimer is that he loves a woman who doesn't love him—the United States government,” he told a friend, per Bird and Sherwin. “The problem was simple: All Oppenheimer needed to do was to go to Washington, tell the officials that they were fools, and go home.” Einstein was (ahem) smart enough to keep those views private. Publicly, he expressed his support in a more palatable manner: “I admire him not only as a scientist but also as a great human being,” he told the press.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDIzLzA3L29wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWVpbnN0ZWluLW1vdmllLXJlYWwtbGlmZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:23:02+00:00,‘Barbie’ Nabs Huge $22.3 Million at Thursday Box Office,"Greta Gerwig's buzzy and acclaimed comedy, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is set to soar past a $100 million opening weekend","WrapPRO is free this week. See the inside scoops, expert analysis and exclusive data subscribers get daily. Click here for more information.
“Barbie” began its box office sprint on Thursday with a massive $22.3 million in preview grosses. That’s well above the $17-$21 million preshow grosses posted by “The Batman,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and “Avatar: The Way of Water.”
The Warner Bros. Discovery release, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and directed by Greta Gerwig, posted the biggest Thursday preview figure since “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” nabbed $28 million on its way to a $181 million domestic debut.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2JhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS10aHVyc2RheS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:19:02+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Makes $22.3 Million in Previews, ‘Oppenheimer’ Has $10.5 Million",'Barbie' makes $22.3 million in previews at the box office and 'Oppenheimer' makes $10.5 million,"“Barbenheimer” is finally here.
The biggest box office battle in years has begun, with Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” making $22.3 million at the domestic box office in Thursday previews. Universal’s “Oppenheimer” made $10.5 million in previews.
The “Barbie” preview haul is the biggest of the summer box office, beating the previous best of $17.5 million from “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.”
The summer movie showdown won’t be a close race, however, as Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie’s “Barbie” is expected to have a huge debut of well over $100 million in its opening weekend — with some estimates as high as $140 million, thanks to its massive marketing efforts. The large preview gross suggests the opening weekend may be closer to the high end of projections.
Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy’s “Oppenheimer” is estimated to open with $50 million, still a worthy second place. It beat the preview gross for “Dunkirk” ($5.5 million), Nolan’s last movie to open pre-pandemic. “Oppenheimer” also beat preview hauls from hits earlier this year like “John Wick 4” ($8.9 million), “Fast X” ($7.7 million) and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” ($7.2 million).
Both films stand to spin a nice profit during their runs; “Barbie” had a budget of $145 million and “Oppenheimer” cost $100 million. The real winners are, of course, theater owners and the approximately 200,000 “Barbenheimer” fans who booked same-day, double screenings of the films across the country.
Both movies are about globally recognizable figures (one, the physicist who created the atomic bomb, and the other, the most popular toy doll ever) and boast large, star-studded casts. In “Barbie,” Robbie brings the doll to life and travels from Barbie-Land to Earth with Ryan Gosling as her Ken. The cast also includes Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Helen Mirren, Will Ferrell and many more.
“Oppenheimer,” on the other hand, traces the life and career of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, across several decades. Nolan recruited his frequent collaborator Murphy as the distinctive historical figure, and the cast features Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and many, many more.
Last weekend’s box office champion, Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” will have to settle for third place. It’s expected to gain $28 million to $30 million in its second weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcHJldmlld3MtMTIzNTY3NTMwMy_SAV9odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXByZXZpZXdzLTEyMzU2NzUzMDMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Barbenheimer is Blowing Up — TVREV,"How the films are dominating theatrical movie TV advertising in July, plus 
a look at the resurgence of iconic Barbie songs.","Digging in a bit deeper, Universal Pictures has put an estimated $24.7 million in media value promoting Oppenheimer on national TV since the trailer first aired, resulting in 1.9 billion household TV ad impressions.
By comparison, Warner Bros. put a total of $8.7 million in national TV ad media value advertising Barbie, generating 1.2 billion household TV ad impressions — but that’s just for the trailer, and doesn’t take into account the myriad cross-promotions going on.
Chevrolet, Progressive and Candy Crush are three brands that have run TV ads with some sort of Barbie movie tie-in. Chevrolet’s ad for the ’24 Blazer EV even features quick cameos by cast members including Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera.
When you add in the above cross-promotion impressions and estimated TV ad media value, Barbie lands at 3.3 million TV ad impressions with $20.4 million in estimated media value.
Barbie’s premiere has also sparked a resurgence in streams of related iconic songs. According to Songtradr, Nicki Minaj’s “Barbie World” (with Ice Spice & Aqua) has seen Spotify streams soar over the last month, from 12.2 million to 65.2 million.
The original “Barbie Girl” Aqua song has also benefited from the popularity of the movie and marketing around it. Despite originally coming out in 1996, the song has been streamed well over 10 million times on Spotify since the beginning of July already. It’s also been featured in nearly 60K TikTok videos over the last week alone.
Barbie trailers are also driving shopping behaviors, as data from Tubular Labs points out.
Pulling from Tubular’s consumer insights, we can see how Warner Bros. Pictures social video audiences increased their shopping affinity for Barbie products on Amazon following the release of the Barbie movie trailer. Affinity increased from 1.8x more likely than the norm in March 2023, to 4.8x more likely in April, and it’s remained at a similarly increased affinity in the months since.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2cmV2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1pcy1ibG93aW5nLXVwbmJzcNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2cmV2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJlbmhlaW1lci1pcy1ibG93aW5nLXVwbmJzcD9mb3JtYXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-12 18:47:26+00:00,‘Barbie’ Cleared for Release in Philippines After Review of Controversial Map’s Inclusion,"After a review of ""Barbie"" and its inclusion of a controversial South China Sea map, the Philippines has concluded it simply depicts Barbie Land.","After an extensive review of “Barbie” and the film’s inclusion of a controversial South China Sea map, the government of the Philippines has concluded that the cartoonish drawing simply depicts a “make-believe journey” of Barbie Land.
Therefore, the movie now has clearance to be shown in Philippine theaters, government officials said Wednesday.
The government said it conducted two review sessions, thorough deliberations and consultations with relevant government agencies, including a legal expert on the West Philippine Sea to reach its conclusion.
“Considering the context by which the cartoonish map of the character ‘Weird Barbie’ was portrayed in the film, the review committee is convinced that the contentious scene does not depict the ‘nine-dash line,’” the government’s Movie and Television Review and Classification Board said in a statement Wednesday.
Instead, the board said, the map portrayed the route of the make-believe journey of Barbie from Barbie Land to the “real world,” as an integral part of the story.
“Rest assured that the Board has exhausted all possible resources in arriving at this decision as we have not hesitated in the past to sanction filmmakers/ producers/distributors for exhibiting the fictitious ‘nine-dash line’ in their materials,” the board said.
However, the government officials issued a stern warning to “all filmmakers, producers, and distributors” that the country will not hesitate to sanction or ban films that exhibit the “nine-dash line,” which a disputed Chinese territorial claim.
Last week, Vietnam banned the movie, while a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz piled on criticism.
“China wants to control what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think,” a spokesperson for Cruz said, “and they leverage their massive film markets to coerce American companies into pushing Chinese Communist Party propaganda — just like the way the Barbie film seems to have done with the map.”
Warner Bros. said in a statement last week that the map was simply a “child-like crayon drawing” of Barbie Land.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2JhcmJpYmFyYmllLXBoaWxpcHBpbmVzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc291dGgtY2hpbmEtc2VhLW1hcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-12 11:01:55+00:00,Philippines allows Barbie film but wants ‘childlike’ map lines blurred,Country’s censors give green light for film to be shown amid South China Sea controversy,"Philippine censors have allowed the Barbie film to be shown in the country’s cinemas after asking its Hollywood distributor to blur lines on a brightly coloured drawing of a world map allegedly showing China’s claims to the disputed South China Sea.
The fantasy comedy film about the famous doll, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is to open in the south-east Asian nation on 19 July.
After reviewing the film twice and consulting foreign affairs officials and legal experts, the government’s movie and television review and classification board said it would allow it to be screened.
The censors began examining Barbie last week after Vietnam reportedly banned the film over scenes featuring a map showing the so-called nine-dash line, which China uses to justify its maritime claims.
Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, despite rival claims from other south-east Asian countries, including the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.
After “meticulous” scrutiny of the film, Philippine censors were convinced that the “cartoonish map” did not depict the nine-dash line.
“Instead, the map portrayed the route of the make-believe journey of Barbie from Barbie Land to the ’real world’, as an integral part of the story,” the censorship board said.
“Rest assured that the board has exhausted all possible resources in arriving at this decision as we have not hesitated in the past to sanction filmmakers/ producers/distributors for exhibiting the fictitious ’nine-dash line’ in their materials.”
In a separate letter to the Philippine senator Francis Tolentino, who had criticised the film for “violating Filipino fisherfolks’ rights”, the censors said they had asked the Hollywood studio Warner Bros to “blur” the controversial lines on the map.
Dashed lines drawn in a “childlike manner” appeared in several locations on the map around land masses identified as Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia, the censors said.
But it found only eight dashes around the landmass labelled “Asia”.
“Moreover, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia are not visible on the map,” the board said in the letter dated 11 July and shared with reporters. “This is in stark contrast to the maps found in the banned films Abominable (2019) and Uncharted (2022),” it said.
The Philippine department of foreign affairs said it appreciated the opportunity to watch Barbie to “ascertain if the depiction of the imaginary world map is inimical to the national interest”.
Warner Bros did not immediately respond to request for comment but a spokesperson was quoted by Variety as saying the map was a “childlike crayon drawing” and “not intended to make any type of statement”.
The Philippines’ approval of Barbie coincided with the seventh anniversary of an international ruling that China’s historical claims to the South China Sea have no legal basis.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL2p1bC8xMi9waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1hbGxvd3MtYmFyYmllLWZpbG0tYnV0LXdhbnRzLWNoaWxkbGlrZS1tYXAtbGluZXMtYmx1cnJlZNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL2p1bC8xMi9waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1hbGxvd3MtYmFyYmllLWZpbG0tYnV0LXdhbnRzLWNoaWxkbGlrZS1tYXAtbGluZXMtYmx1cnJlZA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

With the “Barbie” movie release date fast approaching, the latest teaser features Ryan Gosling’s Ken bemoaning life in his female companion’s shadow.
“I just don’t know who I am without you,” Ken tells Margot Robbie’s Barbie in the trailer, released Monday.
Just Ken Exclusive
We then see Ken singing about the dynamic between the pair, who are best friends.
“It doesn’t seem to matter what I do, I’m always number two,” he croons. “No one knows how hard I try.”
Ken then reveals his unrequited feelings for Barbie.
“I’m just Ken. Where I see love she sees a friend,” he sings. “What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan, and fight for me?”
The teaser is part of promotional efforts for the new “Barbie” movie from Warner Bros., which is set for release on July 21. Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.
The live-action movie is directed by Greta Gerwig and sees Barbie and Ken leave Barbie Land to explore the “real world.”

It also gives the first taste of Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?”
“We made this song for Barbie and it means the absolute worrrrllld to me,” Eilish wrote on Instagram, announcing that the song will be part of the film’s soundtrack last week. “This movie is gonna change ur lives, and hopefully this song will too. Get ready to sob.”
She wasn’t kidding about the tears; the wistful, piano-led ballad soundtracks the new emotional clip, lending weight to what appears on the surface to be a happy, very pink world.

“Close your eyes, take my hands, close your eyes, now feel,” Barbie is told. When she opens her eyes, she’s transported into a magical pink place with a smile on her face, as she descends from her shiny house into a pink convertible. Later, she’s on a beach at night being serenaded by Ken (Ryan Gosling) by a bonfire as the lilting piano melody buoys the romance.
But all is not happy and romantic in Barbieland, as the teaser shows the emotional turmoil rocking Barbie’s world, and the upset-looking doll running through the Mattel offices while she is chased by folks in suits.

“It felt like we had to give the counterargument to Barbie, and not give it short shrift, but give it real intellectual and emotional power,” Gerwig said. “And Mattel was incredibly open to it.

This ultimate mashup blends the story of Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy in the Christopher Nolan film but now portrayed by an AI generated version of Margot Robbie as Barbie, who embarks on nuclear research while donning a fashionable pink hat, embracing the iconic doll's aesthetic.
Joining Barbie in the ""Barbenheimer"" universe are other beloved characters, each uniquely adapted to the whimsical blend of genres. Matt Damon's character finds himself donning a pink military uniform, blending strength with elegance, while the government official, played by the dashing Robert Downey Jr., radiates impeccable fashion sense. It also features a bizarre version of Ryan Gosling as Ken that looks like another A-list actor.
Barbenheimer' and the impact of Artificial Intelligence in filmmaking
As anticipation builds for the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer, industry experts predict an unprecedented box office success for both films.
The emergence of ""Barbenheimer"" serves as a testament to the boundless creativity and potential of artificial intelligence. It showcases how AI can not only enrich our lives through innovative solutions but also revolutionize the entertainment industry by fostering unimagined fusions of ideas and concepts. Or at least make a really good meme.
As the release date approaches, fans eagerly await the chance to witness this captivating crossover on the big screen. Prepare to be enchanted by the enchanting world of ""Barbenheimer,"" where the worlds of Oppenheimer and Barbie intertwine in an extraordinary cinematic feat.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9saWZlc3R5bGUvbW92aWVzLzIwMjMvMDcvMjAvNjRiOGM2YWZlMjcwNGUwMjY3OGI0NWEwLmh0bWzSAVJodHRwczovL2FtcC5tYXJjYS5jb20vZW4vbGlmZXN0eWxlL21vdmllcy8yMDIzLzA3LzIwLzY0YjhjNmFmZTI3MDRlMDI2NzhiNDVhMC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 10:00:00+00:00,New “Barbie” Album Trailer Unveils Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice’s “Barbie World” Track & Many More,"The new ""Barbie"" album trailer has nearly as many music superstars as the film has acting stars.","New “Barbie” Album Trailer Unveils Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice’s “Barbie World” Track & Many More
Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice’s “Barbie World,” Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive,” Sam Smith’s “Man I Am,” Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?,” and Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night” are just some of the tracks on the Barbie album, a fittingly superstar-studded musical collaboration for Greta Gerwig’s superstar-packed film. Those are the artists featured in this brand-new Barbie trailer, which gives us a few new looks at Gerwig’s take on the iconic Matell doll, which is in theaters now after many months of growing excitement, amplified by the insanely clever marketing team.
Barbie stars Margot Robbie as the titular iconic doll, only in Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach’s story, Barbie’s perfect life in Barbie Land is about to come undone. While life there, amongst a bevy of other Barbies, each with a different job (played by Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, Hari Nef, Emma Mackey, and more), and Kens (Ryan Gosling, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans, and more) is as smooth as plastic and trouble-free, an existential crisis leads Robbie and Gosling’s Barbie and Ken to venture out of Barbie Land and into the real world, a decidedly imperfect, downright terrifying place, in order to save their home.
By now, you likely know that all eyes have been on July 21 for months, as excitement over Gerwig’s spin on Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer reached such a fevered pitch it birthed a new term, “Barbenheimer,” coined to describe the film fans who are planning on seeing both movies in the theaters this weekend. The differences between these two potential blockbusters only make them more intensely appealing as a double bill. It’s safe to say, however, that you won’t find Lizzo or Tame Impala on the Oppenheimer album.
The Barbie album also includes Fifty Fity, The Kid Laroi, Pinnk Panthress, HAIM, Khalid, Karol G, and more. You can check out more about the album here.

2023-07-24 20:17:00+00:00,'Barbie': Everything to Know About the Sets and Filming Locations,"Here's every can't-miss detail from the Barbie movie sets and filming locations, including the Barbie dream house inspiration and Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House.","Barbie has been top of mind ever since the film’s first look images of Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken were released more than a year ago. The Greta Gerwig-directed movie sparked the vibrant Barbiecore trend and birthed seemingly endless collabs with brands like and . Now that we've just surpassed the movie's July 21 theatrical release, the Barbie buzz is hitting its peak. Whether you've seen the movie twice already or are still waiting to catch your first screening, we've laid out all of the can't-miss set and filming location details from this summer's most talked about production.
The real-world scenes were filmed in Los Angeles.

By now, you know that Barbie leaves her picture-perfect world for the real world. Her exit from the pink paradise lands her in Los Angeles. In the first look photos , Robbie and Gosling were seen roller skating down the boardwalk in Venice Beach. Will Ferrell was also spotted at the location wearing skates.
Barbie Land is literally shaped like its name.

If you thought the Barbie Land lettering in the film was just a cute design introductory to the fantasy world, you didn't look close enough. ""When you go into Barbie Land, you go into the dot of the 'i' of Barbie Land,"" production designer Sarah Greenwood tells House Beautiful. ""So the streets are written as Barbie Land, and the 'i' is the circle that they live in.""
Barbie Land is layered with 3-D and 2-D elements.
Greenwood compares the Barbie sets to dioramas and museum exhibits because they feature layers of 3-D and 2-D elements. Across Barbie Land, the 50-foot-tall painted sky stretched 800 feet around the studio with 35-foot-tall mountain cutouts set against them. As you get closer to the center of the sets, items become 3-D. Barbie's dream house includes a blend of 3-D and 2-D features as the actual toys do. Take her fridge, for example, which includes a decal of food and beverages for the interior and ""toy"" versions of them in the door shelving that Barbie can actually pick up.
Painted backgrounds add to Barbie Land’s artificial feel.

In a Vogue interview, Gerwig revealed that the movie's design is guided by old soundstage Technicolor musicals that ""have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality."" She explained: ""You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it’s also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to.""
Painted backdrops are also used for the sequences when characters in the movie travel from Barbie Land to the real world and vice versa. If you're into the slightly surreal look, a mural wallpaper might offer a similar effect in your own home—whether you’re after a Barbie-themed design or a natural landscape.
The Barbie dream houses were inspired by Palm Springs.
Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
Built at the iconic Warner Bros. Studios lot outside of London , the Barbie dream houses were inspired by the midcentury modern architecture and cul-de-sacs in Palm Springs . Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer specifically looked to Richard Neutra’s 1946 Kaufmann House, which happens to be one of the filming locations featured in Don’t Worry Darling . They landed on this design route early on in the process since they knew they weren't looking to replicate an existing Mattel Barbie dream house. The midcentury modern architecture lent itself nicely to the basic elements of the toy houses that the team focused on, like an open flow between rooms with no walls. Logistically, it was also important for the production to easily shoot from one house to another. Placing the houses in a circle allowed for this and ensured Barbie could see all of her friends.
""It's very interesting because everybody says, Oh my God, it's just like a dream house I used to have,"" Greenwood says. ""And you go, Well, maybe that's what it feels like, which is good, but it's not a dream house. It's the feeling of a dream house.""
Stereotypical Barbie's dream house has so many details viewers won't want to miss.
Look out for pink monkey statues, the flamingo mailbox, the wardrobe with glass doors (meant to mimic the urge to rip through a plastic Barbie box), and the kidney-shaped pool with a spiral slide (Robbie’s favorite feature).
The sets are smaller than human size.

The dream houses were adjusted to 23 percent smaller than human size. ""The ceiling is actually quite close to one's head, and it only takes a few paces to cross the room,"" Gerwig told Architectural Digest. ""It has the odd effect of making the actors seem big in the space but small overall.""
Even though the homes were scaled down, they were still large structures. ""When people were on the top bedroom floor, they had to be wired off,"" Spencer tells House Beautiful. ""It was high. It was real. There's no fakery there.""
Constructing the dream houses was an enormous engineering challenge.
While the dream houses look simple, that’s the very reason they were challenging to construct. Without walls, the homes are mainly floors, poles, and beams. (""The world outside had to become the wallpaper,"" Greenwood notes.) Each home has a chimney that visually grounds it, but the overall architecture is a bit skeleton-like and was challenging to make sturdy.
A dance number calls for a sparkly makeover.
Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
At the beginning of the film, the dream houses get a sparkly makeover for a dance number. A reflective streamer backdrop sets the tone. The rooms of the open dream houses were covered in what looks like little square mirrors in gold and shades of pink. Of course, plenty of lights add to the shine and high energy.
Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House included 22 TV screens.
Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
When Ken turns Barbie’s dream house into his ""Mojo Dojo Casa House,"" the redesign is everything you'd expect of a hideous man cave . ""I love the fact that if he was in one of his leather chairs, he would have his mini fridges stacked up around him like he's in Game of Thrones,"" Spencer says.
Other details that contributed to the contrasting aesthetic were the swinging saloon doors, a blender filled with Cheetos, 22 TV screens all playing the same horse-themed footage, and tons of black leather sofas (which necessitated a lengthy sourcing hunt for the production team to track down!).
Weird Barbie's house is designed to look squashed.
Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
Weird Barbie (played by Kate Mckinnon)—whose look might remind you of the Cynthia doll in Rugrats—lives in a secluded residence. Influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho, the hilltop structure has a winding stair-clad path and is marked by a colorful, funky gated entrance. It's designed to look squashed since the architecture doesn't feature a single right angle. While it lacks some essentials, like a kitchen, Weird Barbie's home is a desirable piece of toy real estate—here's why, with deeper insight from Greenwood and Spencer (including where they got the fun living room rug and bubble chandeliers!).
The Mattel office was designed to feel like it's in two worlds.

The Mattel office is meant to be halfway between the real world and Barbie Land. Gerwig described the boardroom as ""a six-year-old girl's pink and fluffy heart"" in the movie's script. The playful atmosphere emphasizes the childlike qualities of the executives who fill it. If you're eager to analyze it further, get more insight into the vibrant set design and its contrasting black-and-white cubicle set here.

The treehouse was replicated from the toy.
In Barbie's cul-de-sac, there's a 1985 treehouse marked by a sign that reads ""This property has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places"" by ""Barbie Department of the Interior."" Nearby, there's a toy version of the treehouse with the name ""Chelsea"" next to it. This treehouse was replicated from the toy, which was the doll Chelsea's treehouse. The dolls Skipper and Midge live in the treehouse.
The movie used up one company's global supply of fluorescent pink paint.
Naturally, the sets required a lot of pink paint. The seemingly white shade on set is, in fact, a very light pink. But for the fluorescent pink shade, the production used Rosco's entire supply . The company told The Los Angeles Times that its supply during the film's 2022 production was already lower than usual thanks to a stunted supply chain from the COVID-19 pandemic and a 2021 Texas deep freeze that damaged materials used to make the paint. ""They used as much paint as we had,"" Lauren Proud, the vice president of global marketing for Rosco, told the outlet.
There's even a pink sand beach.

The pink doesn't stop at paint, clothing, and accessories. It even extends to the ""natural"" environment in Barbie Land—including the beaches that are made up of pink sand.

2023-08-04 14:45:30+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Meg 2’ Bites Into $3.2 Million in Previews, ‘Barbie’ Crosses $400 Million Domestically","'Meg 2' earned $3.2 Million in previews, while 'Barbie' crossed the $400 million mark at the domestic box office.","“Meg 2: The Trench” sunk its pearly whites into $3.2 million in Thursday previews, as the followup to the 2018 Jason Statham hit is hoping to premiere to $30 million.
Critics have feasted on the film, giving it a dreadful 28% “rotten” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the pulverizing reviews may not have much impact on audiences who don’t turn up to these type of movies out of a desire to see a pioneering work of cinema. Instead, they’ll get a chance to witness a 75-foot-long megalodon, and other sea creatures who prefer human flesh to plankton, make short work of a group of scientists. Warner Bros. is backing the movie, which cost $129 million to produce.
“Meg 2” will do battle with Paramount and Nickelodeon’s animated adventure “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which opened on Wednesday. The PG-rated family film has already generated $15.1 million, and is looking for a five-day opening of $35 million to $45 million. It earned $4.9 million on Thursday. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” has a budget of $70 million, an economical figure given that most animated movies cost north of $100 million.
But probably neither movie will be able to dethrone “Barbie,” which continues to dominate the box office. The Warner Bros. release is the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $406 million in North America after picking up $11.8 million on Thursday.
Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is also on the precipice of a box office milestone. The R-rated drama about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his work on the atomic bomb has earned $199.9 million domestically. It should cross the $200 million mark at any moment after earning $5.6 million on Thursday. That’s a remarkable result for Universal, which backed the $100 million drama, and a sign that even a serious movie about a weighty subject can thrive at the summer box office, even when it faces competition from a very big shark.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1tZWctMi1wcmV2aWV3cy1iYXJiaWUtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1Njg3OTM5L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYm94LW9mZmljZS1tZWctMi1wcmV2aWV3cy1iYXJiaWUtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1Njg3OTM5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-30 14:00:00+00:00,The Barbie Ending Explained: Why Does Barbie Go to the Gynecologist?,"""I knew I wanted to end on a mic drop kind of joke, but I also find it very emotional,"" Greta Gerwig explains.","Spoilers ahead!
The ending of Barbie isn't exactly what viewers would expect. When Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) decides to leave Barbieland and become a real human, it appears Gloria (America Ferrera) and her family are dropping her off for a job interview. Instead, she walks inside to a nondescript building, wearing perfect pink Birkenstocks, and declares, ""I'm here to see my gynecologist.""
The simple line carried a much deeper meaning. ""With this film, it was important for me that everything operated on at least two levels,"" writer and director Greta Gerwig about that final moment. ""I knew I wanted to end on a mic drop kind of joke, but I also find it very emotional. When I was a teenage girl, I remember growing up and being embarrassed about my body, and just feeling ashamed in a way that I couldn’t even describe. It felt like everything had to be hidden.""
She continues, ""And then to see Margot as Barbie, with this big old smile on her face, saying what she says at the end with such happiness and joy. I was like, if I can give girls that feeling of, 'Barbie does it, too'–that’s both funny and emotional. There are so many things like that throughout the movie. It was always about looking for the levity and the heart."" There's a personal tie for Gerwig, too: growing up, her mom Christine Sauer worked as an OB-GYN nurse.
In a separate interview with the New York Times, Gerwig said it was Robbie's line delivery that sealed the deal. ""I wasn't really certain until I was in rehearsals and reading it with Margot. I had a feeling of what I wanted it to be, but then she did it, and there was something so incredibly winning and hilarious and empathetic about the way she said that last line. I was like, 'That's it!' It’s so utterly sincere and silly at the same time.""
She also said it came to her in a dream. Gerwig told IndieWire, ""I feel that line and that ending is something that I feel about most things that I’ve ever made — there’s something where I don't rightly feel like I can take credit for it. It sort of came to me in a dream and then it was like, 'It can be no other way.'""

,The ‘Barbie’ Movie Just Dropped Another Trailer and You’ve Gotta See It,"Here's what you need to know about the live-action 'Barbie' movie, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken. See 'Barbie' pictures here.","Something cataclysmic happened when the world ~officially~ learned that a Barbie movie got the green light from Hollywood. And that something is a constant stream of sneak-peek content we didn’t know we needed. Immediately after filming began back in March 2022, dozens of photos of the movie’s leads—Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, of course—dropped and have continued to come out, and I personally have not known peace. Ryan even wore a shirt emblazoned with the face of fellow Barbie costar Ncuti Gatwa in his role as Doctor Who, which, okay, iconic!
Thanks to Mattel and Warner Bros., a slew of legendary characters are being brought to live-action life for the first time ever. And with Margot as Barbie’s lead protagonist and producer, to say we’re excited is an understatement. The actor has previously spoken with Variety about the film and said, “I think it’s a great opportunity to put some positivity out in the world and a chance to be aspirational for younger kids.” Obsessed!
If you’re also screaming/crying/throwing up at the thought of watching the Barbie movie IRL, here is everything we know so far to tide you over.
First of all, we have *multiple* trailers!
WATCH THE FIRST ONE IMMEDIATELY:
And here’s another one that came out earlier today:
New stills from #Barbie, coming to theaters July 21. pic.twitter.com/FpVfSrS6y5 — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) May 25, 2023
So, who is starring in Barbie?
Some serious A-list talent, if you ask me. Case in point? Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are playing Barbie and Ken. Plus, Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings’ Simu Liu are both confirmed as two other Ken dolls in the movie. Insecure’s Issa Rae is also set to play another Barbie alongside Transparent’s Hari Nef. Will Ferrell, for his part, is currently cast as the CEO of a toy company. Plus, Kate McKinnon, Emma Mackey (who, btw, could be Margot’s twin), America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Alexandra Shipp, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Rhea Perlman, Emerald Fennell, Sharon Rooney, Ariana Greenblatt, and Jamie Demetriou will be making appearances. Oh, and DUA LIPA IS IN THE MOVIE TOO!!!
Yep, back in April, 24 new character posters from Barbie were released, and the British singer was hard to miss with her striking blue hair. And from the looks of it, it seems as though she’s been cast as a mermaid doll, which is truly such a *chef’s kiss* choice. The A-lister even took to Instagram to post the exciting news:
TL;DR: You’ll likely have to rewatch the film to catch all the epic cameos.
What is Barbie going to be about?
Okay, so this one is less clear. Given the fact that the script has gone through several rewrites and creative changes since the film started production in 2014 (yep, you read that right), we can pretty much guarantee the vibe has shifted over time. How-ev-er! It’s currently under the leadership of actor/producer extraordinaire Greta Gerwig and her partner, filmmaker Noah Baumbach. So if there’s one thing we can guarantee, it’s that the final version won’t be a cookie-cutter movie in the slightest.
In December 2020, Margot gave us a hint about the project’s inner workings when she spoke with the Hollywood Reporter. “We like the things that feel a little left of center. Something like Barbie where the IP, the name itself, people immediately have an idea of, ‘Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is,’ but our goal is to be like, ‘Whatever you’re thinking, we’re going to give you something totally different—the thing you didn’t know you wanted.’ Now, can we truly honor the IP and the fan base and also surprise people? Because if we can do all that and provoke a thoughtful conversation, then we’re really firing on all cylinders,” she said. Greta also told the publication in a separate interview that “Warner Bros. is open to strange.” Color me intrigued!
When does the Barbie movie come out? What’s the Barbie release date?
Again, the story of this movie is truly a doozy. Early discussions took place as early as 2009, before it started undergoing production in 2014 via Sony Pictures. Then it was passed between a number of writers and directors—at one point, writer and producer Diablo Cody, who penned Juno, was charged with the screenplay—before finally being transferred to Warner Bros. This means that the film has had, well, its fair share of release dates set, including two in 2018 and even a COVID-19-related one in 2020.
But now, it’s confirmed that Barbie’s official release date is July 21, 2023. Mark your calendars!
Will Barbie be available to stream?
There has been no actual announcement yet about whether Barbie will be available to stream. But since it is a Warner Bros. film, we might not be far off in saying that it will likely appear on HBO Max’s platform 45 days after its cinematic release, since the company pledged to give exclusive access to theaters for that amount of time. If the studio follows its currently established pattern, fans might be able to watch Barbie online as early as September 2023!

,'Barbie' Cast on Representation and the 'Coolest Thing About Being a Barbie' (Exclusive Clip),"In a behind-the-scenes look at 'Barbie,' director Greta Gerwig and stars Margot Robbie, Issa Rae and more discuss how the movie allows everyone to see themselves as a Barbie in Barbie Land","Greta Gerwig felt compelled to make representation an important aspect of the Barbie movie.
In a behind-the-scenes clip shared exclusively with PEOPLE, Gerwig, 39, the film's star Margot Robbie and a number of other actors who portray Barbies in the film speak to the movie's emphasis on how everyone — and anyone — can be Barbie.
“In Barbie Land, we all are Barbie. It’s fun and friendship, female 24/7,"" Robbie, 33, says in the clip.
“Something that was really important to me is that making sure everyone could see themselves as Barbie or see themselves as a Ken,"" adds Gerwig, who cowrote the movie with her partner Noah Baumbach.
A number of actors — including Hari Nef, Emma Mackey, Dua Lipa, Ana Cruz Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Kate McKinnon, Nicola Coughlan, Alexandra Shipp, Ritu Arya and Issa Rae — play different Barbies in the movie. Ryan Gosling stars as Ken, though Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Kingsley Ben-Adir and Scott Evans also portray different Kens in Barbie Land.

“We are all Barbie, and we are all everything,"" Nef says in the featurette.
“Not every Barbie is the same Barbie, and not every girl is the same girl,"" Shipp adds. ""And to see yourself really does change your perspective.”

“Beautiful feminine energy ruling the world,” Ana Cruz-Kayne says of Barbie Land in the clip, while Sharon Rooney says, ""That’s the coolest thing about being a Barbie.”
“It's just really fun,” Robbie adds. “I love it so much.”

Several Barbie trailers have teased Barbie's decision to leave Barbie Land and travel to the real world along with Ken. ""To live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you're a Ken,"" reads an official logline for the movie.
Gerwig recently told PEOPLE in the special Barbie issue (out now) that she hopes the movie ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.""
""There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,"" Gerwig said. ""I want to go back to Barbie Land.""

2023-07-24 16:01:00+00:00,Barbie Movie Ending Explained: The Film's Final Joke Is a Meaningful Lesson,Here's what happens at the end of the 'Barbie' movie—and why it means so much.,"Spoilers below.
Barbie is not a mother, unless you count the millions of young girls she’s shaped in her image—whom, of course, you must count. Barbie the movie, director Greta Gerwig’s record-breaking box-office hit, takes this contradiction seriously, in so far as any film combining corporate branding, cellulite, Matchbox Twenty, and death can take itself seriously. Barbie was never meant to be a mother; the pregnant doll Mattel invented as a proxy for Barbie was Happy Family Midge, whose removable-baby belly was condemned for “promoting” teen pregnancy. As narrator Helen Mirren informs audiences in the opening scenes of Barbie, Midge was discontinued for being “too weird,” apparently too difficult to reconcile with childhood imagination. Barbie herself has remained smooth and ageless and, importantly, without reproductive organs of any kind for the entirety of her 64 years on Mattel’s factory line. Which is exactly why the Barbie movie’s ending is so delightfully subversive.
Anyone, and certainly any woman—whether cis, trans, or otherwise—or non-binary person, will tell you that genitals mean a great deal to a great number of people, regardless of whether or not they should. Within hours of Margot Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie stepping into Barbie’s “Real World,” she enlightens a group of men heckling her with the simple truth that she has no genitals, and neither does Ken—so, hey, the joke’s on them. This fact does not seem to bother Barbie herself; it is Ken, rather, who appears humiliated by the revelation.
The film tickles these gendered defenses until they collapse, culminating in a confrontation in Barbie Land between the recently brainwashed Barbies and the newly educated Kens, who’ve decided to bring patriarchy back to Barbie Land in the form of beer and horses and the vocal inflections of Rob Thomas. But the fight does not end with Barbie restoring the Great Feminist Order to her world, where the Kens are free to beach each other off into oblivion; instead, she realizes just how flawed her understanding of gender was from the beginning.
Jaap Buitendijk
She meets, once again, with her creator, Ruth Handler (as portrayed by Rhea Perlman), who takes her betwixt the membranes of the Real World and Barbie Land. This dimension—wherever or whatever it might be—has no clear beginning or end. It is the hazy white room of the In Between. I’d go so far as to say it’s an allegorical in-utero, its inhabitants not yet born but undeniably real, floating in contested territory. Here, Ruth presents Barbie with a deeper version of the choice first posited by Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie at the beginning of the film: Stay and remain one-dimensional, or leave and embrace chaos. Ruth makes the perils of this choice obvious. If Barbie stays, she’ll forever mimic a version of perfection she no longer believes in. If she leaves, she will no longer be an idea but a creature, one that can live but can also die. Her arched footprint will no longer be ideological but material, and the consequences will be much harder to ignore.
“We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they’ve come,” Ruth tells Barbie, in one of the film’s more fascinating lines. She is referencing, of course, her relationship to her own daughter—Barbara Handler, whom Barbie was named after. But she is also referencing Barbie herself, whom Ruth imagined and designed and fought for and sold. By “looking back” at the found-footage sequence Ruth then presents, as if through a prophetic vision, Barbie can see how far she has come, both in the context of the film itself and in the greater cultural imagination over her six decades of iconography. Barbie means something different to a modern era than she did to the children of 1959. But she continues to influence them; she continues to raise them. It is a beautiful, complicated thing, just like the slices of life displayed in the home videos. And it poses a great responsibility, to which Barbie accepts the challenge. “Yes.”
Yet the film does not end here. The actual ending of Barbie takes place in one final sequence, as Barbie’s new human family (including America Ferrera’s Gloria and Ariana Greenblatt’s Sasha) drops her off at an unmarked office building. We don’t know exactly where Barbie is, only that she’s preparing for a momentous occasion in the Real World. Perhaps a job interview? Maybe the DMV? Gerwig gives us one last smirk as Barbie marches up to the front desk and announces, “I’m here to see my gynecologist.”
It’s a last laugh for the ages. But what makes it such a perfect line to end with is not only its humor but its significance. Barbie is a human now. She has, we can assume, human organs. The specific nature of those organs doesn’t matter. The mechanics of how she received these organs doesn’t matter either, no more than it mattered how Barbie could magically float from her rooftop to her pink Corvette any time a child picked her up to play. What matters is that she now carries the hallmarks of human womanhood, and she must learn how to live with them.
Now, I think it’s important to note here what Gerwig is not saying: that womanhood or motherhood are designated purely by the status of one’s reproductive organs. Rather, I believe she’s alluding to the opposite: that such statuses are complicated, such organs are complicated, and that they should be—because the complexity of humanity is a source of its beauty. At the end of the film, Stereotypical Barbie takes her first step to embracing that complexity by waltzing into a historic human institution of care and confusion, pleasure and pain: the gynecologist’s office.
As the daughter of a gynecologist, I have long associated my mother’s workplace with both the unsettling smell of antiseptic and the warmth of her laugh echoing from the examination room. I am not yet a mother, but I have one, and I have walked (and played) in the corridors where so many mothers are made—biological, adoptive, figurative, and otherwise. It should go without saying that Barbie does not need genitals to be a mother, nor does she need to give birth to have influence. But by giving Barbie organs, and by taking her to the place where such organs are cared for, Gerwig plants Barbie firmly in the complexity of our own human experiences. She is held up not just as an icon of our dreams (and insecurities), but as a mirror to our lived reality. There is enormous power in such an act, particularly for a corporate brand that has wielded such power over children’s aspirations.
As many critics have already pointed out, Barbie can’t fix Barbie. The film itself is flawed, compromised by its own subject matter and an explosive marketing campaign. There are parts of the movie I wish dug deeper, hit harder, and stayed longer. But I will remember that ending. I will remember the way it presented Barbie as a mother—not because she has organs, or children, or even a good gynecologist, but because she is so happy to be gloriously, undeniably human, and she wants to share that feeling with us. Going to the gynecologist is the best part of her day! She has raised so many around her; to see her thrilled to embrace the messy reality of womanhood gives us permission to do the same. Like Ruth, she seems to demand we turn around and assess how far we’ve come.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvbW92aWVzLXR2L2E0NDYxOTU2Ni9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtZW5kaW5nLWV4cGxhaW5lZC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-07 14:04:13+00:00,"‘Sharknado’ Channels ‘Barbie’ as B-Movie Hit Gets New Poster, Trailer Ahead of 10th Anniversary Theatrical Release (Exclusive)",See the Barbie-inspired Sharknado poster as the 2013 SyFy movie hits theaters for the first time.,"A decade after it became an unexpected smash on the SyFy Channel, spawning a low-budget B-movie franchise in the process, Sharknado — in which Tara Reid, Ian Ziering and John Heard battle a tornado that sucks up great whites and hammerheads and spits them out over Los Angeles — is about to hit cinemas for the very first time as part of a two-day 10th anniversary celebration.
And to help promote the return of its most famous creation, producers at The Asylum have, not unlike in their infamous slate of so-called mockbuster titles, turned to the current movie-of-the-moment for some inspiration. In an alternative special poster revealed exclusively by The Hollywood Reporter, Sharknado is given a Barbie twist, with Barbie seen driving her pink convertible into a pink hurricane flinging killer sharks (some pink) from the sky, and Ken wielding a chainsaw. It’s unlikely this came with any approval from Mattel.
The “fully remastered” version of Sharknado will release on Aug. 15 and 16 and reportedly features hundreds of new special effects, including “new kills” and “new thrills” according to the trailer. “More sharks, more ‘nado,” it proudly announces.
In a detailed oral history of Sharknado published in 2018, the creative team behind the film, including director Anthony C. Ferrante, explained how it began life as a throwaway line in another low-budget feature (about a murderous leprechaun) that somehow ended up in a pitch session during the American Film Market. Not expected to go anywhere, on July 13 the $1 million film suddenly became an overnight cultural phenomenon on the SyFy channel, leading to five sequels and a Las Vegas musical, cementing The Asylum’s name in B-movie infamy.

The movie is set to make its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on Sept. 2 and will release on Netflix Wednesday, Dec. 20","Bradley Cooper is unrecognizable in his latest role.
In Maestro, which he also directed, Cooper, 48, plays the late Leonard Bernstein, famed conductor and West Side Story composer.
The A Star Is Born actor-director stars alongside Carey Mulligan in the first trailer, as the She Said actress portrays Bernstein's wife Felicia Montealegre. The pair are shown sitting back-to-back in a field multiple times through their lifetimes as the trailer teases moments from Bernstein's legendary composing career and the couple's personal life.
The Netflix film also stars Matt Bomer, Maya Hawke, Sarah Silverman, Josh Hamilton, Scott Ellis, Gideon Glick, Sam Nivola, Alexa Swinton and Miriam Shor.
""Maestro is a towering and fearless love story chronicling the lifelong relationship between Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein,"" an official logline reads. ""A love letter to life and art, Maestro at its core is an emotionally epic portrayal of family and love.""

Scott Stuber, the head of global film at Netflix, told Variety back in December 2021 about Maestro: ""We've done a lot of work on the makeup. We've done a lot of work on the voice. I'm excited to see someone so deeply focused on creating a story that means so much to him. And Carey Mulligan is an incredible actress. We've seen her do such great work. Promising Young Woman was, I thought, one of the best last year.""

Last January, Cooper teased Maestro during a conversation with Mahershala Ali for Variety, explaining he personally ""wanted to be a conductor since I was a kid.""
Cooper said at the time, ""I was obsessed with it, asked Santa Claus for a baton when I was 8. Listening to music, falling in love with it and being able to really know every single moment of a piece, like Tchaikovsky's Opus 35 in D major, this violin concerto. I could do it as if I know everything about it without really being able to speak the language, obviously.""
The actor also explained how he took on the project after director Steven Spielberg was originally attached to it. (Spielberg and Martin Scorsese are among the producers of Maestro.)

""I always knew that Steven Spielberg knew that I had this obsession with conducting,"" said Cooper. ""He had this biopic idea and was talking to me about potentially acting in it. But I had just been working on A Star Is Born. And I said, 'Listen, all I want to do is write and direct movies. I always felt like I could play a conductor, but may I research the material and see if I can write it and direct it? Would you let me do that?' ""

2023-07-14 15:41:39+00:00,How Barbie Took Over the World,"Here’s everything you need to know about how the Barbie movie came to be and the frenzy around its opening, from the soundtrack to the merchandise to the fashion.","You’d be forgiven for thinking only one movie is coming out this year. It’s Barbie’s world, and we’re just living in it. Perhaps we should have anticipated the Barbie craze. After all, more than a billion dolls have been sold worldwide since Barbie’s debut in 1959.
Barbie is 64 years old, and yet this is the first time she’ll star in a live-action movie on the big screen. A Barbie movie has been in the works since at least 2009, but versions with stars like Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer stalled in part because Mattel was nervous about attaching a face and a personality to the doll. Barbie has no inner life on purpose; children are supposed to project their hopes and dreams onto her blank canvas.
Now, director Greta Gerwig is finally bringing not just one but several Barbies to the big screen—many of whom are featured on a recent cover of this magazine. Here’s everything you need to know about how the Barbie movie came to be and the frenzy around its opening, from the star-studded soundtrack to Margot Robbie’s red carpet looks to how the movie’s rivalry with Oppenheimer came to dominate social media. —Eliana Dockterman
What is Barbie about?
The marketing may be inescapable, but Warner Bros. has done a good job of keeping the plot of Barbie under wraps. We’ve seen the movie, and here’s what we can reveal: The film is set in Barbie Land, a utopia where each Barbie has an equally impressive job, ranging from diplomat to scientist to Supreme Court Justice. As Helen Mirren’s narrator wryly tells us, “all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.” The Barbies have sleepovers every night during which they declare how beautiful and confident they feel. The Kens exist as convenient dance partners. But then Margot Robbie’s Barbie begins to think about mortality. Looking for answers, she ventures into the real world with Ryan Gosling’s Ken, who has been feeling like a mere accessory in Barbie’s dream life. The real world is, well, real. Men in suits at Mattel—led by Will Ferrell’s CEO—make disingenuous speeches about female empowerment; tweens dress Barbie down for wreaking havoc on their self-esteem. Both Barbie and Ken go on quests of self-discovery, and that’s when things get really interesting.

The movie doesn’t stick to a single genre: Somehow Barbie is a satire of a toy company’s capitalist ambitions, a searing indictment of the current fraught state of gender relations, a heartwarming if occasionally clichéd tribute to girl power, and a musical spectacle filled with earworms from Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa. And then some. —Eliana Dockterman

Barbie merchandise and marketing
Along with a relentless press tour that has seen Barbies and Kens—or at least the actors playing them—grace the cover of seemingly every magazine (including ours), this summer has also played host to a blitz of Barbie merchandising. Warner Bros. and Mattel have partnered with everyone from Bloomingdales to Pinkberry to roll out pink products. The fashion and makeup collaborations were perhaps to be expected. But Barbie pasta? A Barbie XBox? Barbie and Ken popping up on the Bumble dating app? The scale of this marketing campaign may be unprecedented.
Mattel has engineered tie-ins that range from clothes to beauty to home decor Shoes: Aldo; Float: Funboy; Clip: Kitsch; Jacket: Gap; rug: Ruggable; Skates: Impala Skate
Still, the real reason that predictions for Barbie’s box office have nearly doubled in the last few weeks may have less to do with the fact that you can’t cross a street in a major city without spotting a Barbie ad and more to do with the fact that that ad is pink. Barbie is unapologetically leaning into the feminine aesthetic and courting a female audience—still a rarity in Hollywood. Big budget movies, including Barbie’s rivals at the box office, Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible, tend to be marketed toward a male audience.
But, as Gerwig told TIME in her interview for our cover story, the movie was always going to be at its heart a mother-daughter film. Just about every woman has played with Barbie at some point in her life and has an opinion on the doll, whether they love her or hate her. As the Barbie trailer says, “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” —Eliana Dockterman

More from TIME
The Greta Gerwig of it all
Fans of Gerwig were probably surprised when she signed on to Barbie. What was the writer-director of Lady Bird and Little Women doing filming what could easily turn into a Mattel commercial? But Gerwig told TIME that she was a huge fan of dolls as a kid—she was still playing with them in junior high: “Kids were drinking, and I was playing with dolls.” And she stuffed the film full of ideas—about capitalism, the patriarchy, religion, 1950s Hollywood musicals, and Sylvester Stallone’s sartorial choices, to name just a few.
Robbie, Ana Cruz Kayne, Gerwig, and Nef on the set that caused a global pink-paint shortage Jaap Buitendijk
The folks at Mattel have been notoriously protective of Barbie’s image over the years, and the head of Mattel Films, Robbie Brenner, told the toy company executives they would have to “white knuckle” it through the creative process as Gerwig and producer-star Robbie pushed the limits on how much they could poke fun of the iconic and controversial doll. That led to occasional clashes, including a moment when Mattel President Richard Dickson flew to London to argue with Gerwig and Robbie over a particular scene. Dickson told TIME they changed his mind by performing the scene for him. The resulting film is a mashup of something both uniquely Gerwig, filled with all her quirks, and a project of corporate ambition to sell more dolls. —Eliana Dockterman

The fashion
Though the marketing push surrounding Barbie has been groundbreaking, ubiquitous, and very, very pink, the most memorable part of the film’s promotionmay be the red carpet (ahem, pink carpet) looks sported by star Margot Robbie, who’s taken inspiration from iconic looks worn by the doll over the years. While it could have been easy for Robbie to simply rely on the ultra-pink Barbiecore trend for the film’s press tour, she and stylist Andrew Mukamal instead turned to the style archives of the world’s most famous doll.
From the signature black and white swimsuit and peep toe stiletto mules sported by the first Barbie doll in 1959 to the glamorous glittering black cocktail sheath with matching opera gloves worn by the “Solo in the Spotlight” doll that debuted in 1960, Robbie and Mukamal have found a way to not only channel, but also playfully reinterpret Barbie’s most iconic looks through high fashion collaborations with brands like Schiaparelli, Moschino, and Vivienne Westwood.

With her Barbie homages, Robbie isn’t just delivering exquisite looks or compelling marketing for Mattel—she’s also setting a new and incredibly high bar for what the future of the red carpet looks like. Here’s to a new (and far more playful) era of film promotion. —Cady Lang

The soundtrack
There’s been plenty of buzz around Barbie’s star-studded soundtrack. Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, and Karol G are just a few of the high-profile artists featured on the album, which is executive produced by the superproducer Mark Ronson.
In an interview, Mark Ronson describes what it was like making the album, finding the right collaborators, and jumping on the opportunity to work with Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. “Those two make some of my favorite films,” he says. “I thought, ‘Even if I don’t get this gig, I know this is going to be my favorite movie next year.’” So he signed on to do the project, and he and Gerwig hit the ground running: “I became the Robin to her Batman,” he says.
And after weeks of teasing, Ronson finally revealed that Billie Eilish—who the producer told TIME was “one of the f-cking greatest living artists around”—had contributed a song called “What Was I Made For?”—Moises Mendez II

The power of Ryan Gosling
The movie’s trailer makes the case that Barbie is everything and her male companion is “just Ken.” But it’s clear from the film’s press tour that Ryan Gosling is far more than just Barbie’s main squeeze. Throughout the film’s promotion, Gosling has been anything but plastic—delivering endless charm to journalists and fans alike by talking about how to channel your “Kenergy,” sporting numerous dapper pastel suits, extolling the virtues of director Greta Gerwig (and even wearing a shirt with her name on it), and praising his wife Eva Mendes and their two daughters. While he might not be the titular star of Barbie, Gosling has proven he’s a major player—and a joy and delight—when it comes to generating buzz around the film. —Cady Lang

Barbenheimer mania
What happens when two of the most anticipated films of 2023 debut in the same week? A fan-made movie crossover event known as Barbenheimer.
Barbie will be released on July 21, and so will Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s film about the development of the atomic bomb. Summer movie-goers are relishing the chance to celebrate a one-day cinematic experience of watching two polar-opposite films back-to-back. According to Elizabeth Frank, AMC’s CCO and executive VP of worldwide programming, over 20,000 tickets have been sold so far at AMC Theaters to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day.
The filmmakers and actors from both films are in on the fun, playfully leaning into the crowded film lineup to encourage more people to the movies. Gerwig and Robbie joined in, buying tickets to Oppenheimer, as well as the new Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones movies. Both Nolan and leading man Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer have addressed the frenzy, with Nolan telling IGN, “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.” —Mariah Espada

The geopolitical controversy
Barbie has landed in hot water in some parts of the world for a seemingly innocuous scene featuring a map that critics have alleged depicts the “nine-dash line”—a maritime border that, although rejected by an international tribunal at The Hague, has been used by China to assert ownership of practically all of the South China Sea.
A still image from 'Barbie' that includes a fictional map, which has caused controversy in Southeast Asia. Warner Bros. Pictures
Vietnam authorities banned the movie from being released in the country over the map, which Warner Bros. has said was meant simply to be a “whimsical, child-like crayon drawing” and was “not intended to make any type of statement.” The Philippines, another country that disputes China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, approved Barbie for release—justifying the decision in part by the fact that the line in question has only eight dashes—but requested the map scene be blurred to prevent further misinterpretation.
It’s not clear what exactly eight dashes jutting out the side of a misshapen Asia continent are supposed to represent, but it’s not the first time that this issue has caused controversy in the region, raising questions about the relationship between Hollywood and Beijing—and the extent some studios will go to appease China for access to its massive market.—Chad de Guzman

The movies that inspired Barbie
There are so many references and easter eggs in Barbie it would take multiple viewings to catch every one. The movie isn’t a musical, exactly, but it does have several song-and-dance numbers inspired by the soundstage musicals of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, particularly Gene Kelly films like An American in Paris and Singin’ in the Rain. But Gerwig also drew inspiration from much more contemporary films, and references to movies like The Matrix, Clueless, and even Zack Snyder’s cut of the Justice League find their way into the movie. And Gerwig didn’t stop at studying film. She also extended our interview for the Barbie cover story just to tell me that specific shots in the film were modeled on Michaelangelo’s Creation of Man, which adorns the Sistine Chapel. Like I said, there’s a lot going on in this movie. —Eliana Dockterman

The creator of Barbie
Before there was Barbie, girls mostly played with baby dolls designed to train them to be nurturing mothers. Barbie, dreamt up by Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler, was the first “fashion doll” who had the body and stature of an adult woman. Girls could project their future selves onto the doll rather than care for her. Eventually, they could dress her up to be a doctor, an astronaut, or even president of the United States. Handler named the doll after her daughter Barbara, a tidbit that led Greta Gerwig to ground Barbie in a mother-daughter story.
But Handler was a complicated woman who, as the Barbie film alludes to, was pursued by the IRS. In the movie she’s a god-like figure, even if a flawed one. —Eliana Dockterman

The Barbenheimer box office
Barbie outperformed even the most optimistic prognosticator’s predictions about the movie: The movie earned $337 million worldwide its opening weekend, the biggest debut of 2023 so far and the largest box office victory for a female director in the history of film.
Though it initially seemed like Barbie and Oppenheimer might cannibalize one another at the box office, it turns out that Barbie buoyed the World War II era biopic: According to a poll by The Quorum, 6% of people who saw Oppenheimer did so because Barbie was sold out. Together, they set a post-pandemic record at the box office. Not since Avengers: Endgame premiered in 2019 have so many people flocked to movie theaters. Studios are already scrambling to find lessons about how future films might coax audiences away from streaming services and back to the cinema.—Eliana Dockterman

Held at the The Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, the June 29 show hosted by actress Missi Pyle bestowed over 100 trophies in categories across film and television.

Oppenheimer was awarded in three different categories, taking home Best Drama, Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster, and Best Sound Editing for its trailer. Meanwhile, Barbie came out on top with Best Teaser for the 2001: A Space Odyssey-inspired preview that featured a monumental Margot Robbie as Mattel's very own monolith. Before the plot of the film had even been unveiled, the teaser paying tribute to Stanley Kubrick stirred up plenty of online fanfare.
Winning for Best Action Trailer was John Wick: Chapter 4, the latest entry in the Keanu Reeves' action franchise. The famed fictional hitman may yet return, but the trailer still emulates a certain sense of finality.

2023-08-13 14:55:00+00:00,Greta Gerwig Breaks Global & US Box Office Records For Female Director With ‘Barbie’; Why ‘Demeter’ Deep-Sixed – Sunday Update,"'Barbie' crosses half-billion mark in U.S., while 'Last Voyage of the Demeter' bombs. Greta Gerwig is top grossing female director U.S. of all-time, best for live-action pic worldwide all-time","SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU after Saturday AM update: The momentum of Barbenheimer, as well as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and The Meg 2: The Trench, are propelling a significantly better August than a year ago. The weekend is set to top an estimated $118.5M, +76% from the same frame in 2022 per industry sources.
THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER , Universal Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection
Unfortunately, the tanking of Amblin/Universal’s $45M-costing The Last Voyage of the Demeter stands out like a wart, since we haven’t had many misfires this summer. Granted, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s profitability might be in question next to their exorbitant Covid costs. But these pics have put up tentpole grosses in the nine digits, and have been mass draws (just not as massive as they were hoped to be). Note the filmmakers aimed to keep this period horror pic as cheap as they could: Exteriors were shot in Malta, while interior were shot in Germany, both those countries respectively having tax credits of 50% and 30%.
What makes the $6.5M opening here for Demeter more pronounced is simply given the fact that it’s the only major studio-wide entry this weekend. Note, we’ve known due to tracking that this vampire ship pic was headed for the cliffs.
Look, Amblin makes these elevated genre mid-budget size movies, not necessarily as thrifty as Blumhouse. There was Captive State, which was made for $25M and was released pre-spring 2019 and fell down with a global gross less than $9M. Amblin had some money in that film, but it was largely financed by Participant.
Then there was the under-$10M horror pic, Come Play, which was released when major movie capitals like NYC and L.A. weren’t opened. That grossed $13.1M WW, and I’m told it broke even thanks to vibrant PVOD during the pandemic, and everyone watching at home. Demeter will have to look to the saving grace of downstream ancillaries. Remember, if there’s anything that theatrical day-and-date taught us, it’s that it’s always better to release theatrically, prop the pic’s profile, bomb, and make money thereafter.

Sitting in a movie theater this summer and watching a rhythmic flow of riveting trailers, including not just Barbie and Oppenheimer, but also Sony’s upcoming (what looks-to-be hysterical) holiday romantic comedy, Anyone But You, starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell — then the trailer for Demeter hits the screen and screeches all fun to a halt. What is this overly dark Master and Commander clipper ship type movie? ‘What’s a Demeter?’ one asks. Then two minutes into the trailer, just before you’re about to doze off, one’s response is ‘Oh, it’s about Dracula.’ That was one of the biggest problems I found in the marketing: The trailer was a huge ‘do-not-see-this-movie,’ especially with the non-starry cast (another hurdle for this horror pic).
However, this movie is from the genius marketing team who turned M3GAN into a phenomenon when the country was in a deep-freeze this past winter, and whenever a trailer can’t deliver, it’s because there aren’t enough materials in the film for a studio’s marketing team to harness. It’s not marketing’s fault, it’s the film’s fault. At the end of the day, period horror is a hurdle, as it’s too elevated to excite core 18-34 horror fans, and too low bar to pull in sophisticated audiences — even if you have stars (case in point Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak –$13.1M opening, $31M domestic on a $55M production cost). Filmmaker André Øvredal was able to delight back in early August 2019 with a PG-13 young adult movie, Scary Stories (which by the way, it’s set in 1968, which isn’t as period for a horror movie and a turnoff as clipper ship times).
There is a feeling by some close to the film that the studio got cold feet in propping Demeter this summer. However, audience diagnostics are diagnostics coming out of testing, and marketing budgets are appropriately allocated to those stats as studios look to keep a low overhead on a feature heading into the streaming window.
There were champions of Demeter who tried to get the good word out, i.e. del Toro and Stephen King, who praised the pic on social media:
I enjoyed Last Voyage of the Demeter so much: gorgeous, lavish and savage!! — Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) August 10, 2023
I was doubtful about THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER, but it's a throat-ripping good time. It reminded me of the best of the Hammer movies from the 60s and 70s. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) August 10, 2023
In addition to critics who aren’t fans of Demeter, audiences are asleep, too, with a B- CinemaScore and 66% positive on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak. Guys bought tickets at 62%, 52% of the 18-34 demo was present, and 25-34 year olds were the largest quad at 32%. Diversity mix was 44% Caucasian, 25% Latino and Hispanic, 16% Black, and 16% Asian/other. Demeter played strongest in the South, South Central and West. The annual income for a part-time entry level worker at McDonalds is higher than what this movie made at the AMC Burbank since Thursday (Demeter‘s highest grossing venue) which is under $12.5K so far.
There’s no need for the studio to use the excuse that stars weren’t available to promote because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, for it remains to be seen whether or not they would have moved the meter on this title. The pic’s problems are inherent. As Deadline film critic Valerie Complex points out about Demeter, “The visual palette drenched in melancholic grays and blues are effective in creating atmosphere, but the film falls prey to predictability.” She also observes that her journey on the Demeter “feels longer than it actually is.”
Furthermore, Universal did push Demeter as much as they could. The pic trailered on movies like Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible in-theaters. The trailer trended #10 on YouTube, generated 90+ press breaks, and garnered more than 61M views. Spots ran on such TV shows as American Ninja Warrior, America’s Got Talent, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia finale, Mayans finale, The Walking Dead: Dead City finale, Shark Week, Big Brother premiere, and The Challenge premiere. On streaming, spots ran on such shows as The Bear, What We Do in the Shadows and Only Murders in the Building.
In the sports arena, Demeter floated into a UFC 291 PPV sponsorship (including coveted spot right before the match begins, lower thirds, billboards, announcer callouts), NBA Finals Games 2&5, MLB All-Star Game, WWE RAW, League’s Cup, All Elite Wrestling: Rampage, Boxing PPV Spence v. Crawford Sponsorship, UFC Fight Night, NFL Hall of Game. While on streaming, the campaign also had placements in NBC’s NFL streaming coverage and a sponsorship of Peacock’s WWE Summer Slam.
Despite all noble efforts here by Uni — no one’s buying tickets for a trip on the Demeter. Amblin’s linear cable deal is with Showtime, so Demeter won’t end up on Peacock. Onward to PVOD, Ho!

Some trivia: Sony’s Gran Turismo, which was suppose to come out this weekend but was pushed to Aug. 25 because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, has been playing sneaks, just like the Culver City lot promised. I’m told there were Imax early access screenings on Wednesday, regular sneaks on Thursday. Today, there’s a 2 PM at the Regal North Hollywood, LA Live, and TCL Chinese Theatre. Where will the extra money be counted? I understand it will be in the end-running total. The Playstation Studios movie opened abroad with $10.7M from 4,900+ screens in 30 markets. France led all markets with a strong $2.3 million, followed by the UK with $1.3 million. Australia and Germany both launched with $1.0 million.
The chart is updating with Sunday figures, indicated by Saturday and Sunday figures:
1 Barbie (WB) 4,178 theaters – Fri $10M (-38%) Sat $13.2M Sun $10.5M, 3-day $33.7M (-36%), Total $526.3M/Wk 4

This action comedy in126 markets put up some big numbers in Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco, Austin, NYC, Chicago and LA.
FRIDAY EVENING: We told you earlier the Greta Gerwig directed Barbie is crossing $500M today. As of Tuesday, the film became the highest ever at the domestic box office for a female director, besting Frozen II‘s $477.4M, which was co-directed by Jennifer Lee. Barbie is crossing $1.13 billion worldwide today, also delivering another box office record to Gerwig, as the pic became the highest grossing live-action pic from a female filmmaker on a global basis, besting Captain Marvel‘s $1.13 billion, that title co-directed by Anna Boden.
Barbie crosses the half billion point stateside in 22 days, faster than Top Gun: Maverick (30 days) and Super Mario Bros Movie (31 days). Barbie is only one of 20 titles to ever cross half billion at the domestic box office. She’s set to lead the U.S./Canada box office with $30M this weekend.
‘The Last Voyage of the Demeter’ Courtesy of Universal
Meanwhile, as expected, Amblin/Universal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter is deep-sixing with $6.5M. Critics loated it at 45% Rotten. Audiences haven’t even expressed if they liked it or not on Rotten Tomatoes, which is an ugly sign. RelishMix reports that social media metrics for the period horror pic are tracking under under horror genre norms by 15% at 118.5M across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok combined. It also doesn’t help that the cast can’t promote on an original film on social media. This is a problem that Meg 2 and Teenage Mutant Turtles didn’t face as they were known pieces of IP; they can be sold strictly off their trailers.
RelishMix’s report on Demeter‘s online chatter before opening: “It runs mixed-leaning-positive, as horror fans are applauding Dracula’s ‘badass’ makeover and thrilled that vampires are getting their fangs back, shedding their softer, more cuddly recent depictions. The R-rating is also adding to the anticipation, promising a darker, more intense experience. Aisling Franciosi, has won some hearts from her previous work (GOThrones) — where are a few grumbles about the vampire’s big reveal in the trailer and the film’s dark cinematography, but this isn’t dampening the general enthusiasm — with some jabs about the CGI, while most threads steer positive.”
Here’s the chart:
1 Barbie (WB) 4,178 theaters – Fri $10M (-38%), 3-day $30M (-43%), Total $522.6M/Wk 4
2) Oppenheimer (Uni) 3,761 theaters, Fri $5M (-40%), 3-day $16.8M (-42%), Total $262.2M/Wk 4
3) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Par) 3,950 theaters, Fri $3.9M (-57%), 3-day $14.1M (-50%), Total $71.1M/Wk 2
4) The Meg 2 (WB) 3,604 theaters, Fri $3.5M (-71%), 3-day $12M (-60%), Total $53.5M/Wk 2
5) Last Voyage of the Demeter (Amb/Uni) 2,715 theaters, Fri $2.65M 3-day $6.5M/Wk 1
FRIDAY AM UPDATE: The only new wide release this weekend is Amblin’s period Dracula horror pic The Last Voyage of the Demeter being distributed by Universal. It made $750K last night in previews from showtimes that began at 5PM in 2,350 theaters in what is expected to be an underwhelming 3-day single digit million result for the $45M feature production. The R-rated pic expands to 2,715 theaters today.
That preview result is in the vicinity of last August’s vampire horror movie, The Invitation, which did $775K in previews, a $6.8M opening and $25.1M final domestic.
Why is this period horror film on the calendar? Because it’s from horror filmmaker André Øvredal. He excited the early August box office back in 2019 with Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. That movie from the shuttering CBS Studios label did an amazing $2.3M in previews for what turned out to be a $20.9M No. 2 opening in the face of the second weekend of Hobbs & Shaw. The sleeper PG-13 horror pic did close to $69M in U.S./Canada and $104.5M WW on what was a $25M production cost.
‘Barbie’ Warner Bros. Pictures
You’ll remember, Sony’s Gran Turismo moved off this date and opted for two weeks of sneaks before an Aug. 25 launch in an effort to build word of mouth for the feature take of the Sony Playstation game. No bother, as Warner Bros’ Barbie is expected to reign supreme in weekend 4 with $31.8M as she heads for half-billion stateside today. The Greta Gerwig-directed feature take of the Mattel toy has already cracked the $1 billion worldwide box office mark with just under $32M from China. Barbie did $7.1M yesterday at 4,178 theaters, -3% from Wednesday, for a running total through three weeks of $492.6M.

Universal’s Oppenheimer is also expected to ease -40% in its fourth weekend with around $17.5M at 3,612 theaters. The Christopher Nolan directed three-hour drama in Imax and 70M made an estimated $3.6M yesterday, -3% from Wednesday for a three-week total of $245.4M.
With more theatrical release date changes expected for the rest of 2023, one distribution head wisely remarked this week, “Watch Barbie and Oppenheimer play through Thanksgiving.”
Some box office trivia: Oppenheimer became the highest grossing film at Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre in the venue’s 97-year history hiting $1.53M on Wednesday. That beats the previous record at the venue set by 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens which earned $1.51M after 15 weeks of release. Oppenheimer has been extended at the TCL Chinese Theatre in IMAX 70mm film through the end of August.
“It’s been a historic run for us at the TCL Chinese with weeks of sold-out shows. We’ve added 6am shows for the last four weekends to satisfy audience demand,” says Brett Fellman, executive with the TCL Chinese Theatres.
Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem should also be down around 40% for a near $17M second weekend. Through its first nine days, the Nickelodeon/Point Grey animated pic did $57M at 3,858 theaters. Turtles did $2.7M yesterday, even with Wednesday.
Warner Bros’ The Meg 2: The Trench is eyeing a 60% decline in weekend two for $12M. Week one for the surprise No. 2 pic last weekend is $41.4M. Thursday was $2.1M, -3% from Wednesday, in fourth place for the day at 3,503.
Disney’s Haunted Mansion, booked at 3,740 theaters, made an estimated $1M, +2% from Wednesday for a two-week running total of $47.2M.
The Tamil language action comedy Jailer from Nelson Dilipkumar opened in 375 theaters on Wednesday doing an estimated $961K, followed by $627K yesterday for a two-day of $1.58M.

,Why People Are Dressing Up To See The Barbie Movie,"Fashion is one of the main tools people are using to channel their excitement for the film, and nostalgia for the decades-old toy that’s both celebrated and villainized for its representations of womanhood.","The phenomenon also means that people are revisiting their love for the toy. Only, this time, there’s disposable income. There are also more choices, given the wide range of dolls Mattel has released in recent years after pushes for diversity in the Barbie universe I just really feel like they've really made a Barbie for every single person that would want one,” says Smith. In turn, the Barbie stereotype is being challenged as more people choose to rethink their relationship with the doll through fashion. “People are so focused on what Barbie looks like and not on what she's doing and I think that really says a lot,” says Layla. “I think it’s so amazing that Barbie has taken on so many roles and you’re able to see yourself in Barbie.” Astronaut Barbie. President Barbie. Mermaid Barbie. Pageant Queen Barbie. For Smith, it’s a once-in-a-generation fashion moment. “I think there's something about this full circle moment of everyone being able to do something together and celebrate themselves and each other, that hasn't happened within the movie world ever,” says Smith.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZmluZXJ5MjkuY29tL2VuLXVzLzIwMjMvMDcvMTE0NjgyMDQvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLWZhbnMtd2Vhci1waW5rLWRyZXNzLXVw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-04 12:00:09.801000+00:00,Barbie Director Greta Gerwig Refused to Use CGI for Margot Robbie's Arched Feet Shot,Barbie director Greta Gerwig has revealed that she shut down early discussions about giving Margot Robbie CGI feet to achieve the look of the titular doll's perfectly arched heels.,"Barbie director Greta Gerwig shut down early discussions about giving Margot Robbie CGI feet to achieve the look of the titular doll's perfectly arched heels.
The trailer for Barbie opens with Robbie's character stepping out of a pair of high-heels, only to maintain the Mattel doll's signature arched feet by standing on her tiptoes. The brief clip generated a lot of discussion among viewers, and Gerwig has admitted it was also a major talking point during the movie's early development.
""There was a big discussion in the beginning,"" Gerwig said during a recent appearance on Australian talk show The Project. ""Everyone said, 'Are you going to CGI all the feet?' And I thought, 'Oh god, no! That's terrifying! That's a nightmare.' And [Margot] has the nicest feet. She has these beautiful dancer feet. She should just hang on to that bar and do it just like this.""

As revealed in a recent Time magazine cover story about making the Barbie movie, the seconds-long shot took ""eight takes"" to get right, but Robbie was determined to do it herself. The actress held onto a bar off-camera to keep herself steady while leaving her feet flexed because she doesn't like when someone else portrays her ""hands or feet in an insert shot"".
Barbie will, of course, come crashing down to Earth with a bang (and flat feet) as she is expelled from Barbieland for being a less-than-perfect doll and dropped into the real world to discover the joys and perils of living among humans, including the likes of America Ferrera, Ariana Greenblatt, Connor Swindells, Jamie Demetriou, and Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel.
The shoe shot is not the only Barbie topic that has trended online in recent weeks. The internet has been blowing up with Barbenheimer memes, mashups, and more as people gear up for this summer's most unlikely double bill with the simultaneous release of Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer on July 21.

2023-07-21 13:00:00+00:00,Barbiemania: How Warner Bros. and Mattel Painted the World Pink and Created Marketing Magic,"'Barbie,' the new movie starring Margot Robbie, enjoyed one of the more memorable marketing campaigns in recent memory.","Pink is the new green.
Barbie‘s release in theaters this weekend caps one of the most extensive and impressive marketing campaigns in recent memory. Put another way: Rarely does a film turn into a cultural touchstone before it opens in cinemas. Warner Bros.’ Barbie, which brings to life the world’s most famous fashion doll, is on the short list of exceptions.
In marketing circles, there is what is known as “paid media” and “earned media.” A TV spot for a trailer is considered paid media, for example. Earned media can be buzz on social media or publicity.
“One of the things about theatrical marketing is that it has the opportunity to engage the cultural zeitgeist in an exciting way. Everyone wants to be a part of something,” says Warners global marketing president Josh Goldstine, who also did long stints at Universal and Sony. “I’ve probably worked on 250 movies over the course of my career, including Spider-Man at Sony way back in the day. I haven’t felt this kind of electricity in a long time.”
Selling a summer tentpole is more expensive than ever, and more complicated, amid the proliferation of social media and as the box office continues to find its footing following the pandemic. It’s commonplace for a Hollywood studio to spend just as much, if not more, to market an event pic as it does to actually make the movie. The price tag of a global marketing campaign for a big event title is usually $100 million or more.
Then there are promotional partnership deals, which can be worth tens of millions. Barbie has attracted more than 100 such partners. From custom pink Crocs to a Prada clothing line to hair dryers — and everything in between. Merchants and brands rushed to cash in on Barbie mania, while companies including Progressive Insurance and General Motors used Barbie in custom TV and digital advertisements. All told, these partnerships are worth at least $70 million to Warner Bros. and toymaker Mattel, home of Barbie. And the value of the publicity the film has generated is immeasurable, from local TV news spot to features in Architectural Digest and The New Yorker. Stories about Barbie have become ubiquitous.
Barbie is even expected to boost moviegoing overall and help Christopher Nolan’s new film, Oppenheimer, which opens the same day and chronicles the making of the atomic bomb (the contest between the two event films even has its own moniker, “Barbenheimer“). The two films, along with Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One, were the last summer tentpoles to have largely completed their publicity blitzes before the SAG-AFTRA strike commenced and rendered it impossible for stars to promote their movies.
Rival studio executives commend Warners and Mattel for what they say is a marketing campaign for the ages. “Barbie will be very, very profitable,” says one such source, adding that Warners is wisely focusing on the cool and fun factor, versus nostalgia. The source, who pays close attention to tracking, says social media metrics kept showing gains. So did box office projections. When it first came on official tracking, Barbie was pacing for a healthy $80 million opening. By earlier this week, that number had jumped to a huge $110 million. “People go to movies to have fun. They want a ride,” continues the source.
Warner Bros. and its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, could use a box office win. This summer’s DC superhero pic The Flash will incur a sizable loss after earning less than $268 million to date at the global box office. Shazam! Fury of the Gods, released earlier this year, was also a major disappointment. If it lives up to the hype, Barbie, which cost $145 million to produce before marketing, could be a huge profit generator for WBD. Just as marketing departments come under scrutiny when a film doesn’t work, so are they commended when there’s a win. “It’s like they saved everything for Barbie,” says another rival marketing executive.
Directed by Greta Gerwig, Barbie, which is rated PG-13, isn’t a paint-by-numbers movie; nor was the campaign crafted by Goldstine and his team. The first teaser trailer, which played before Avatar: The Way of Water over the 2022 year-end holidays, was a parody of Stanley Kubrick’s cinematic masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey that replaced the famous monolith with Barbie star Margot Robbie.
The movie’s playful tone came into further focus in early April with the first proper trailer, complete with a viral moment of Robbie’s arched foot stepping out of pink heels. A few weeks later, Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, appeared onstage at CinemaCon 2023 decked out in a pink blazer. Gosling, who was flanked by Robbie, was the toast of the show, introducing the term Ken-ergy that has become a buzzword. And throughout June, there were Barbie floats in gay pride parades across the country.
“Mattel was just an extraordinary partner in terms of collaboration and allowing us to do stuff that was pretty edgy. We wanted to embrace a campaign that was as bold and exciting as the movie that Greta was making,” Goldstine says.
WBD CEO David Zaslav, like his counterparts at other media and entertainment conglomerates, is keen on synergy as another means to keep marketing costs in check. Various divisions across WBD were part of the “Barbie in the Real World” blitz, including a competition series that featured HGTV talent redesigning a home in various Barbie-inspired rooms from across the decades. There was also a summer baking championship on Food Network, while more than 15 networks across the WBD pantheon featured pink logos and other Barbie on-air graphics.
Initially, neither consumers nor Hollywood insiders knew what to expect from Gerwig’s Barbie. In spring of 2022, Warners revealed a first look from the film at CinemaCon, the annual gathering of theater owners and Hollywood studios in Las Vegas. It showed a smiling Barbie sitting in a pink Corvette.
“We saw how it lit up the internet,” Goldstine says. “It was a very telling moment.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbWFya2V0aW5nLWNhbXBhaWduLTEyMzU1MzQ1Mzcv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1tYXJrZXRpbmctY2FtcGFpZ24tMTIzNTUzNDUzNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""Barbie"" director Greta Gerwig said that Mattel wasn't exactly happy about a line calling Barbie a fascist, but the company ultimately let it through.
During one scene in the film, Sasha — a human teenage girl, played by Ariana Greenblatt — calls Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) a fascist. Emotionally reacting to the comment later, Barbie remarks aloud to herself that she couldn't possibly be a fascist because she doesn't ""control the railways or the flow of commerce.""
Gerwig told the New York Times that Mattel, the company that launched Barbie in 1959, wasn't enthusiastic about that particular line of dialogue, though it did eventually make it into the movie.
""It wasn't like I ever got the full seal of approval from [Mattel], like, 'We love it!'"" Gerwig said. ""I got a tentative, 'Well, OK. I see that you are going to do this, so go ahead and we'll see how it goes.' But that's all you need, and I had faith once it was in there and they saw it that they would embrace it, not fight it. Maybe at the end of the day, my will to have it in was stronger than any other will to take it out.""

Mattel did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
The New Yorker previously reported that Richard Dickson, Mattel's COO and president, flew into London on one of many set visits to discuss the dialogue about Barbie's effects on girls' self-esteem with Gerwig and Robbie, who both produces and stars in the film. And Robbie Brenner, the executive producer of Mattel Films, apparently told company leadership that they were going to ""white-knuckle it the whole time"" while watching the film, per Time.
Gerwig told the Times that she felt that it was important to address the societal criticisms of Barbie directly in the film. When it came to the scene where Sasha and her friends pretty unkindly eviscerate Barbie, who has only just learned that her existence did not in fact solve all problems for women, the director felt that it was important to have a ""really smart character"" deliver those arguments directly to to the doll.
""Also, I grew up with a mom who was kind of against Barbie, so that's how I knew all that,"" Gerwig said. ""If you don't give voice to that, then you're nowheresville.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL2JhcmJpZS1mYXNjaXN0LWpva2UtbWF0dGVsLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy0yMDIzLTfSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9iYXJiaWUtZmFzY2lzdC1qb2tlLW1hdHRlbC1ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWctMjAyMy03P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Your Weekly Roundup of Movies: In the Battle Between “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie,” Cinema Wins",,"OPPENHEIMER
**** At the start of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, raindrops fall; at the end, fire rages. You’ll feel it burn long after the end credits roll. Nolan has made violent movies before (including Inception and Dunkirk), but Oppenheimer is not just about physical devastation. It submerges you in the violence of a guilt-ravaged soul, leaving you feeling unsettled and unclean. Confronting the film’s moral and spiritual weight is a fearsome challenge, and one well worth rising to.
With agitated charisma and vulnerability, Cillian Murphy embodies J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist whose mind birthed the atomic bomb. When we first meet him, he’s a curly-haired lad staring at a puddle, but he swiftly evolves into an excitable visionary leading a cadre of scientists into the deserts of New Mexico, where they will ultimately build and test a plutonium device (referred to as “the gadget”) on July 16, 1945.
While Nolan exists a world apart from Oppenheimer—his creativity far exceeds his fascination with destruction—he has absorbed some of his subject’s frantic energy. Attempting to squeeze decades of a man’s intellectual and emotional life into a mere three hours, Nolan sometimes reduces moments to fragments, egged on by Ludwig Göransson’s eerie and pulsating score (which is excellent but overused).
What saves the film from becoming a connect-the-dots biopic is Nolan’s ingenious chronicle of the post-World War II rivalry between Oppenheimer and Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The more Oppenheimer fights to put “the nuclear genie back in the bottle,” the more Strauss seethes and schemes, thrusting the movie into a maze of double-crosses that echo the exhilarating games of perception in Nolan’s 2001 breakout hit Memento.
Of course, the thrill can’t (and shouldn’t) last. A decade ago, I applauded jubilantly as Nolan wrapped his Dark Knight trilogy, but Oppenheimer left me silent and still. As many as 226,000 people were killed when the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they haunt the film like ghosts—especially when Oppenheimer imagines a charred corpse beneath his foot. A man dreamed; people died. All a work of art can do is evoke their absence. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

BARBIE
*** Once upon a time, Barbie dolls liberated all women from tyranny. The end…at least according to the first few minutes of Barbie, a sleek and satirical fantasia from director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Set in the utopian kingdom of Barbieland, the movie dramatizes the existential crises of the winkingly named Stereotypical Barbie. She’s played by Margot Robbie, who was last seen battling a rattlesnake in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon—and her misadventures in Barbie are hardly less bizarre. Plagued by flat feet, cellulite and fears of death, Barbie seeks the source of her ailments in the real world, bringing along a beamingly inadequate Ken (Ryan Gosling) with catastrophic consequences: Awed by images of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, Ken becomes a crusading men’s rights activist, leading a revolt against the government of Barbieland and instituting bros-first martial law. And they say originality is dead! With its absurdist wit, glitzy musical numbers, and earnest ruminations on whether matriarchy and patriarchy can coexist, Barbie is easily one of the most brazen movies released by a major studio. Yes, its tidy ending betrays its anarchic spirit—after insisting that empowerment can’t be neatly packaged in a doll box, the film seems to say, “No, wait! It can!”—but it would be churlish to deny the charm of Gerwig’s buoyant creation. In an age when genuine cinematic joy is rare, we’re all lucky to be passengers in Barbie’s hot-pink plastic convertible. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Academy, Bagdad, Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Fox Tower, Laurelhurst, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, St. Johns Twin, Studio One, Wunderland Milwaukie.
AFIRE
**** In the tradition of his many compromised romances (Phoenix, Transit, Undine), writer-director Christian Petzold explores connections missed, made and retroactively illuminated during a novelist’s work-cation on the Baltic Sea in Afire. In black denim and gray New Balances, Leon (Thomas Schubert) is practically in uniform as someone who hates the beach. He’s destined to miss out, but the audience doesn’t. Petzold lets us enjoy Leon’s companions—his friend Felix (Langston Uibel), their unexpected housemate Nadja (Paula Beer) and a local lifeguard (Enno Trebs)—and Germany’s north coast. All the while, Leon frets over his manuscript, and a forest fire rages in the distance. Dreamy yet frustrated, blunt yet forgiving, Afire holds space for modern life’s many scales—a creative’s navel-gazing, less selfish characters’ acceptance of provincial life, existential dread. Reveling in Nadja’s beauty, intelligence and generosity (she’s always making goulash), Petzold keeps challenging the audience with Leon’s shaky grip on protagonist status. Often, this sour lump is the last character whose vantage point you’d want in this film, but that’s all part of Petzold’s ever-fascinating “both/and” filmmaking. People will still take meaningful vacations as the world burns; a bad writer can tell a good story; and Nadja will offer Leon a welcoming smile because they’ve shared a deeply imperfect moment. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room.
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE
**** Danger is a drug—and in his third Mission: Impossible film, director Christopher McQuarrie simultaneously shoves it up your nostrils and stabs it into your veins. As usual, daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is chasing after an explosive MacGuffin that he must protect from a doomsday-loving maniac (Esai Morales, in this case) lest the world go boom. Rather than vary the formula, McQuarrie simply refurbishes it (brilliantly) with fresh flourishes of suspense. You’ve seen Ethan race against the clock, but you’ve never seen him rushing through an airport in Abu Dhabi during a countdown to a nuclear explosion. You’ve seen him in one-on-one fights, but never with a demented French swordswoman (Pom Klementieff) in a terrifyingly cramped alley in Venice. You’ve seen him battle his adversaries on trains, but never run through one as it tumbles into…oh, just see the movie already, will you? Dead Reckoning Part One isn’t just cinema. It’s the essence of everything cinema was made for—not just triumphantly tense violence, but delicious glamour and sex appeal (a nighttime negotiation with Alanna Mitsopolis, a broker played with a lascivious grin by Vanessa Kirby, is nearly erotic enough to deserve an NC-17 rating). And while the apparent death of a main character strikes a sour note—these films work best when they’re disposable and delightful, not tragic and ruthless—I’m hopeful that it’s a red herring designed to goose our sympathies before Part Two arrives next year. It wouldn’t be the first time that a Mission: Impossible movie has manipulated its audience to irresistibly grand effect. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Academy, Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, City Center, Eastport, Fox Tower, Joy Cinema, Lake Theater, Laurelhurst, Lloyd Center, Mill Plain, Pioneer Place, St. Johns Theater, St. Johns Twin, Studio One, Wunderland Milwaukie.
PAST LIVES
**** As Nora (Greta Lee) is about to share a first kiss with her future husband, Arthur (John Magaro), she explains the Korean phrase in-yun—fate’s hand in human connection and reconnection. Intentionally or not, she’s referring just as much to Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), her best friend and crush from before she immigrated from Seoul to Canada. Ever since, Hae Sung has reappeared to Nora like a 12-year comet, and in director Celine Song’s Past Lives, Hae Sung visits Nora in present-day Brooklyn. Both unambiguous romance and genre experiment, Past Lives sustains itself on love’s textures and musings: endless gazes, mirrorlike skyscrapers, a twinkling synth score (by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen), and a vibrant but melancholy obsession with New York City. Gorgeous 30-somethings who can’t keep guileless vulnerability off their faces, these characters aren’t looking to blow up their lives for the sake of movie contrivances, but through every private conversation, they’re drawn to discussing the same narrative possibilities on the audience’s minds. Who is the right lover in a story sense? Even Arthur wonders. Are in-yun and Nora’s brief, almost multiversal encounters with Hae Sung potent enough to alter the years in between? And when she glimpses the past in his kind, mournful eyes, is she dreaming or seeing? PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room.
JOY RIDE
** In a seeming attempt to reflect the diverse array of untold Asian narratives—a shared pressure among many Asian American artists—Joy Ride accomplishes the opposite, offering a rushed 90 minutes overcrowded by underdeveloped characters and plot turns. Adopted Chinese American Audrey (Ashley Park) travels to her birth country for the first time, along with two eccentric best friends, Kat (Stephanie Hsu), a Chinese soap opera actor hiding her sexual past from her God-fearing virgin fiancé, and Lolo (Sherry Cola), a fledgling artist who makes playground models resembling genitalia to “get the conversation going” (Lolo also brings along her BTS-obsessed cousin, played by a wide-eyed, scene-stealing Sabrina Wu). Audrey’s business trip to China quickly turns into a cross-continental search for her birth mother, and the film sharply illustrates certain minority challenges—internalized shame, dissonance between internal and external perceptions of self. Yet its efforts to provide a comprehensive cultural education (the work of not one, but many, many more representative films) result in stilted dialogue and a hasty denouement. The comedy’s saving grace lies in its effectively over-the-top humor; filled with riotous bits and clever one-liners, Joy Ride promises to leave the audience feeling lighter than before they entered the theater. And, sometimes, that’s all we need from a movie. R. ROSE WONG. Eastport, Fox Tower.
QUICKSAND
* A bickering couple on the brink of divorce gets stuck in a muddy hole in the forests of Colombia in Quicksand. Carolina Gaitan and Allan Hawco play Sofia and Josh, health care professionals who have journeyed to the country to assist a friend. After going on a hike and winding up in an area they were warned about, Sofia and Josh end up in a fight for their lives. The two have to put aside their differences in order to survive the ordeal, but Matt Pitts’ screenplay never rings true as it jumps from scene to scene. Quicksand could have worked as a survival scenario crossed with a therapy session, but the couple’s conflict feels underwritten and their inept decision making makes it hard to root for them. Director Andres Beltran tries to overcome the thin screenplay by overselling many scenes with music and style; many sequences are well shot, but the messy editing often betrays the images. Quicksand does provide some minor enjoyment with unintentional laughs (some involving a snake), but most of the time the film is alternately boring and annoying. NR. DANIEL RESTER.

2023-08-08 16:14:41-04:00,‘We don’t want to be Kenemies’: Movie theatre releases trailer appealing for return of stolen Barbie poster,A movie theatre in Oakville decided to get creative after their security cameras captured the theft of a promotional poster for the Barbie movie over the weekend.,"A movie theatre in Oakville decided to get creative after their security cameras captured the theft of a promotional poster for the Barbie movie over the weekend.
Film.ca Cinemas, located on Speers Road, posted a satirical movie trailer titled “Barbie Heist” to their Facebook page, which appears to show a male suspect stealing three posters from their display cases at the front of the theatre.
The cinema says the theft occurred just after 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, and the thief made away with a poster for the Barbie movie, ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ and ‘Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part one.’
Film.ca CEO Jeff Knoll told CP24 on Tuesday that they released the trailer in the hopes that the thief would bring the posters back, but so far, they’ve had no luck.
“The video just went up yesterday and we're hopeful that somebody will step forward and return the posters,” he said. “More importantly, the message we're trying to deliver is; please stop victimizing our theater.”
Knoll says that the theatre has dealt with a number of vandalism incidents over the past few years, including the theft of two ATM boxes which were dragged out with chains, damaging the theatre’s front doors, as well as the slashing of multiple cinema screens.
“We've had graffiti, we've had property theft, catalytic converter theft, we’ve just had a string of things happen to us since the pandemic and we just really want to say enough is enough,” he added.
“If you're going to come after us, we're going to make you famous, effectively.”
Knoll says he deliberately hasn’t gone to the police with a theft complaint because he doesn’t want to tie up their resources with what he says is a relatively minor crime.
“We've gone to the police with most of the previous ones, but this is a fairly petty theft and I happen to also serve on the Halton Police Board and I know how expensive our police resources are,” Knoll said.
“So I've made the decision not to pursue it through a police investigation that would cost thousands of dollars. I think that the punishment in this particular case is this person, his friends and family are going to know who he is from the video, I don't think there's any question about that.”
Knoll says the posters were initially provided to the theatre free of charge from the film’s production studio, but cost about $25 each to replace.
“But the poster like the Barbie poster would sell on eBay or Kijiji or one of those auction sites for quite a bit more because that's a popular movie,” he added.
“Maybe not so much the Haunted Mansion poster, which is why that one was left behind.”
The thief was also apparently not interested in the poster for Christopher Nolan’s latest blockbuster, ‘Oppenheimer,’ as it was also left behind.
Knoll delivered an on-air message to the alleged poster thief on Tuesday afternoon, saying the cinema simply wants its posters back.
“You made a bonehead move, we're tired of these things happening to our business. Bring the posters back, and, you know, we'll let bygones be bygones,” he said.
“But make no mistake about it, if you're going to victimize our business, you're going to be called out on it.”
Based on the security footage provided by the theatre, the alleged thief appears to be an adult male, wearing a white hooded sweatshirt, with a baseball cap, grey shorts and crocs. The suspect was also seen driving away in a black hatchback.
“To the Barbie thief,” said Knoll in the Barbie Heist trailer, “if you’re watching, we don’t want to be Kenemies, if you would kindly return the posters, that would be more than Kenough.”
“But we do want an answer to the question; did you really not see the cameras?”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcDI0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlLWRvbi10LXdhbnQtdG8tYmUta2VuZW1pZXMtbW92aWUtdGhlYXRyZS1yZWxlYXNlcy10cmFpbGVyLWFwcGVhbGluZy1mb3ItcmV0dXJuLW9mLXN0b2xlbi1iYXJiaWUtcG9zdGVyLTEuNjUxMDg2MtIBMmh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YS5jcDI0LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvOC84LzFfNjUxMDg2Mi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-05 18:00:00+00:00,Read America Ferrera's Full Barbie Movie Monologue,Gloria's speech about how it is impossible to be a woman is one of the most talked-about scenes from Greta Gerwig's blockbuster film.,"Spoilers ahead for Barbie.
One of the highlights of Greta Gerwig's Barbie comes in the second half of the film, when Gloria (America Ferrera) delivers a monologue on the impossible double standards of being a woman.
The monologue, Ferrera told Vanity Fair, was ""one of the first things Greta mentioned to me even before I read the script. She said, 'I wrote this monologue for Gloria, and I've always imagined you saying this.' While that was flattering, it also felt like pressure in the nicest way. I read the monologue and it hit me as powerful and meaningful. It also felt like, wow, what a gift as an actor to get to deliver something that feels so cathartic and truthful. But it also felt like this pivotal moment that I obviously didn't want to mess up. There was a little bit of healthy pressure around it.""
It took them two days to shoot the scene, and Ferrera says she probably did ""30 to 50 full runs of it, top to bottom."" Her favorite line, she says, is the ""always be grateful"" line, which she worked on together with Gerwig.
During her performance, Gerwig tells The Atlantic, ""When America was giving her beautiful speech, I was just sobbing, and then I looked around, and I realized everybody’s crying on the set. The men are crying too, because they have their own speech they feel they can’t ever give, you know? And they have their twin tightrope, which is also painful.""
Read Gloria's full monologue from Barbie (2023):
It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.
You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people.
You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.
But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful.
You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.
I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9sZWlzdXJlL2FydHMtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvYTQ0NzI1MDMwL2FtZXJpY2EtZmVycmVyYS1iYXJiaWUtZnVsbC1tb25vbG9ndWUtdHJhbnNjcmlwdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The most recent trailer for Barbie saw the iconic doll enter the ""real world"" outside Barbie Land, as she's offered the opportunity to ""know the truth"" about the world outside.
Alongside Robbie and Gosling, the movie boasts and impressive cast that includes Arrested Development's Michael Cera, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu, Insecure's Issa Rae, Superstore's America Ferrera, and Sex Education's Emma Mackey, Ncuti Gatwa and Connor Swindells.
Robbie recently revealed the one request she made when she signed on for the film, namely one piece of iconic Barbie gear.

2023-08-18 00:12:00+00:00,"Two Bates faculty experts explain ‘Barbie,’ from shelf to screen and everything in between",,"She’s 64 years old, but never ages. She’s a global phenomenon, switching careers like a pair of shoes. She has been lauded as empowering, and condemned for promoting an unrealistic body image. And now she’s on the big screen in a big way.
Since its July release, director Greta Gerwig’s Barbie has raked in more than $1.2 billion worldwide, making Gerwig the first solo female director with a billion-dollar movie.
We asked two Bates professors, Jon Cavallero and Erica Rand, to give us the lowdown on what’s up with the doll, from shelf to screen and everything in between, from their areas of expertise: Cavallero is an associate professor of rhetoric, film, and screen studies, and Rand is a professor of art and visual culture and gender and sexuality studies.
Rand has more than a passing interest in all things Barbie. In 1995, she published the book Barbie’s Queer Accessories, an examination of the doll, including its appropriation by children and adults using Barbie in very un-Mattel-authorized ways.
“One big ‘queers-come-hither’ moment in the trailer is when Barbie drives along in her Barbie convertible belting out ‘Closer to Fine’ by the Indigo Girls.” Erica Rand
Many anticipated that Barbie might have overt feminist and queer themes with Gerwig and actor Margot Robbie, as Barbie, at the helm. The latter co-founded the female-focused production company LuckyChap, and the former’s movies, such as Lady Bird, have a reputation for feminist disruption.
The pre-release marketing hinted at such themes, says Rand. “One big ‘queers-come-hither’ moment in the trailer is when Barbie drives along in her Barbie convertible belting out ‘Closer to Fine’ by the Indigo Girls, a classic in the lesbian-girl-with-guitar genre, and it comes up repeatedly in the movie.”
But a nod is as far as it goes, says Rand. “It would be a very different Barbie movie if any character identified the song’s queer fanbase. But the film’s camp sensibility and some glorious queer moments, like the all-Ken production number, should not be overlooked.”
There are other queer moments, including the casting of Hari Nef, a transgender actor, as Doctor Barbie. And, Rand adds, the movie does take on “damaging and contradictory gender expectations.” Still, most of the queerness in the movie’s trailer could be considered “gay window advertising,” Rand told NBC News, where advertisers nod to queer audiences but in a subtle enough way that naysayers don’t notice.
“Queer is partly what you make it; it also isn’t whatever you make of it,” Rand says. “I have to say that I was disappointed — especially amid all that was feminist about it — in the persistent gender binary,” Rand said. “[In the movie,] dolls are Barbie or Ken, people are men or women. No one’s asking anyone their pronouns.”
Rand also noted that — as in Barbie’s plastic world — the primary Barbie and Ken remain white. “The film can call the main characters ‘Stereotypical Barbie’ and ‘Stereotypical Ken’ but that doesn’t change the predominant importance of white characters.”
At Bates, Jon Cavallero teaches film theory, among other courses, and is the author of Hollywood’s Italian American Filmmakers: Capra, Scorsese, Savoca, Coppola, and Tarantino. Every other year, he and his students produce the Bates Film Festival.
“[Barbenheimer] frames Barbie as the silly movie and Oppenheimer as the serious one. That does a disservice to Barbie, Greta Gerwig, and Margot Robbie.” Jon Cavallero
He, too, has thought about Barbie through the lens of the audience experience, including how the bright pink Barbie and its fellow opening weekend blockbuster, Oppenheimer, a grim thriller about the birth of the nuclear age, became an internet pop-culture mashup meme: “Barbenheimer,” with fans making plans to see both as a unique cinematic experience.
He recalls how a former student recently told him that friends were urging him to see Barbie and Oppenheimer back to back because, they said, “you’re such a film guy.” Cavallero’s response to his former student flipped the script. “Because you’re the film guy, you have to watch them separately.” In other words, “you have to give them their own space to let them breathe.”
The Barbenheimer mashup does a disservice to the talents of Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, says John Cavallero. (Warner Bros.)
The Barbenheimer mashup, Cavallero argues, creates a troubling binary, in this case “framing Barbie as the silly movie and Oppenheimer as the serious one. That does a disservice to Barbie, Greta Gerwig, and Margot Robbie — an incredibly talented actress who has worked with well-known male directors who don’t make full use of her talent.”
Far too often, Cavallero says, directors “place Robbie in front of the camera and let it merely capture her beauty. Check out her Oscar-nominated performances in Bombshell and I, Tonya or her turn as Nellie LaRoy in last year’s Babylon to get a sense of her range and skill.”
While Barbie’s queer content exists mostly as winks and nods, Rand finds a nod to another identity almost more interesting. That happens with the nonfictional character Ruth Handler, who Mattel now advertises as the inventor of Barbie — though that origin story is not completely true, says Rand — and who appears in the movie, as “a fairy-godmother of sorts, a guide to freedom and human feeling,” she says.
“The meaning of cultural products always depends partly on what consumers bring to them.” Erica Rand
Handler, who died in 2002 and was Jewish, “is played as an implicitly Jewish grandmotherly type by the actor Rhea Perlman, also Jewish,” Rand says. “Noting that queer and ethnic content — and content producers — have intertwined histories of erasure, I find it interesting that Jewish content dwells even more at the level of suggestion than queer content.”
Cultural critic and author Erica Rand published Barbie’s Queer Accessories in 1995.
Rand points out that when pondering, attending, or reflecting on a movie like Barbie, you have to acknowledge the audience, because “the meaning of cultural products,” whether a doll or a Hollywood blockbuster, “always depends partly on what consumers bring to them.”
For example, she notes, “I might consider Barbie as an ad for the cisgender binary, but others might bring different interpretations and experiences to it, including their history of encountering Barbie and Barbie products.” Many people, she notes, remember making Barbie genderqueer as children or might now think of Mattel’s Laverne Cox doll as transgender Barbie. “The many queer and trans fans of the doll and the film teach me not to make pronouncements that quantify queerness.”
Whether Barbie or Oppenheimer, movies are complex cultural products, often disconcerting and contradictory, yet they still “can unite us in a way that few other things can,” says Cavallero. “This idea is at the core of the Bates Film Festival: Movies are among an increasingly rare number of spaces where people from different backgrounds and perspectives can come together and they can use their reaction to a film to discuss more controversial social and political issues.”
Notwithstanding the cinematic excellence that Gerwig and Robbie have delivered in Barbie, Cavallero sounds a warning note about the continued rise of the movie franchise. “One way to judge the strength of a studio is to identify which franchises they control,” he said.
Paramount, for example, “controls Star Trek, Mission Impossible, Transformers, and other Hasbro IP, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They’ve resurrected Top Gun and they’ve got all the Nickelodeon stuff, like PAW Patrol.”
Movies are just the start of franchising. “It’s merchandising: books, lunch boxes, action figures, video games, and bedsheets. The list goes on. It’s a juggernaut. And certainly Mattel and Warner Media are hoping Barbie will be the start of a long line of movies and other products that bring more profit to their multi-billion dollar companies.”
The worry, however, is a future where filmmakers are forced to recycle something — a character like Top Gun’s Maverick Mitchell — in order to tell a new movie story.
Cavallero compares Barbie with the acclaimed movie A Thousand and One, which won the Sundance Film Festival’s grand jury prize. “It’s a film about a lot of things: a Black family in New York, gentrification, the power of Black women, the foster care system, the bond between mother and child.”
A movie with such topical and challenging themes “is hard to sell. With Barbie, you don’t have to do a lot of selling. People already have an idea of what the movie is about, although some viewers have become angry and dismissive when the film resisted their expectations.”
Of course, Cavallero says, it’s not completely either/or. “It would be silly to say that all sequels and franchise films are terrible. They’re not.” The worry, however, is a future where filmmakers are forced to recycle something — a character like Top Gun’s Maverick Mitchell — in order to tell a new movie story.
If that happens, asks Cavallero, “to what extent are you limiting the possibilities — not just of the medium and the art form but also the artists who are working within it? Where are the original characters?”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdGVzLmVkdS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDgvMTgvdHdvLWJhdGVzLWZhY3VsdHktZXhwZXJ0cy1leHBsYWluLWJhcmJpZS1mcm9tLXNoZWxmLXRvLXNjcmVlbi1hbmQtZXZlcnl0aGluZy1pbi1iZXR3ZWVuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-10 19:17:19+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Banned, Pulled From Theaters - Inside the Magic","'Barbie' has officially been banned in one country, and looks set to be banned in another in the upcoming days.","Not everyone is a Barbie girl living in a Barbie world. Two countries have officially moved to ban the billion-dollar blockbuster.
If one film could be described as the runaway hit of the year, it’s Barbie (2023). Directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie as the world-famous Mattel doll (and Ryan Gosling as “Just Ken”), the film documents its eponymous character’s journey from Barbie Land to the real world – as well as what it really means to be a woman.
Since its release in the United States on July 21, the film has struck a chord with critics and audiences alike. As of August 6, it became the first film led by a solo female director to pass $1 billion at the box office. It’s been a rough financial year for Warner Bros. (the less said about The Flash (2023), the better), but the film also proved itself to be the studio’s fastest earner of all time, even beating out the Harry Potter franchise.
It’s also generated plenty of Oscar buzz, despite the 2024 Academy Awards technically still being seven months away, with many theorizing acting nods for Gosling and Robbie, as well as the potential for Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (the real question is whether it will sit in the “Original” or “Adapted” category). If the Academy has taste, “I’m Just Ken” will get a nod for Best Original Song, too.
However, not everyone has warmed to the film. As we previously reported, Barbie was previously delayed until August 31 in the Middle East, with some questioning whether it would even be released at all. The film has since been released on August 10 in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain – but other countries in the region have decided to pull it from theaters entirely.
Late on August 9, Kuwait announced via local news agency Kuna that Barbie has been banned as it promotes “ideas and beliefs that are alien to the Kuwaiti society and public order.”
Barbie may also be banned in Lebanon. The country’s Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada stated the film “[contradicts] values of faith and morality” and forwarded a request to prevent its release to Lebanon’s General Security agency, which will make the final verdict. The film was previously also banned in Vietnam due to its inclusion of a map featuring China’s territorial claim to the South China Sea.
In the United Arab Emirates, Barbie is already breaking records a day into its release. Multiple movie theaters have reported record levels of demand, beating out the likes of Oppenheimer (2023), Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part One (2023), and Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3. (2023).

,Greta Gerwig Reveals It Was Suggested She Cut Emotional ‘Barbie’ Scene Where Margot Robbie Cries,"A quietly emotional moment in Greta Gerwig's ‘Barbie’ was almost cut by Mattel Films and Warner Bros., but the writer-director refused","Greta Gerwig stuck to her guns when it came to a key moment in Barbie.
Crafting a big-screen adaptation about the iconic doll meant the Academy Award-nominated writer-director had to balance her vision with the demands of production company Mattel Films and distributor Warner Bros. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gerwig revealed that the powers that be asked her to consider cutting a scene that she called “the heart of the movie,” depicting Margot Robbie’s Barbie having a tearful moment sitting on a bench with an older woman.
“It’s a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way — it doesn’t lead anywhere,” Gerwig, 39, admitted. “And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, ‘Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.’ And I said, ‘If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about.’”
Robbie’s scene partner, Oscar-winning costume designer Ann Roth, plays a stranger who greets Barbie at the bus stop as she’s taking in the overwhelming world outside the utopian Barbie Land. When the emotional Barbie calls her beautiful, she responds with a laugh: “I know it.”
“The way Margot plays that moment is so gentle and so unforced,” Gerwig told Rolling Stone. “There’s the more outrageous elements in the movie that people say, ‘Oh, my God, I can’t believe Mattel let you do this,’ or, ‘I can’t believe Warner Bros. let you do this.’ But to me, the part that I can’t believe that is still in the movie is this little cul-de-sac that doesn’t lead anywhere — except for, it’s the heart of the movie.”
She added that Roth, the costume designer behind The English Patient, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and over 100 more films, is “a legend… I love that scene so much.”

In an interview with the New York Times, Gerwig responded to an interpretation of the scene that Roth’s character is a godlike figure guiding Robbie’s Barbie on her journey of self-discovery in the real world. “The idea of a loving God who’s a mother, a grandmother — who looks at you and says, ‘Honey, you’re doing ok’ — is something I feel like I need and I wanted to give to other people,” she said, calling their interaction a “transaction of grace.”
Although it’s now 2023’s highest-grossing opener — and set the record for biggest debut ever for a female filmmaker — cowriting the movie with partner Noah Baumbach was a ""terrifying"" prospect for Gerwig, she admitted in a November 2022 interview on Barbie star Dua Lipa's At Your Service podcast.
""There's something about starting from that place where it's like, 'Well, anything is possible,'"" she explained. ""It felt like vertigo, starting to write it. Where do you even begin? And what would be the story?""
She continued: “That feeling that I had was knowing that it would be really interesting terror. Usually, that's where the best stuff is, when you're like, 'I am terrified of that.' Anything where you're like, 'This could be a career-ender,' then you're like, 'Okay, I probably should do it.'""
Speaking with PEOPLE for a special Barbie issue (out now) alongside Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, America Ferrera and more cast members, Gerwig said she hopes the film ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies… I want to go back to Barbie Land.”
Barbie is in theaters now.

2023-08-10 15:00:04+00:00,Let's not forget the real star of Barbie: shameless product placement | Amelia Tait,"The film is like a Russian doll of adverts – is this the future of blockbuster cinema?, says features writer Amelia Tait","Did you know that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is a 114-minute advert for the toy company Mattel? Of course you did. You don’t have to be Detective Barbie to figure that one out. Yet you may have missed that the film is not just an advert: it’s an advert containing multiple other adverts. It’s a Matryoshka of adverts, each one nestled within the next, all contained within a giant, plastic doll.
Watching the film, I rolled my eyes at the starring role played by a spotless Chevrolet 4x4, and laughed aloud at the way the camera focused on Barbie’s (empowering!) heart-shaped Chanel bag. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, wears three TAG Heuer watches at once at one point, and I instantly knew Mattel would sell the “I am Kenough” hoodie he sported at the end (although my cynicism didn’t stretch to imagining its £58 price tag).
Product placement in film is by no means new (some date it back to the presence of Red Crown gasoline in the 1920 silent comedy The Garage), but it seems to have picked up in pace – and shamelessness – in recent years. In 2015, the BBC asked whether it had gone too far in the James Bond franchise. But at least that was based on a series of books. Now, you can put adverts for watches, cars and handbags inside an advert for dolls. And it doesn’t stop there.
In early August, reviewers noted the “bizarre” and “brazen” presence of brands in Disney’s comedy horror film Haunted Mansion, which – like Pirates of the Caribbean before it – is based on one of the company’s rides. Haunted Mansion includes shout-outs to Amazon, Yankee Candle, CVS, Baskin-Robbins and Burger King – never mind that, like Barbie, the film was already an ad. (Disney did not respond to an email asking it to confirm or deny product placements in the movie.)
The trouble with all of this is that it appears to work. Auto Trader reported a 120% increase in interest for Chevy Corvettes after the Barbie trailer dropped, while TAG Heuer’s CEO has claimed that customers are nicknaming one of its models the “Barbie watch”. As of June 2022, product placement is now a $23bn (£18bn) industry globally – a 14% growth in just two years. In an era of skippable ads, companies are clamouring to be featured inside movies and shows.
Yet if brands don’t boast about it, it can often be tricky to find out whether they did indeed pay (or provide free products in exchange) for promotion in a film. Other kinds of collaborations are even murkier. It didn’t occur to me, for example, to question a nod to the language-learning app Duolingo in the Barbie film. The company’s press office told me the gag wasn’t paid for, but Duolingo did collaborate with Mattel and Warner Bros, creating an ad that runs before the film in cinemas. Duo, the brand’s owl mascot, was invited to the LA film premiere.
Meanwhile, I was convinced that the suspiciously sharp logo on Barbie’s Birkenstocks proved that the company had paid for placement in the film, but Birkenstock told me it did not collaborate with Mattel, Warner Bros or any of Barbie’s actors. According to Barbie costume designer Jacqueline Durran, Birkenstocks were in the script “from the beginning” thanks to the writer-director Greta Gerwig. The sandal company has benefited regardless, as Google searches for “women’s Birkenstocks” have soared 518% in the UK since the film’s release; the company is now considering going public with an alleged $8bn (£6.3bn) valuation.
Ironically, it can feel more authentic to include multiple brands in movies, because brands are everywhere in our real lives. And while spotting product placement once elicited a groan, audience resistance might be relenting. Earlier this year, the advertising company BENlabs published a survey into the UK market it had conducted that found 88% of respondents “experience positive emotions” after seeing brands in TV shows, with 60% saying they have searched for a product they’ve seen on TV.
It’s important to take this kind of polling with a pinch of salt, but what’s clear is which way the industry is going. You may not have heard of BENlabs, but it may well have been inside your brain. This is the company that put KFC into Stranger Things, Dunkin’ Donuts into Orange is the New Black and Skype into The Mindy Project. It and other companies are also trying their hand at virtual product placement, a technique in which brands can be added into content post-production, meaning you could theoretically swap out a cereal box for different markets or even add new products into old films.
Product placement regulation isn’t the same everywhere. In the UK, it has only been allowed in British TV since 2010 and any episodes need to feature an Ofcom-mandated logo. But these distinctions matter less and less in a world of ubiquitous American streaming platforms. Barbie and Haunted Mansion are movies already banking on pre-existing IP (intellectual property), Hollywood’s favourite letters. Nike, Tetris and Blackberry are just some of the companies whose origin stories or products have been dramatised in films this year.
About 65% of people skip online video ads and TV viewing is now at its lowest since Ofcom records began, so ostensibly viewers are watching fewer adverts than ever. I fear that, in reality, all we’re watching is ads.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvYXVnLzEwL2JhcmJpZS1zaGFtZWxlc3MtcHJvZHVjdC1wbGFjZW1lbnQtZmlsbS1hZHZlcnRzLWdsb2JhbC1jaW5lbWHSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIzL2F1Zy8xMC9iYXJiaWUtc2hhbWVsZXNzLXByb2R1Y3QtcGxhY2VtZW50LWZpbG0tYWR2ZXJ0cy1nbG9iYWwtY2luZW1h?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-30 06:24:00+00:00,"‘Barbie’, ‘Oppenheimer’ & ‘Haunted Mansion’ Fuel Record Final Weekend In July With $217M+: How Long Does This Box Office Boom Last As Strikes Continue? – Update","'Barbie' Ends First Week with $258M, 'Oppenheimer' $127M+: Box Office","SATURDAY LATE NIGHT UPDATE: This weekend should really be a come-to-Jesus for both AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA to get their acts together and come to terms. That’s because it’s truly a rich one at the box office, with studio estimates pegging $217.4M for all films, a record for the last weekend of July. It’s also +122% from a year ago, and +34% from pre-pandemic 2019, which was led by the second frame of The Lion King.
Overall, this weekend is off 30% from last weekend’s massive $311.2M.
And this is a holdover weekend at the box office, not some mega opening one led by a Marvel movie. Granted, the stone in many actors and actresses’ shoes are streamers with residuals. However, OTT services will be stiffed too at film festivals by the low wattage of their awards season fare if they don’t come to peace ASAP with SAG-AFTRA.
It’s a very bittersweet moment: This is the best we’ve seen the box office in post Covid-times, and exhibition is about to get smacked to the ground again, but during what is normally a very rich October, November, and December — that is, if more films start shifting. Should Legendary/Warner Bros’ Dune: Part Two move out of November, it begins to get really bleak, especially with the first weekend of October now without a potential kickstarter in Kraven the Hunter. Let’s hope nothing else pivots. That first weekend of October has been a lucrative launchpad for comic book movies like the Venom franchise and DC’s Joker. Deadline is already hearing about layoffs at exhibitors as they brace for this roller coaster ride.
Warner Bros.
Thank God for Sony’s Equalizer 3 hanging in there over Labor Day and New Line’s The Nun 2 in the post Labor Day frame to grease the wheels of autumn. We didn’t have that last year after Warners moved the Stephen King feature Salem’s Lot out of the fall (that movie has yet to be dated on the calendar). September should be safe and up over last year, August, too, before it becomes grim.
Warners was seeing $95M for Barbie this weekend as of this morning, but she looks like she’s coming in more in the $91M-$93M range at 4,337 theaters — which is still perfect and the best second weekend Warner Bros. has ever seen in their lives. Anyway it comes in; Barbie beats Dark Knight‘s weekend 2 of $75.1M.
At the high end, Barbie’s total would land at $351.4M on Sunday. She made $34M last night, per industry estimates, +17% from Friday’s $29M. Barbie crossed the $300M mark tonight in nine days, making it the fastest female-driven pic to do so stateside, beating Beauty and the Beast‘s ten days to that benchmark.
Universal’s Oppenheimer is turning in $18.1M today, +35% over Friday’s $13.1M for a $46M second weekend at 3,647 theaters, -44%, for a running total of $173.6M. That’s a great second weekend for an R-rated film, besting the second frames of such R-rated movies like Logan ($38.1M) and Deadpool 2 ($43.4M). It’s also the best second weekend for an R-rated pic this year, besting John Wick: Chapter 4 ($28.3M). It: Chapter One owns the second weekend record for an R-rated movie at $60.1M.
Disney’s Haunted Mansion is still eyeing a third place $24M opening after a $7.5M Saturday, -24% from Friday (plus previews) of $9.9M. A mixed bag here: a notable result for family counterprogramming in the wake of Barbenheimer. However, it doesn’t move the needle for the brand, as it’s so similar to the results of the 2003 version. The pic missing its $30M industry projections has less to do with the SAG-AFTRA strike and more to do Barbenheimer. The pic’s world premiere at Disneyland occurred on the second day of the strike, so no one from the cast was there. However, Disney had the cast available for a shout-out video at the Disney Parks Halfway to Halloween, in addition to Rosario Dawson as a Ghost Host at Magic Kingdom’s Haunted Mansion attraction, and a stunt where talent transformed into Disneyland Cast:
Disney built any noise for their last fling this summer off of the tried-and-true bespoke elements of a family marketing campaign, including promo partners (BMW, State Farm, Zillow), cinema partnerships (Regal New Orleans sweepstakes, AMC early access screenings and giveaways, and Cinemark Madame Leota popcorn collectible); and cross promos on cable networks, i.e.
–HGTV broadcast piece on House Haunters, complete with a Special Look and branded tune-ins.
–VH1 and Comedy Central custom broadcast piece on “Scare BnB” featuring film talent.
–Bravo’s “A Housewives Haunting” features Real Housewives conducting a seance.
–Disney Channel’s “Behind the Screams Challenge” included Raven’s Home favorites attempting to make it through the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Park.
–FX’s “What We Do in the Shadows: Haunted Mansion Edition” branded tune-ins and special Look.

Demos were 59% women, 41% men, with 18-34 repping 45% of moviegoers, and 25-34 the largest demo at 28%. Diversity demos were 48% Caucasian, 25% Latino and Hispanic, 13% Black, and 14% Asian/other. Haunted Mansion played strongest in the South and West. Some 18% of the weekend to date is being driven by PLFs, with the AMC Disney Springs the top-grossing theater in the nation with $76K (plus early shows) through Friday.

A24’s Talk to Me is not to be ignored, bringing depth to the marketplace with a Saturday of $3.7M, a 10% dip from its $4.1M Friday (and previews) for a $10M opening at 2,340 theaters in the No. 6 spot. That’s just $3.5M shy of Hereditary‘s start and higher than the $6.5M Friday-Sunday of Midsommar (which kicked off on a Wednesday) — both A24 genre movies. The NY-based studio snapped up the Australian horror pic for high seven figures.
B+ CinemaScore, as we previously told you. Critics love this film from filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou at 95% certified fresh. The horror movie played strongest in the South Central and West. AMC Burbank is the top theater domestic with $15.6K through Friday. Logline: When a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces.
Fourth goes to Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom at 3,411 locations with a fourth Saturday of $5.1M, up from Friday’s $4M for a $13.8M estimated weekend, -30%, for a running total of $150.3M.
Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One at 3,911 theaters saw a third Saturday of $4.3M, +48% from Friday’s $2.9M for a third weekend of $10.65M, -45%, for a running total of $139.1M. In its first 19 days, the Tom Cruise pic is pacing 7% behind Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, that pic’s current gross at end of weekend 5 at $167M. Realize Indy launched on a Friday and Mission on a Wednesday.
FRIDAY LATE NIGHT UPDATE after midday update: No major seismic changes at the box office here tonight from what we saw this afternoon as Barbie continues to roll in dream house dough with an industry estimated second weekend between $90M-$94M at 4,337 theaters, -44% on the low end, for a running total of $348M-$352M.
It’s not surprising to see a higher figure here on Barbie, given how the Mattel doll has pulled in Marvel like grosses of $20M+ daily during the weekdays. Friday is looking like $28M, -60% from a week ago. That second weekend for Barbie isn’t that far from the $90.4M weekend two of Beauty and the Beast.
Last year at this time, all films totaled $97.9M for the weekend, and off of Barbie alone it’s clear we’re going to be, gosh, possibly north of $160M-$170M. Hopefully, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP can get their acts together because this box office rally could hit some severe potholes of big pics like Dune: Part Two and Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom move out of the 2023 calendar.
Univeral’s Oppenheimer is seeing a second Friday of $13.5M,-58%, and second weekend of $46M, -44%, for a ten-day total of $173.8M at 3,647 theaters. This 3-hour period drama from the onset has always been ahead of Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, that pic posting a second weekend of $26.6M, -47%.
Disney’s Haunted Mansion is still seeing $10M for Friday and a 3-day of $25M at 3,740 theaters.
‘Talk to Me’ Altitude
There’s extra filler here for specialty chains as A24’s Australian horror movie, Talk to Me, is posting $4M (includes $1.24M Thursday previews) for Friday and around $10M for the weekend at 2,340 theaters. Both pics get a B+ CinemaScore.
For a horror film like Talk to Me, that’s solid, while Haunted Mansion’s is only an inch better than the B the Eddie Murphy 2003 movie received. Also, in terms of whether this was a successful reboot or not — likely the latter. Not that it’s not a solid number, but it’s just not that much improvement on the 2003 version with opened to $24.2M (unadjusted for inflation), which legged out to $75.8M. No doubt Barbie took air out of Haunted Mansion‘s sails. We’ll see after Saturday night if matinees push this to $30M, however, no one is seeing that at this point.
Still, nothing to complain about: Studios have product, competition is a good thing. However, the fall/holiday box office could be headed for a cliff after the first major schedule changes by Sony on Friday with Kraven the Hunter and Ghostbusters sequel moving into 2024. The respective points to make here is that it takes stars to launch franchises, and it takes stars to finish movies (i.e. looping) as the SAG-AFTRA strike drags on.
Some distribs might snark at Sony for pushing Gran Turismo to Aug. 25, however, it’s smart because they stay out of the wake of Barbenheimer, and if the movie has any kind of pulse, can buoy August into September with Equalizer 3 and The Nun 2 still hold firming.
Sony keeps the following films in the fall: their TIFF comedy title Dumb Money on Sept. 22, Journey to Bethlehem on Nov. 11, the horror film Thanksgiving on Nov. 17, Apple Original Films’ Napoleon on Nov. 22 and the Glen Powell-Sydney Sweeney romantic comedy Anyone But You on Dec. 15.
Rounding out the box office, there’s Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom in weekend 4 with a fourth estimated Friday of $4M at 3,411 theaters and 3-day of $13.3M, -33% and running total of $149.7M.
Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One booked at 3,191 theaters is seeing a third Friday of $3M, third weekend of $11.1M in fifth place, -42%, for a running total of $139.6M.
FRIDAY AM UPDATE: It’s another sexy $20M+ day for Barbie with Warner Bros reporting $21.2M on Thursday (-8% from Wednesday), ending its first week at $258.3M. The pic should easily become the fastest female demo feature to $300M, beating the 10 days that it took Beauty and the Beast to cross.
Among all Warner Bros Thursdays, Barbie is fourth after The Matrix Reloaded ($37.5M, May 15, 2003), The Hangover Part Two ($31.6M, May 26, 2011) and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ($22M, July 16, 2009).
Oppenheimer made $10M yesterday, -6% from Wednesday, for a first week of $127.8M. Again, in the face of Barbie, that’s an excellent hold. Barbie is expected to gross around $70M in weekend 2, Oppenheimer is around $35M. We are hearing both pics are looking at the best second weekend presales ever.
The Boxoffice Company, which supplies showtimes to Google, TikTok, IMDB, Bing and Apple is reporting a record-breaking sales for its network of 150 exhibition partners. Barbie and Oppenheimer are collectively generating one of the best holdover weekends ever since Avengers: Endgame. Per the leading theater chains with the Box Office Company, this past week is shaping up to be the best full week of ticket sales since Spider-Man: No Way Home‘s full holiday week of Dec. 17-23, 2021.
Haunted Mansion began previews on Wednesday with Dolby Early Access Screenings at 7 p.m. followed by national previews at 3 p.m. yesterday and made $3.1M. Presales indicated a start of $30M, but the big x-factor is whether Barbie steals family business away, even though the theme park ride movie is gaining 200 PLF screens.
Haunted Mansion’s figure compares to Jungle Cruise ($2.7M from Thursday previews, but was also day-and-date on Disney+) and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil ($2.3M, pre-pandemic).

2023-07-28 17:55:16+00:00,Haunted Mansion box office previews scare up a lackluster debut as Barbie and Oppenheimer continue to dominate cinemas,Disney's Haunted Mansion box office scares up a humdrum debut as Barbie and Oppenheimer continue to dominate cinemas.,"Whose idea was it for several of the summer’s most significant blockbusters to play in theaters simultaneously? Competition is fierce as audiences try to beat the muggy summer heat at cinemas, with films like Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Barbie, Oppenheimer, and Haunted Mansion occupying screens.
Despite the film’s aggressive PR campaign, Disney‘s Haunted Mansion only scared up $3.1M at the box office in Preview Screenings. The family-friendly comedy inspired by Disney’s world-famous theme park attraction began previews on Wednesday with Dolby Access Screenings at 7 p.m. followed by national previews at 3 p.m. yesterday, earning $3.1M. Analysts predict a $30M launch for Disney’s spooky live-action romp, but if Barbie continues to sell tickets like hotcakes, the ghosts of Phantom Manor could be in for a restless eternal slumber.
Meanwhile, people still see pink as Barbie continues to sing and dance her way to the top of the box office charts. Greta Gerwig’s meta-comedy earned $21.2M on Thursday, ending its first week with $258.3M. Barbie brings audiences from multiple demographics to the theater, with many being surprised and delighted by Gerwig’s stylish depiction of Barbie World.
Oppenheimer is also making headlines with $10M in Thursday earnings, bringing its first-week total to $127.8M. It’s an impressive hold in the face of the overwhelming power of Barbie, which could gross $70M in its second weekend.
Directed by Justin Simien (Dear White People) from a screenplay by Katie Dippold (Ghostbusters), the film has the following synopsis: In this mysterious adventure, a doctor (Dawson) and her 9-year-old son (Dillon) looking to start a new life, move into a strangely affordable mansion in New Orleans, only to discover that the place is much more than they bargained for. Desperate for help, they contact a priest (Wilson), who, in turn, enlists the aid of a widowed scientist-turned-failed-paranormal expert (Stanfield), a French Quarter psychic (Haddish), and a crotchety historian (DeVito).
Disney’s Haunted Mansion opened in 1969 after years of toil and compromise for the frightful yet funny theme park experience. The premise for the ride involves guests of the park going inside a spooky manor where they encounter ghosts, ghouls, and other members of the undead community. As you venture through the estate, the building warps and changes its appearance several times. The experience eventually ends with an unforgettable ghostly encounter that makes you think ghosts follow you back to your hotel.

2023-07-24 19:37:59+00:00,What the viral AI-generated ‘Barbenheimer’ trailer says about generative AI hype | The AI Beat,Here are three things a viral AI-generated 'Barbenheimer' trailer says about the state of generative AI right now.,"Are you ready to bring more awareness to your brand? Consider becoming a sponsor for The AI Impact Tour. Learn more about the opportunities here.
A new AI-generated movie trailer that splices together the wildly-hyped movies Barbie and Oppenheimer into a mashup — featuring a pink mushroom cloud — has gone viral.
The trailer offers a spot-on sendup on the “Barbenheimer” hype that had moviegoers flocking to see both movies back-to-back, even though the two films couldn’t be more different — Oppenheimer is a sober biopic about the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, while Barbie is a fizzy, feminist, live-action look at the famous doll.
>>Don’t miss our special issue: The Future of the data center: Handling greater and greater demands.<<
Powered by image generation AI Midjourney and movie generator Runway Gen2 and featuring AI-generated voices supposedly belonging to Margot Robbie and Matt Damon, the “Barbenheimer” crossover took just four days to make, according to the creator’s Reddit post, where he shared a link to his course on AI filmmaking.

But as a reporter covering AI’s cheerful, bullish, even fluffy side as well as its serious, sobering side, I can’t help but think about three things the AI-generated ‘Barbenheimer’ movie trailer says about the state of generative AI right now.
1. AI-generated entertainment is moving fast — perfect for today’s viral moments.
So, it’s no surprise that as the Barbenheimer hype rocketed upward, any online content-maker could jump on board with their own quick-and-dirty AI-generated take to share across social platforms. A traditional ad agency couldn’t possibly move fast enough to pull off the same kind of “Barbenheimer” sendup to meet the moment, and the costs would be prohibitive enough that they likely wouldn’t even try.
In an era when social media content is part of the zeitgeist more than ever, there’s no doubt that the speed of development of AI-generated entertainment is perfectly placed for today’s viral moments. Back in March, for example, a Reddit user shared an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread on social media as well as the mainstream press, with one article saying the video “would haunt you for the rest of your life.”
2. The ‘Barbenheimer’ trailer comes as creatives strike and regulators play AI catchup.
Hollywood has come nearly to a halt in recent weeks, with SAG-AFTRA actors and writers currently on strike and expressing particular concerns about the impact of gen AI on their industry and jobs. The “Barbenheimer” trailer is a perfect example: Who needs the pricey services of Margot Robbie and Matt Damon if you can come up with a serviceable AI copy? Why use the time-consuming work of artists or editors when you have the speedy output of Midjourney and Runway Gen 2?
At the same time, AI-focused creatives who are excited by the possibilities of gen AI are going full-steam ahead — even as regulators and policy-makers sprint to catch up. The Senate will be schooled in AI this fall with an eye towards a foundation for developing regulations in 2024. Will that be too little, too late?
3. The current generative AI hype may just be a candy-colored wrapper around a more serious, unsettling reality.
The AI-generated Barbenheimer trailer is, in my opinion, funny and adorable. But the idea that you could wrap one of history’s most horrifying periods — the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 — in a candy-colored Barbie wrapper and a pink mushroom cloud is equal parts stunning and shocking.
That’s gen AI in a nutshell — stunning and shocking, exciting and frightening, dazzling and appalling, sometimes all at once. But certainly, all stakeholders involved in AI development need to consider not just the sugary surface of what gen AI can do, but the deep, real issues that lay underneath.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2FpL3doYXQtdGhlLXZpcmFsLWFpLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItdHJhaWxlci1zYXlzLWFib3V0LWdlbmVyYXRpdmUtYWktaHlwZS10aGUtYWktYmVhdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Sublime! 'Barbie' tops $1bn globally in first for solo woman director,"Hollywood's pink wave has yet to crest as Warner Bros.' ""Barbie"" dominated for a third straight weekend in North American theaters, pushing the film's global haul past $1 billion in a first for a solo woman director, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Sunday.","The Greta Gerwig-directed blockbuster has tapped into a cultural zeitgeist: not only did it make history by hitting the billion-dollar box office milestone, it also did so faster than any film -- including those directed by men -- in Warner Bros.' 100-year history, executives there said.
The film, which earlier scored the biggest opening weekend of the year, ""has captured the imagination of moviegoers around the world and the results are incredibly impressive,"" analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore said.
Starring Margot Robbie as iconic doll Barbie and Ryan Gosling as boyfriend Ken, the movie earned a projected $53 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period, for a domestic total of $459 million and a whopping $1.03 billion worldwide.
Co-written by Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach, it follows Barbie as she contends with her woman-led, pink-plastered fantasy land becoming infected with real world problems, in a comic self-aware commentary on the dolls' decades-old cultural significance.
A supporting cast including Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera add even more star power to the film, while its soundtrack includes new songs by chart toppers Dua Lipa, Lizzo and Nicki Minaj -- as well as a surprise hit in ""I'm Just Ken,"" the power ballad sung in the film by Gosling.
""Barbie"" is only the sixth film to surpass $1 billion at the box-office since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Variety.
Falling to third place was Universal's ""Oppenheimer,"" the dark historical drama whose opening the same week as ""Barbie"" sparked the massive ""Barbenheimer"" social media trend.
- 'Oppenheimer' becomes top-grossing WWII film -
It was bumped by Warner Bros. newcomer ""Meg 2: The Trench,"" an action sequel in which Jason Statham tries to survive attacks by gargantuan prehistoric sharks.
""Meg 2"" pulled in $30 million for the weekend, while Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" earned $28.7 million to push its global total to $552 million.
That total made the story about the creation of the atomic bomb the all-time top grossing World War II film, ahead of Nolan's own ""Dunkirk"" ($527 million) and Steven Spielberg’s ""Saving Private Ryan"" ($482 million), not adjusted for inflation, according to Hollywood Reporter.
Fourth place for the weekend went to ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" the latest in the franchise about a team of reptilian heroes in a half shell. The Paramount animated comedy, featuring the voices of Jackie Chan and Post Malone, brought in $28 million.
Disney release ""Haunted Mansion"" slid two spots to fifth, with the lavishly produced kid-centric film -- starring LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish and Owen Wilson -- earning $8.9 million.
Holding its own in sixth was the independent ""Sound of Freedom,"" from Santa Fe Films and Angel Studios, at $7 million. The low-budget action thriller has sparked controversy, with critics saying its story about child sex trafficking plays into Qanon conspiracy theories.
All in all, it was an exceptional weekend for Hollywood, with the top four films all raking in $28 million or more -- though whether the industry can sustain that momentum in the face of a historic writers' and actors' strike remains to be seen.
Not only did the top films come close to doubling the total from the same weekend last year, they surpassed the corresponding pre-pandemic weekend in 2019, analysts said.
As Ken might have said -- in a line reportedly ad-libbed by Gosling in ""Barbie"" -- the weekend was ""Sublime!""
Rounding out the top 10 were:
""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1"" ($6.4 million)
""Talk to Me"" ($6.2 million)
""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" ($1.5 million)
""Elemental"" ($1.2 million)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphY2FyYW5kYWZtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc3VibGltZWJhcmJpZS10b3BzLTFibi1nbG9iYWxseS1pbi1maXJzdC1mb3Itc29sby13b21hL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-22 14:00:00+00:00,"Wait, Is Ryan Gosling Really Singing on ""I’m Just Ken""?","In the new 'Barbie' movie, Ryan Gosling's Ken belts out a song appropriately titled ""I'm Just Ken."" Is Gosling really singing the song? Here's what we know.","It's Barbie weekend, everyone, and as such, I hope you all are SPRINTING to the theater to see this cinematic masterpiece. I've seen it twice and I can say it's just as good on the second round. But as I left the theater, one question was nagging at me, and I desperately needed an answer. As you might know if you've been on the internet in the last few weeks, there's a song in the movie called ""I'm Just Ken,"" and without spoiling, it comes at a very pivotal moment. Ryan Gosling performs it in the movie, but I needed to know: is he actually singing on the track? Here's what I found out.
Not only does he sing the song, but he *asked* to sing it.
According to Vanity Fair, Mark Ronson, who worked on the music for the movie, wrote the song without knowing if Ryan would sing it himself. But when Ryan heard it, he liked it enough that he volunteered. So Mark flew to London to record Ryan on the song. And Ryan knocked it out of the park, as you can tell by listening to the song now.
“He really got [that] it had to walk this line of not being funny or parody,” he says. “But obviously, the song is also kind of ridiculous at times. So he was really amazing, and when he really did start hitting the big notes, I was like, this dude is a vocal powerhouse!”
If you need proof of that vocal prowess, just give the song another listen:
It probably shouldn't come as a surprise that Ryan can sing considering he was in a whole musical called La La Land, but hey, autotune exists! So it's fun to know he was really singing. This is now officially the song of the summer.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMvYTQ0NjExNjI0L2lzLXJ5YW4tZ29zbGluZy1zaW5naW5nLWltLWp1c3Qta2VuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

AMC Theaters this week announced that more than 20,000 members of its AMC Stubs loyalty program have purchased tickets to watch the unlikely cinematic pairing on the same day.
Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" have been slated for a July 21 release for the past year. The juxtaposition between the bright and bubbly ""Barbie"" and the dour, nuclear bomb drama has led internet users to declare ""Barbenheimer"" a must-see double feature.
Fans have created T-shirts, posters and have been following the marketing for both films closely.
""[This] is a great sign that the growing online conversation around seeing both of these incredible films is turning into ticket sales,"" AMC Theaters VP of programming Elizabeth Frank said in a statement shared with Variety.
""From Friday to today, we saw a 33% increase in the number of guests who decided to create their own double feature by purchasing tickets to see both movies on the same day,"" she added. ""We are thrilled to see this momentum.""
As recently as the end of last month, ""Barbie"" was tracking for an $80 million opening weekend, while forecasts for ""Oppenheimer"" were in the $40 million range.
With a combined runtime of 5 hours and 9 minutes, not including trailers, the ""Barbenheimer"" double feature will require fans to make a substantial time commitment.
Tom Cruise, whose ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" is releasing a week and a half before the two rival blockbusters hit cinemas, recently tweeted his support for both films.
But he won't be watching them the same day.
""I want to see both 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer,'"" Cruise said. ""I'll see them opening weekend. Friday, I'll see Oppenheimer' first and then 'Barbie' on Saturday.""

2023-06-21 13:00:00+00:00,Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla Goes Beyond the Eyeliner and Aqua Net In First Trailer,"Starring Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley and Jacob Elordi as her very famous husband, Priscilla tells the other side of one of the 20th century’s most famous love stories.","Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis may have introduced an entire new generation to the King just last year, but he didn’t really cover the eyelashes. Or, for that matter, the miniskirts, the winged eyeliner, or the Aqua Netted hair reaching to the heavens.
For all of that we now have Priscilla, the latest film from Sofia Coppola, in which Priscilla Presley (played by Cailee Spaeny) takes center stage in her love story with Elvis (played by Jacob Elordi). The film, out in October from A24, just released its first trailer, which you can watch above.
Coppola, knowing what the audience is expecting from both filmmaker and subject, starts with the signifiers: the polished toes on a 60s era shag rug, the winged eyeliner, the false eyelashes made of real hair. But you don’t need the ominous score from Phoenix (fronted by Coppola’s husband Thomas Mars) to tell you there is very much more here than meets the eye. While there are glimpses of Priscilla’s full life with Elvis, including the birth of their daughter Lisa Marie and his caped Vegas years, there’s a particular emphasis on the period in which they met. 23-year-old Elvis, already a superstar, had enlisted in the Army and was stationed in West Germany, where he met the 14-year-old daughter of an Air Force officer: Priscilla Beaulieu.
In last year’s Elvis, Priscilla’s extremely young age is somewhat glossed over in the scenes where she and Elvis meet; she’s presented more or less as his peer, or at least far less dazzled by him than the teenagers we’ve seen fainting at his concerts. But Priscilla lingers on images of her schoolgirl outfits and saddle shoes, and the only line of dialogue — “Priscilla, what about boys in school?” — only further emphasizes her youth. Having made a grand, candy-colored tragedy about one of history’s other famous child brides, Marie Antoinette, Coppola is in familiar, extremely rich territory here.
Based on Priscilla Presley‘s own memoir Elvis and Me, Priscilla centers on two young stars, both in their most high-profile roles yet. Spaeny shone as the murder victim in Mare of Easttown, while Elordi has something of a fanbase of his own already thanks to his roles on Euphoria and the Kissing Booth franchise. With a plum fall release date and an Oscar-winning writer-director, though, Priscilla will be an entirely new proving ground for both of them.

The ""Barbie"" campaign follows Roku's recent partnership with Shopify that allows viewers to purchase products from Shopify merchants directly from their TV through Roku Action ads — another effort to attract marketers to the platform.
Dive Insight:
Roku is the latest company to catch ""Barbie"" fever in the run-up to the film's release on July 21. The platform's immersive campaign looks to tap into viewer excitement for the film, which saw searches during the week of June 25 spike four-times higher than average query volumes over the preceding four weeks, per Roku's blog post.
The full-funnel campaign includes a ""Barbie""-themed placement on Roku's home screen on July 20 that puts the movie in front of Roku's more than 70 million active account holders when they power up their devices. The movie will also take over the Roku City screensaver — which 85% of users have watched scroll by — with imagery including Barbie's Dream house and a ""Barbie""-branded movie theater. Finally, clicking a ""Barbie"" banner will allow viewers to see a trailer and scan a QR code to buy movie tickets.
The campaign comes days after Roku on July 11 announced a partnership that allows viewers to purchase directly from Shopify merchants through Roku Action Ads. After seeing an ad for a Shopify merchant, viewers can press ""OK"" to learn more about the product, purchase it directly and checkout using Roku Pay. The seamless integration allows Shopify Merchants to turn ad impressions into direct sales, improving the ads' efficacy.
The ""Barbie"" campaign and Shopify checkout integration are among Roku's latest efforts to try to connect the streaming platform more directly with retailers and advertisers. Roku this year partnered with DoorDash and Walmart around interactive shoppable ads and with Best Buy around retail media and first-party data optimization.
The company continues to look for monetization opportunities that can accelerate revenue growth until the ad market fully recovers, according to the company's letter to shareholders around Q1 2023 earnings. Roku reported 1% revenue growth in the quarter, beating investor expectations, but expects macro uncertainties to persist throughout the year and continue to drag on ad sales.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldGluZ2RpdmUuY29tL25ld3Mvcm9rdS1iYXJiaWUtY2FtcGFpZ24tc2hvcGlmeS1jaGVja291dC82ODc1MTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,What Christians can learn from 'Barbie' movie hype,The trailer brought fans to the theater; believers are human trailers for the kingdom,"Bill Tinsley
Abilene Reporter-News
Anyone who has not heard about Barbie must live on the moon.
We have been inundated with trailers and clips and commercials ""Barbie,"" the first live-action film about the iconic doll starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken.
Barbie “launched her career” in March 1959 at the American International Toy Fair in New York. Ken was introduced two years later. After years of production, the movie was released last week and grossed $382 million at the box office. Many years ago, the movie industry discovered the power of trailers, short clips and promotional scenes that entice us to spend money to watch their movies.
Perhaps we can learn something from Barbie.
The Australian writer, Michael Frost, argues that Christians and churches are like movie trailers for the kingdom. We are to live in such a way that when others see us, they say, “I want to be a part of that,” or ”I wish the world was like that.” This is what Jesus meant when he said, “Let your light so shine that men may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”Whether we like it or not, our churches and our lives are being viewed as movie trailers by others. When non-believers look at our churches and our lives, they are whispering to themselves and to one another saying, “I’ll have to check that out,” or, “I wouldn’t want to be part of that.”Jesus presented the clearest preview of the kingdom. He invited others to look at his life to see what the Kingdom looks like. He said, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” (Luke 4:18-21).
The early followers of Jesus practiced kingdom living in such a way that others were drawn to them and to their churches. This is why the Christian faith exploded in the first three centuries. People saw previews of the Kingdom practiced in the churches and the lives of believers, and they wanted to be part of it. Across the centuries the Christian faith has been the primary source for charities that care for the poor and dispossessed.This is also the reason Christianity is stumbling in our day. Too often, churches and Christians are selfish and self-centered, fighting among themselves for control with a judgmental attitude toward others. When others see this, like patrons at a theater, they whisper to themselves, “That’s not for me.”Every church and every believer must live in such a way that others see God’s Kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. This is what the Apostle Paul meant when he said, “But thanks be to God, who … manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place. For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.” (2 Cor. 2:14-15).

Learn how to find the official Ken sweatshirt from the movie online, as well as a similar alternative.","Barbie is, without a doubt, the biggest movie this summer. Greta Gerwig's film about Mattel's famous doll and her existential crisis has fans running to the theater (some before or after they watch Oppenheimer). Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the movie (without spoiling too much) is an exploration of the doll's impact on the world, and how Barbie fits into contemporary society.
And the film's success is due in no small part to the various brand collaborations and marketing done leading up to the film's release. Makeup brands, video game companies, and more have joined in on the excitement around Barbie. And even now that the film is out, the merch tie-ins are still going.
The ""I am Kenough"" hoodie is featured in the film, and it's incredible. Why is it such an iconic piece of clothing, you might ask? Well, without giving too much away, it's part of a pivotal moment toward the end of the film. And, of course, Ryan Gosling looks great in it. It only makes sense everyone would want to wear a version of it too.

But due to its popularity, it may be hard for you to snag the real thing. So, we've got the place you can get the original, while also showing you a fashionable alternative in case you miss out on the initial frenzy. Regardless, you'll look great, and everyone will know you're ""Kenough"". Here's where to snag that hoodie.

Where Can You Buy the ""I am Kenough"" Hoodie?

Mattel currently has a preorders available for the ""I am Kenough"" hoodie, and plans to ship them on or before September 29. It costs $60. That may be a while away, but that doesn't mean you should wait to purchase. As more moviegoers head out to see Barbie, it's likely demand will only increase.

Is There An ""I am Kenough"" Hoodie Alternative?

If the Mattel version sells out or is put on backorder, there's another legitimate option. Walmart is currently selling a ""I am Kenough"" hoodie as well. The difference is in the texture of the clothing. Mattel's hoodie has a fuzzy exterior, while Walmart's is more of a standard hoodie look. But if you're not willing to put down $60 for the top, Walmart is selling their hoodie for $25, and you can get it right away. No wait.

The historical epic charts the rise to power of the French emperor, as he plots his way to the top amid the chaos engulfing his country.

Entwined with that is his volatile relationship with Joséphine, who we see flirting and having a secret fumble with him, and being told that he is nothing without her.

The focus of the trailer is the awe-inspiring action, especially the battle on the snowy fields. The film's official synopsis hypes up how the big fights were filmed practically, which is nothing less than we'd expect from legendary director Ridley Scott.

The synopsis in full reads: ""Napoleon is a spectacle-filled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, played by Oscar-winner Joaquin Phoenix.

KEVIN BAKER // Apple

""Against a stunning backdrop of large-scale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director Ridley Scott, the film captures Bonaparte's relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his one true love, Joséphine, showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed.""

The last time Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix collaborated was on the classic film Gladiator all the way back in 2000, so hopes are high for this one.

The film is a reunion for the director and David Scarpa, who wrote the script for Scott's 2017 film All the Money in the World and is working with him on Gladiator 2.

2023-07-12 19:33:37+00:00,Timothée Chalamet Nearly Played Ken in the 'Barbie' Movie - Inside the Magic,It looks like 'Barbie' movie director Greta Gerwig is finally opening up about the actors that were nearly cast.,"Greta Gerwig is opening up about Barbie casting that could have been.

The Barbie movie has a somewhat dramatic past. The journey of the live-action Barbie film began in September 2009 when Universal Pictures initially announced the project, with Laurence Mark set to produce. However, it wasn’t until April 2014 that development truly commenced, as Sony Pictures acquired the film rights to the iconic character. Over the course of the film’s evolution, there were several changes in writers and directors, and the casting went through transitions as well, with Amy Schumer initially attached and later replaced by Anne Hathaway in the lead role. In October 2018, Sony lost the rights, which were subsequently transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2019, Margot Robbie was cast as Barbie. Finally, in 2021, Greta Gerwig was announced as the director and co-writer of the film, alongside Noah Baumbach.

Journey into the Barbie world in the movie trailer, available on official social media:

Now, directed by Gerwig and co-written with Baumbach, the new Barbie movie has been reworked into a fantasy comedy film set to release in theaters 20 July, 2023 — interestingly, the same day as Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, starring massive Hollywood names like Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt. Drawing inspiration from Mattel’s popular Barbie doll line, this live-action adaptation marks a departure from previous computer-animated direct-to-video and streaming television films also utilizing the Barbie brand. Think: Barbie in the Nutcracker (2001), or Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper (2004). This much-anticipated movie follows the adventures of Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who embark on a quest to find themselves after leaving the idyllic Barbie Land.

The (current) Barbie movie cast

The star-studded cast of the Barbie film also includes America Ferrera, who portrays Gloria, a Mattel employee who discovers Barbie in the real world. Kate McKinnon takes on the role of Weird Barbie, while Issa Rae shines as President Barbie. Rhea Perlman embodies Ruth Handler, and Will Ferrell portrays the CEO of Mattel. The film also features various interpretations of Barbie, with Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Alexandra Shipp as Writer Barbie, Emma Mackey as Physicist Barbie, Sharon Rooney as Lawyer Barbie, Dua Lipa as Mermaid Barbie, Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, and Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie.

The different versions of Ken are played by Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, Scott Evans, and Ncuti Gatwa, while John Cena brings Merman Ken to life. Additionally, Helen Mirren serves as the narrator, Emerald Fennell takes on the role of Midge, and Michael Cera plays Allan. Together, this ensemble cast brings the beloved Barbie characters to the big screen in a highly anticipated film.

Director Greta Gerwig’s casting disappointments

It seems like Greta Gerwig is finally opening up about the casting process of the Barbie movie — and she’s recounting two very particular moments in which she was definitely “annoyed”.

Speaking to CinemaBlend, Gerwig shares how she nearly got two Little Women (2019) alumni to join her explosively pink Barbie film. Firstly, she talks about how Saoirse Ronan, who played Jo March in Little Women nearly had a “specialty cameo” in the film — but due to the fact that she was “actually producing at the time”, her cameo was originally going to be “a sort of smaller thing”.

She also mentions Timothée Chalamet and how he nearly had a cameo role as well, affectionately calling him “Timmy”. Gerwig however, also makes it clear how she “was so annoyed” at the fact that “both of them couldn’t do it”. Despite her disappointment in the loss of these roles, it seems Gerwig still is happy to call herself “their mom”:

But I love them so much. But it felt like doing something without my children. I mean, I’m not their mom, but I sort of feel like their mom.

Either way, it doesn’t seem like any bridges were actually burned! It’s almost certain that the Dune (2022) actor would have played a Ken in the Barbie film — as part of the endearingly creepy collective of singing and dancing Ken dolls of which Ryan Gosling’s Ken and Simu Liu’s Ken (yes, Marvel’s superhero Shang-Chi) belong. For now, audiences have the Roald Dahl “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” live-action adaptation Wonka (2023) to catch, if they want to catch Chalamet in action again.

2023-07-21 15:07:00+00:00,Who Is Ruth Handler? What to Know About the Original Barbie Creator,"This summer's 'Barbie' was created by Greta Gerwig, but Ruth Handler is the woman who started it all.","It’s Barbie’s world, people, and we’re just living in it. Or, wait—maybe it’s the other way around? This summer’s much-anticipated feature, Barbie, explores what might happen if the real world collided with Barbie Land, resulting in an action-packed, bubblegum-pink adventure.

The film, which was directed by Greta Gerwig, is in theaters now. It follows Barbie and Ken’s journey to the real world—but, along the way, the film peppers in some fascinating history about both dolls. We won’t spoil too much, but there’s even a reference to Barbie’s original creator, Ruth Hader. Keep reading to learn more about Hader, the talented designer who brought Barbie to life.

Who is Ruth Handler?

Ruth Handler is the creator of Barbie and the first president of Mattel Toys, which she co-founded with her husband, Elliot Handler. The couple started the company in 1949—and released the first Barbie doll in 1959.

According to PBS, Handler was the daughter of Polish-Jewish immigrants. She and her husband, Elliot, were high school sweethearts who later had two children together, named Barbara and Kenneth. Their children later became the inspiration for the iconic Barbie and Ken dolls.

How did Ruth Handler Create Barbie?

Handler came up with the idea after watching her daughter and her friends play with paper dolls. In Handler’s memoir, Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story, she describes the pivotal moment. “I discovered something very important. They were using these dolls to project their dreams of their own futures as adult women,” she said. “Wouldn’t it be great if we could take that play pattern and three-dimensionalize it?”

Handler thought that creating a life-like doll would be helpful for children, but her idea was initially shut down. She pitched the concept to her husband and their Mattel business partner—Harold “Matt” Matterson (Get it? Matt and El!)—but both men thought it was impractical. In Dream Doll, she recalls them saying, “Ruth, it won’t work.” The men claimed their skepticism was strictly business, but Handler had a hunch that they were concerned about Barbie’s figure.

A few years later, Handler and her family went to Switzerland for a vacation. During their trip, she spotted a doll that jolted her memory. In Dream Doll, she remembers thinking, “Here were the breasts, the small waist, the long, tapered legs I had enthusiastically described for the designers all those years ago.” Handler purchased the toy and brought it back to America, then presented it to her team. Soon after, the first Barbie prototype was made.

The first Barbie doll was well received and is credited as the first mass-produced toy in America. In its first year on the market, 300,000 Barbies were sold for $3 each.

When Did Ruth Handler Create Ken?

Ken was added to the Barbie universe in 1961. He is named after Handler’s son, Kenneth, and was marketed as Barbie’s boyfriend. Ken is, of course, much more than Barbie's arm candy—but you'll have to see Barbie to understand why.

How Long Did Ruth Handler work at Mattel?

Handler served as the president of Mattel from 1945 to 1975. Over her 30-year run, she was instrumental in designing Barbies and turning the company into the cultural phenomenon that it is today.

2023-08-13 22:40:56+00:00,"AI Creates 'Barbenheimer' Trailer, Fans Demand Movie Next - Inside the Magic","Filmmakers created a viral sensation after using AI to design a live-action 'Barbenheimer' trailer, now fans are demanding more AI projects.","The “Barbenheimer'”phenomenon resulted from a pop culture conundrum. There were two highly-anticipated blockbusters being released the same weekend with two celebrated directors. These movies were complete opposites as far as premise, visual style and tone. The choice became too much for many movie-lovers to bare until a viral push to double-feature both films was born.

This trend exploded as Barbie would go onto gross over $1 billion and Oppenheimer would rake in $600 million. The social anomaly also created a fashion craze that encouraged audience members to dress in pink or 1940s attire. Sometimes there was a mash-up of both looks. This cinematic sensation had blown up to the point where indie filmmakers decided to use AI to reimagine Barbenheimer as an actual movie.

Curious Refuge is a company that blended dialogue from Barbie and Oppenheimer to create a blueprint for the trailer. Then, they used a movie generator AI called Runway Gen2 and an image generator known as AI Midjourney to design the trailer’s creation. The project took four days to render. While the dialogue is the most robotic aspect of the movie trailer, its merger of both movie’s iconographies was captivating for many viewers. Here is the final result:

These AI systems masterfully and hilariously combined imagery from these two movies. The most striking aspect was the 1940s styled pink clothes, as well as the massive pink nuclear explosion. Next, Ken stole the show again with scenes depicting him glowing after consuming weaponized uranium, then later responding to Oppenheimer’s somber “destroyer of worlds” quote with it being “so awesome.”

“Barbenheimer” assembled such an unexpectedly epic, fan-driven viral marketing campaign, that it not only benefited the consumers and the studios, but inspired content creators to craft even more eye-catching achievements. The Barbenheimer trailer alone has been viewed nearly 350,000 times and continues to grow. Many cinematic classics have warned humanity about the evolution of AI, such as The Terminator, Avengers: Age of Ultron, I, Robot, The Matrix and WALL-E.

However, AI’s growing development in modern society is becoming more commonplace. So much that it allows for a genuine contemplation of how it should be used, especially for entertainment. Some speculate that AI is capable of revolutionizing cinema and saving companies, like Disney, through innovation, sustainability, and adaptability. Time will tell if it will be utilized this proficiently in the entertainment industry. Until then, AI will continue to be an incendiary topic that will delight many and equally terrify others.

What do you think of the trailer? Should an entire Barbenheimer movie be made next?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDgvYWktY3JlYXRlcy1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItdHJhaWxlci1mYW5zLWRlbWFuZC1tb3ZpZS1uZXh0LWp0YzEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,How Much Does Barbie's Dream Closet Cost?,InStyle tapped a fashion expert to estimate the cost of Margot Robbie's Barbie outfits from the 'Barbie' movie trailer. See how much a movie trailer's worth of Barbie outfits costs in this totally scientific Barbie outfit investigation.,"Part of the allure of this summer's Barbie mania is the fantasy of it all. Not only did Margot Robbie serve high-fashion Mattel realness — Barbie cosplay, but make it fashion — on Barbie premiere pink carpets, but mountains of Barbiecore merch are painting the town molten pink and Malibu blue. Even so, fantasy wouldn't be fun without some good old-fashion reality to butt up against and the blurred lines between Barbie's bubblegum-pink fantasy world and real life. So, it got us thinking — what would it really cost to shop Barbie's dream closet?

Armed only with the official Barbie movie trailer and expert insights from Noelle Sciacca, Senior Lead of Women's Fashion at the RealReal, we were able to estimate how much Barbie would have to budget IRL if she were paying for her clothes, shoes, and jewelry herself. For each of the eight 'fits spotted in the Barbie trailer, Sciacca sourced similar designer pieces, many of them pre-owned, to gauge the total price per look. The final tally? Well, it's a doozy. Let's just say, you'd need to be a majorly successful business Barbie to afford these 'fits. Read on to see the price tags on eight of the looks Robbie as Barbie wore in the Barbie movie trailer.



The O.G. Barbie

Warner Bros.

The doll that started it all. Our first glimpse of Robbie as the world's most famous doll featured the original Barbie's now-iconic black-and-white swimsuit. To determine the cost of this 'fit, rather than sticking to swim, Sciacca based her estimation on the slightly tweaked version Robbie's genius stylist Andrew Mukamal cooked up for her on the Barbie press tour.



""Andrew, [Robbie's] stylist for her press tour put her in an Hervé Léger piece to mimic this look so I felt this was a perfect find,"" Sciacc says of the sold-out $130 Hervé Léger minidress she used to appraise this look. (A similar Marni knit minidress is still available for $292.) Sciacc found a near-match for Robbie-as-Barbie's exaggerated cat-eye sunnies for $400, and a similar pair of Amina Muaddi high-heeled sandals priced at $718. Toss in a pair of 14-carat gold hoop earrings ($525) and you've got yourself vintage Barbie vibes.

Total Estimated Cost: ~$1,800



Cruisin' Convertible Barbie

Warner Bros.

Bye-bye, Barbieland! For this getaway look, Sciacca sourced an Acler dress that ""perfectly mimics the cute Peter Pan collar and puff sleeve,"" for $220, a CA4LA beret ($116), a pair of pearl drop earrings ($745) in Barbie's light-pink colorway. For Barbie's unseen shoes, a pair of Miu Miu Mary Jane Slingbacks ($1,150) fit with the 'fit and the task at hand because nobody, not even Barbie, is driving a vintage car in stilettos.

Total Estimated Cost: $2,231



Western Barbie

Warner Bros.

For Barbie's cowgirl ensemble, Sciacca settled on a Christian Dior vintage vest ($103), a Burberry scarf ($100), a traditional Stetson cowboy hat ($125), and a pair of hot pink Alexandre Vauthier boots ($468), but when it came to Barbie's bottoms, she was torn. ""I found a cool Alexander McQueen pair ($594) that has that silhouette, but then I found a hot pink Safiyaa pair ($267) which really felt like the ones she's wearing in the still,"" she shares. Splitting the pants down the middle, this is one of Barbie's most affordable 'fits.

Total Estimated Cost: $1,227



Barbie Dreamhouse Barbie

Warner Bros.

Barbie's pink and white gingham dress is, according to Sciacca, one of the pieces with a more affordable price point. A similar dress from Reformation, pink bow included, costs $125. She paired the dress with a Viktoria Hayman ($102) necklace with a similar statement-piece vibe.

Warner Bros.

To match Barbie's pink pumps, Sciacca went with a pair of Balenciaga heels ($806). Naturally, a pink hair bow ($148), courtesy of Jennifer Behr was also required.

Total Estimated Cost: $1,181.

Dance Party Barbie

Warner Bros.

Surprisingly, one of Barbie's flashiest looks is potentially the most affordable. According to Sciacca, the sequin patterns on Barbie's strapless silver mini hint at a less expensive price tag than you might expect. ""It's definitely more of an '80s and '90s approach to applying sequins,"" she says, adding that she dug deep into the RealReal's fashion archives to find a similar dress. Eventually, she ""found a Badgley Mischka dress that was very spot-on and so Barbie for only $39 on sale."" Sciacca also sourced a pair of silver Louis Vuitton heels ($395). So far, so affordable, but once jewelry gets involved, the cost skyrockets.

For Barbie's bangles, Sciacca found two bracelets: a statement cuff in mixed metal ($11,995) and an abstract diamond bracelet ($8,495). ""Look,"" Sciacca says of the outfit's final total. ""I think Barbie's tapping out her budget a little bit. You could buy a car with this.""

Total Estimated Cost: $20,924



Malibu Blue Barbie

Warner Bros.

Sciacca had to do a bit of guesswork for the bottom half of this dreamy blue look, but settled on a blue Balmain top ($665) and skirt ($436) set ""in that very similar blue and white marls print."" A pair of white Jacquemus pumps ($264) make ""the perfect Barbie shoes."" Sciacca found comparable blue statement bracelets from Bottega Veneta ($212) and Louis Vuitton ($650), and a blue patterned silk scarf ($300) finishes off the look.

Total Estimated Cost: $2,096



Undercover Sleepover Barbie

Warner Bros.

Is she hosting a slumber party or posing as a member of the world's chicest custodial staff to infiltrate a high-security building? We really can't be sure, but regardless of the occasion, this look is luxe. To start the look, Sciacca found near replicas in the form of Jacquemus pants ($455), a Balenciaga button-down shirt ($189), hot pink Celine sunglasses ($375), an Emilio Pucci scarf ($116), and floral diamond earrings ($4,095). When it came to footwear, Sciacca found a pair of Roger Vivier shoes ($636) that fit the aesthetic and the possibly secret mission.

While Sciacca acknowledges this look's final total is a wild amount of money to spend on a slumber party outfit, she also points out that ""Barbie has a color, she has an aesthetic, she can mix and match these pieces with other things. They're going to work hard for her in her wardrobe.""

Total Estimated Cost: $5,866

2023-06-22 17:24:25+00:00,"Margot Robbie Thought ""They"" Would Never Let Her Make 'Barbie' - Inside the Magic",What was it about Greta Gerwig's Barbie script that made Margot Robbie think that it could never be produced? And why was she wrong?,"Margot Robbie has been saying since the beginning of her Barbie press circuit that, when she first read Greta Gerwig’s script, she thought with equal parts rabid joy and resigned disappointment: “They’re never gonna let us make this movie.”

Thankfully for all of us, she was wrong – Greta Gerwig’s Barbie did, in fact, get made, and it’s poised to be one of the biggest movies of the summer, and probably the year.

So what was it about Barbie that made Margot Robbie think it would never make it past the table reads?

Margot Robby Says Mattel Was Shockingly Cool With Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ Script

Robbie finally revealed in an interview with Fandango that it wasn’t even Warner Bros. she was worried about – it was Mattel.

The producer did not think that the toy company would allow them the space to have the free-ranging conversation necessary when “acknowledging, like, this long 60+ year history, including both the things that people love about Barbie, and the things that they hate – all while “having a relevant conversation about where the world is at today.”

The reason I didn’t think they’d let us make it, honestly, is that the Mattel CEO is a main character – Mattel itself is a character, and I just thought “they’re never gonna agree to this.” There were a lot of jokes in there where I was like “they’re not gonna let us get away with that – but they did!”

Clips from the film have shown Mattel – along with Mattel CEO Will Ferrell – as a villainous force in the story, at least in the scenes where Barbie appears to be bolting through their offices trying to escape. Allowing themselves to be seen as any sort of jailer or corporate overlord is an unexpected move on Mattel’s part, but necessary to address a toy with a history longer than any of their careers.

Mattel seems willing to acknowledge that Barbie is more than a toy, or even their Intellectual Property; she is an American – and global – icon. She’s such an ever-present force in the US that even if you didn’t have strong feelings about Barbie growing up, you had strong feelings about NOT having strong feelings.

America Fererra, who plays non-Barbie, Real World character Gloria – likely a Mattel employee – was one of those kids who didn’t have a Barbie attachment growing up, because, as she explained it was a world she didn’t feel she belonged in.

However, despite this, she seemed to feel just as seen by the film as the cast members who could recall their Barbie adventures with perfect clarity – which speaks to Robbie’s claims that the Barbie movie addresses everyone who was ever affected by the franchise.

“They take Barbie and they address both the positives and the not-so-positives about what she’s meant in culture – how she started as a revolution, but as time went on, not so much – like, how do we bring Barbie into the 21st century…how do we make that relevant to girls today, who did not grow up seeing themselves represented in that story?”

Fererra seems to be implying that one of the specific issues the Barbie movie will address is the perception that it’s only for girls who look like the classic depiction of Barbie – blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girls with perfect figures and perky personalities.

We’ve already seen a little of this in the previous trailers – BarbieLand is populated by all kinds of Barbies who have all kinds of jobs and many different personalities, from President Barbie Issa Rae to Weird Barbie Kate McKinnon. The movie will no doubt explore where the gap was created between these two perceptions – and how that gap affected the persona shaped for Barbie by the public.

What Margot Robbie seemed to truly find brilliant about the script that Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach created for Barbie is that it’s saying all of those things, not just about a doll, but about us ourselves as well. As she so succinctly summarized:

The whole experience is still fun…and weirdly emotional, and at the end of it all you’re not even really thinking about a doll, you’re thinking about what it means to be alive in the world.

Barbie will come alive in our world on July 21. Advanced screenings of the Barbie movie are also being offered in select cities – you can go to Fandango to see if tickets are still available near you.

Australian actor and producer Margot Robbie has recalled the time she paid off her mum’s mortgage, after she’d made enough money from acting.

The Barbie star told CBS Sunday Morning that her mum Sarie Kessler supported her when she first began her acting career.

“Everything I owed my mum, I had it written down. She’d take money out of the, like, house mortgage [to] lend me money. So I always knew, I was like, ‘I gotta pay that back,’” she said. “And then one day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely.”

Robbie, who starred in Australian soap opera Neighbours at the start of her career, recalled the moment she told her mum she no longer had to worry about her mortgage.

“I was like, ‘Mum, don’t even worry about that mortgage anymore. It doesn’t even exist anymore,’” she said.

“Honestly, anyone in my position, you’d do that for your mum. Of course you would,” she added.

Robbie, who has twice been nominated for Oscars and currently stars in the mega-blockbuster Barbie, said she feels grateful and lucky with where her career has taken her.

“I know I’m hardworking and blah, blah, blah, but I’m also the luckiest, luckiest, luckiest person in the world,” she said.

Robbie’s mother Sarie Kessler has spoken publicly about her pride for her daughter. In an interview with Vogue Australia in 2019, Kessler revealed Robbie told her she wanted to be an actress when she was young and never strayed from that path.

Kessler said she was “stunned” when Robbie announced her acting aspirations.

“Do you remember doing that movie? You loved it so much and you came home and said: ‘Mum, you’re not going to like this, but I’ve decided I’m going to be an actor,’” she said in the 2019 joint interview.

“And Margot, my jaw hit the floor because you were at a really good school. You come from a family with a medical background and a family with a business background, and you told me you were going to be an actor. I was stunned.”

The proud mum said she worried it would be “hard to be an actor and make a good living.”

""Yeah, I'm confused about that,"" replies Allan. Chin up, Allan! There may be only one of you in Barbieland, but in this perfect pink world of Barbies and Kens, maybe that individuality isn't such a bad thing.

2023-07-11 14:16:47.920795+00:00,Barbie: Is the movie really kids' stuff? Looking at the movie's age rating,Is Barbie really kids stuff? Popverse looks at the movie rating for the upcoming feature in both the UK and the US.,"The prime demographic for Barbie dolls are girls aged between 3 and 12 years old, according to market research across the years. Can the same be said for Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s upcoming movie based on the iconic Mattel toy line? It depends where you live in the world.

What rating is the Barbie movie in the US?

As revealed a month before the movie’s release, Barbie is rated PG-13 in the United States, with the reason for the rating being “suggestive references and brief language.” (Anyone who’s seen the movie’s trailer where Ken argues with Ken about who’s going to beach who off can at least understand that the movie might make a suggestive reference or two.)

Officially, according to the MPAA guidelines, a movie rated PG-13 means that parents are “strongly cautioned” about the feature in question, specifically that “some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.” That doesn’t mean that kids younger than 13 can’t see the movie, officially — simply that the MPAA is concerned that, if they did, they might be exposed to inappropriate content as a result.

What rating is the Barbie movie in the UK?

In the UK, kids apparently grow up a little faster — but just a little. In the United Kingdom, Barbie has received a 12A rating, with the movie dinged for “moderate innuendo, brief sexual harassment, [and] implied strong language.” (There’s that beach off again.)

The British Board of Film Classification, which is responsible for movie ratings un the UK, defines the 12A rating as “contain[ing] material that is not generally suitable for children under 12. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult.” The official definition adds, “Adults planning to take a child under 12 to view a 12A film should consider whether the film is suitable for that child.”

In both countries, then, the Barbie movie is almost outside of the core audience for the Barbie dolls — well, unless there’s a particularly lax parent willing to take them to the theater, and potentially expose them to new ideas as a result.

Barbie opens in theaters July 21. Buy tickets on Fandango or Atom Tickets.

Maybe it’s the unexpected political controversy provoked by Barbie that’s making movie censors nervous about the film.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBvcHZlcnNlLmNvbS9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtcmF0aW5nLWFnZS1yYW5nZS1nLXBnLTEzLXItcmF0ZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

In Greta Gerwig’s record-breaking film, everyone is Barbie or just Ken - with countless famous faces taking on the roles and personalities of the iconic toys.

But it turns out not everyone in Hollywood jumped at the chance. Now Barbie’s casting director has revealed which high-profile stars turned down the chance to play one of the many Kens in the movie.

Ryan Gosling appears as the main Ken to Margot Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie, with Ncuti Gatwa, Simu Liu and Kingsley Ben-Adir appearing as other versions of Ken.

Now casting director Allison Jones has revealed that Schitt’s Creek star Dan Levy, Ben Platt of Dear Evan Hansen fame, and even SNL comedian were asked to play Kens too.

She told Vanity Fair, “They were, I’m not kidding, really bummed they couldn’t do it”, mostly due to conflicting filming schedules.

Jones revealed that Glee’s Jonathan Groff was originally asked to play Ken’s limited-edition pal Allan - who was played by Michael Cera in the end.

“Dear, dear Jonathan Groff was like, ‘I can’t believe I’m typing this, but I can’t do Allan,’” Jones shared.

They aren’t the only big names to pass on the biggest film of 2023 - Amy Schumer was the first star tapped to play the leading role when it was being developed at Sony back in 2016.

But a few months later, Schumer left the project due to “scheduling conflicts”, later revealing her real reason for leaving was down to creative differences.

She told the Hollywood Reporter last year, “They definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it.”

Anne Hathaway was announced as her replacement, but was also forced to quit the film when its release date was pushed.

Robbie acknowledged earlier this year that she wasn’t the first choice to play Barbie, only stepping in after others turned down the role.

The Aussie star was already part of the project before she was cast, as her production company LuckyChap Entertainment was collaborating with Mattel Films and Heyday Films on it.

She told Vogue, “This is going to sound stupid, but I really didn’t even think about playing Barbie until years into developing the project.”

Robbie had Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, in mind for Barbie.

“Gal Gadot is Barbie energy. Because Gal Gadot is so impossibly beautiful, but you don’t hate her for being that beautiful, because she’s so genuinely sincere, and she’s so enthusiastically kind that it’s almost dorky,” she said.

“It’s like right before being a dork.”

However, Gadot was unavailable - so Robbie herself took the plunge and stepped into Barbie’s iconic shoes.

The film is already a resounding success and has broken box office records, grossing $3.5 million in New Zealand during its opening weekend, according to Universal Studios.

Oppenheimer came in second with an estimated $1.4 million - with both movies making up the biggest opening weekend for any studio in New Zealand since 2021.

,Watch trailer for new season of Project Greenlight from Issa Rae,"'Project Greenlight' returns with a spotlight on female directors. See trailers for the upcoming Max series, which features Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani as mentors, and winner Meko Winbush's movie.","Lights, camera, activism!

Project Greenlight, the reality series where up-and-coming directors compete for a chance to direct a feature film, is back. The original series, which ran on HBO and Bravo from 2001-2005, with a brief comeback in 2015, was produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Now, Issa Rae and her production company HOORAE are at the helm.

The new season, which streams on Max on July 13, will highlight all female directors for the first time. Rae, Kumail Nanjiani, and Gina Prince-Bythewood serve as mentors throughout the season, which will give an inside look at how a movie is made from the first day to the last.

The film in question? A Max original called Gray Matter, which streams the same day as Project Greenlight. Meko Winbush, who — spoiler alert! — wins this season, made her directing debut with the sci-fi thriller. The script was penned by Phil Gelatt. Gray Matter centers on a superhuman mother-daughter duo named Ayla and Aurora. Ayla attempts to show her daughter how to control her abilities, but when tragedy strikes, her past comes back to haunt her.

""I have an overwhelming sense of gratitude,"" Winbush tells EW exclusively. ""I was fortunate to have the team I had around me — it was a dream cast and crew, all of whom understood the assignment and gave 110 percent in bringing the story to life. Having Issa Rae, Gina Prince-Bythewood, and Kumail Nanjiani in my corner as my mentors was priceless. I never actually expected that I would win Project Greenlight and so now I hope that I can serve as a source of inspiration for other young filmmakers.""

,PSA: THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER Trailer Can Be Seen Before OPPENHEIMER,See it theatrically before its inevitable arrival online!,"Yesterday brought us the release of three new posters for David Gordon Green's The Exorcist: Believer, the first of three new Exorcist movies from the creative team behind the recent Halloween trilogy. Those posters didn't tell us much, but their arrival did imply that the film's first trailer would not be far behind...

...and, wouldn't ya know it, it turns out it's already here: according to the good folks over at Bloody Disgusting, the first trailer for David Gordon Green's The Exorcist: Believer is currently attached to screenings of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. All things considered (and setting aside the fact that both films are Universal productions), this probably makes more sense than attaching The Exorcist: Believer's trailer to Barbie.

As we noted yesterday: The Exorcist: Believer finds Leslie Odom Jr. playing the father of a possessed little girl. In a desperate bid to rid her of the demon that's taken over her body, he seeks out Ellen Burstyn's character ... who just might be able to offer some guidance on what to do when your kid gets hijacked by evil spirits. Complicating matters? The fact that Odom Jr.'s daughter isn't the only possessed little girl on the block.

In addition to Burstyn and Odom Jr., The Exorcist: Believer also stars Hereditary's Ann Dowd, Nightbooks' Lidya Jewett, Raphael Sbarge, Olivia Marcum, and Jennifer Nettles (who some of you might recognize from The Righteous Gemstones). They'll all be working from a script co-written by Green and Peter Sattler, from an original story written by Green, Scott Teems, and the great Danny McBride.

Nothing further to report on The Exorcist: Believer at this time. If you can't make it to a screening of Oppenheimer this weekend, don't worry - we imagine the trailer will be along sooner rather than later. Stay tuned for that, as well as any other further updates on Green's latest horror redux, as they become available.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbmdvcmlhLmNvbS9vcmlnaW5hbC90aGUtZXhvcmNpc3QtYmVsaWV2ZXItdHJhaWxlci1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Barbie’ and ‘Ken’ Baby Name Searches Are Way Up Thanks to BARBIE,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie has led to a sharp rise in expecting parents searching ""Barbie"" and ""Ken"" as possible baby names.","Game of Thrones might have ended in 2019, but its influence will live on for a lot longer. We don’t just mean in the world of pop culture, either. We mean it will literally live on thanks to all the children named after people from Westeros. That includes babies whose parents dubbed them either “Daenerys” or “Khaleesi” before the final season, when their namesake turned out to be a murderous war criminal. That’s probably a great lesson on why you shouldn’t name your child after a fictional character before their story ends. But what about an iconic (and problematic) toy that’s been around for more than 60 years and just got a wildly popular big screen apologia? Some expecting parents are clearly considering doing just that. Online baby name searches for both “Barbie” and “Ken” have gone way up thanks to Greta Gerwig’s smash blockbuster.

Warner Bros.

According to People, the baby name site Nameberry has reported a whopping 603% increases in searches for “Barbie” since the film arrived in theaters on July 21. During that time searches for “Ken” have also shot up by 293%.

That doesn’t mean 600% more “Barbies” will be joining the workforce in 20 years, though. Just because an expecting parent looks up a name doesn’t mean they’ll choose it. And it’s easy to have a big percentage spike if normal searches are relatively low to begin with. But it does mean we’ll probably be seeing at least a few more Barbies and Kens in the future than we would have without the film.

Warner Bros.

For now “Barbie” barely cracks the top 1,900 baby girl names. In a role reversal from Barbieland, however, “Kenneth” is a lot more common. It sits just outside the top 100 names for boys.

In the meantime Nameberry Editor-in-Chief Sophie Kihm tells People Barbie remains a predominantly Amish name, a fact that we’ll be thinking about on our death bed. (We will not be worried about Ken while taking our final breath. At all.)

Something tells us “Khaleesi” from the hit HBO series probably wasn’t very popular with the Amish. And not just because they waited to see what happened to Daenerys in the end.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmVyZGlzdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbGVhZHMtdG8tYmlnLXNwaWtlLWluLXNlYXJjaGVzLWZvci1iYXJiaWUtYW5kLWtlbi1iYWJ5LW5hbWVzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vbmVyZGlzdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbGVhZHMtdG8tYmlnLXNwaWtlLWluLXNlYXJjaGVzLWZvci1iYXJiaWUtYW5kLWtlbi1iYWJ5LW5hbWVzLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,The Major Detail About Ryan Gosling's Ski Suit in 'Barbie' That You Might Have Missed (Exclusive),'Barbie' costume designer Jacqueline Durran tells PEOPLE the story behind Ryan Gosling's Chanel ski suit in the movie — and how special it actually is.,"Barbie’s love of Chanel is prominently featured in this summer’s blockbuster movie of the same name — from the heart-shaped monogram bag Margot Robbie carries to the chunky necklace she wears featuring those iconic interlocking “C”s.

But the Chanel pieces in the film extend beyond what some viewers may have picked up on. Jacqueline Durran, the Oscar-winning costume designer in charge of the wardrobe for the Greta Gerwig-directed film, tells PEOPLE that even the ski suits that Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who plays Ken) wore while traversing the landscape between the real world and Barbieland are also Chanel.

And they were custom made for the actors — with Gosling's being particularly special.



“Chanel sent over the suit for Margot to put on and it was just great, but the thing is, we also needed one for Ryan. And Chanel doesn’t make menswear. So Chanel kind of went, ‘Okay, well, we'll make one for Ryan.’ So they made the only Chanel men’s ski suit in existence for Ryan.”



Durran tells PEOPLE that it had been widely known that the stars were wearing Chanel for the scene but she didn't think anyone realized just how big of a deal it was that Gosling's outfit was bespoke — and then some. While some very important people could get Chanel menswear, it's rare, because it's not something the fashion house traditionally manufactures.

""People just didn't pick up on that,"" she adds. ""Chanel doesn't do menswear!""

Durran previously worked with the famous fashion house on her other projects, including Spencer and Atonement, so it was a seamless experience bringing Chanel into Barbie.

“I enjoy working with them. I find them really supportive of filmmakers and film storytelling, and they're very supportive of the director's vision. They will help where they can,” she says.

When it came time to outfit Gosling for his extremely manly patriarchy-forward Mojo Dojo Casa House-loving Ken, though, Durran had to turn elsewhere for the wardrobe.

“In the way that Barbie is just a little bit more done up than you would ever imagine — more accessories, more clothes, more everything — Ken’s doing the same kind of thing, but with patriarchal images,” Durran says.

She points to the “core image” of Sylvester Stallone in a fur coat that’s seen in the film and says that was truly used as her basis for crafting Gosling’s whole look — from the faux mink to the layered watches and even the gaudy horse necklace.

“Everything was just extra,” she says of creating the look. “We just kept building on it, but horses were certainly the theme that kept coming back.”

Gosling was very on board with diving into the over-the-top image and leaning into the part, Durran says, even giving her feedback on the pieces she was picking for him.

“Funnily enough, I showed [the horse necklace] to Ryan after I picked it out, and he went, ‘Yep, that's the one,’ ” she says.

2023-06-21 15:13:00+00:00,Hollywood Scandal: Barbie Movie Corvette Only Half Size!,And… is it autonomous? Movie comes out July 21.,"In these troubled times, with actual, real problems in the world to get outraged about, take a moment to consider this not-so-real scandal: the Barbie Corvette in the coming Warner Bros. movie isn’t full-size! When you stop to consider the amount of time and energy expended by web commenters about perceived inaccuracies in Ford v Ferrari and, likely, in the coming Enzo Ferrari and F1 movies, this should at least register on the scale of righteous indignation somewhere. Shouldn’t it?

The first Barbie Corvette debuted in 1968, though some sources say 1970 and one claims it was 1976. As far as I could tell after spending way too much time researching it, there were numerous Barbie Corvettes over the years, from C1 to C4, at least. Argue about that one on the internet. The car that will be in the movie is based around a 1958 Convertible.

Barbie has placed her perfect plastic keister in numerous cars over her endlessly youthful lifetime. The first car seems to have been three years after her creation in 1959. That was when she got a 1962 Austin Healey 3000 MkII, her first car. It was followed by a 1962 Mercedes 190SL, 1978 Ferrari 328 GTS, 1991 Porsche 911 Cabrio, and Barbie campers too numerous to list here. There was even a “2004 Cali Girl Chevrolet SSR” pickup truck and a 2004 Ferrari F1 car. According to the exhaustive web source barbielistholland.wordpress.com there was even a “Big ATC” trike-looking thing and a very wide variety of dune buggies. There were many, many vehicles in the Barbie World.

For our purposes, the one we care about is the Corvette. Or, as it’s sometimes been called over the Barbie years, the “Dream Corvette.” In the coming movie it’s a ‘58 Convertible. The shocker in the official trailer for the movie is that it appears to be much smaller than a real Corvette (Outrage! Boycott! Squirrel!).

Click for article Barbie drives her Corvette in Barbie Land. Warner Bros.

The real 1958/59 C1 Corvette was 177.2 inches long. Estimates for what the real size of a human-sized Barbie would be range from 5-foot-9 to 7-foot-6. Who knows? The actress who plays Barbie, Margot Robbie, is 5-foot-6. In one screen-saver captured from the movie trailer, the height of Robbie the actress appears to take up about half the length of the car (138 in. divided by 177.2 = 78%), so let’s say it’s ¾ scale. When you go see the movie (when it comes out July 21) you can make your own estimate.

Not only is it smaller scale, it appears to be autonomous. In several scenes in the trailer, as well as in a very thorough analysis by Architectural Digest, Barbie is turning around, facing rearwards, waving to all her Barbie friends with both hands, as the car continues to drive forward on its own. This suggests at least Level 3 autonomy, at a minimum. But there is no visible lidar, radar, cameras, or other sensors to be found.

More useless facts if you’re still reading this far into the click bait:

Click for article Just some of the fabulous Barbie gear you can buy from Mattel. Mattel

All of Barbie’s friends, all named Barbie as well, have C1 Corvette Convertibles, but they’re not all pink like the main character’s car. In the trailer we see green, blue, and yellow models. There may be other colors.

The car is able to do a complete barrel roll in the air—with Ken unbelted in the cargo space/rear bench seat behind the front bench seat—and land perfectly with no damage to either occupant. Amazing how they skirt NHTSA safety standards and survive.

Robbie/Barbie’s head extends at least a foot above the wraparound glass windshield and yet her hair remains perfect.

Yet we must see past these trivialities if we are to fully grasp the existentialist struggle that is at the heart of this future classic: Barbie wants to leave Barbie Land, where everything is perfect, and go out into the real world—specifically Los Angeles, California, where people may be plastic but they’re imperfect. Will she survive? Will her hair survive? Will she and Ken find happiness in a non-Barbie World? We’ll find out July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9jYXItbGlmZS9jbGFzc2ljLWNhcnMvYTQ0Mjc3MTYwL2hvbGx5d29vZC1zY2FuZGFsLWJhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1wcmV2aWV3LXNtYWxsLWNvcnZldHRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

However, she wasn’t the first person to try and...","Take a look at the trailer for the upcoming film 'Barbie' directed by Greta Gerwig, starring Margot Robbie. Video / Warner Bros. Pictures

Greta Gerwig has been a big name associated with the upcoming Barbie movie and all its ensuing excitement. However, she wasn’t the first person to try and bring the “life in plastic” concept to the screen.

Sony initially bought the rights to the Barbie film back in 2014 and spent years trying to recruit actors and screenwriters to take part in the project. Hollywood stars such as Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer were said to be in the mix, the latter of whom had to pass up the opportunity due to “scheduling conflicts” in 2017.

However, Schumer recently revealed on Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live that she felt the initial script wasn’t “feminist and cool enough”.

Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody was set to write the movie in her “idiosyncratic writing style,” along with Schumer’s “crass” comedic flair. However, Cody exited the production in 2018, revealing to ScreenCrush that she “failed so hard at the project”.

“I was literally incapable of turning in a Barbie draft,” she added. “God knows I tried.”

Now, in a recent interview with GQ, the screenwriter shed light on the issues she faced while trying to imagine the original concept of ‘an anti-Barbie,’ which Cody said, “made a lot of sense given the feminist rhetoric of ten years ago”.

“I think I know why I sh*t the bed,” she told the publisher. “When I was first hired for [Barbie], I don’t think the culture had not embraced the femme or the bimbo as valid feminist archetypes yet.

“If you look up ‘Barbie’ on TikTok you’ll find this wonderful subculture that celebrates the feminine, but in 2014, taking this skinny blonde white doll and making her into a heroine was a tall order.”

Cody went on to say that she felt like she did not have “the freedom then to write something that was faithful to the iconography”.

“They wanted a girl-boss feminist twist on Barbie, and I couldn’t figure it out because that’s not what Barbie is,” she added.

During this time, The Lego Movie was gaining major traction after hitting screens under Warner Bros. in 2014. Codey remembers hearing “endless references to [the film] in development,” which affected the screenwriter’s mojo as she tried to emulate the same style, which she dubbed “meta.”

“Any time I came up with something meta, it was too much like what [The Lego Movie] had done,” Cody shared. “It was a roadblock for me, but now enough time has passed that they can just cast Will Ferrell [who played the evil tyrant President Business] as the antagonist in a real-life Barbie movie and nobody cares.”

Gerwig expressed her own concerns about making the doll-inspired movie, telling Vogue in December that she worried the film would be a “career-ender.”

“It was something that was exciting because it was terrifying,” she said. “I think that was a big part of it, like: ‘Oh, no, Barbie.’… It felt like vertigo, starting to write it, like: ‘Where do you even begin, and what would be the story?’…”

2023-08-04 22:30:00+00:00,Why Barbie Needed Michael Cera’s Allan,"In a world full of Kens, some turn out to be Allan. Here's why Michael Cera is so valuable to Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie.'","The following story contains slight spoilers for Barbie.

BY NOW, ANYONE who's seen Greta Gerwig's Barbie knows that it's far more than your typical movie based on a toy. No offense to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, but typically this is a subgenre where what you see is what you get; when you hire a filmmaker like Gerwig (whose last two films, Lady Bird and Little Women, both earned Oscar nominations), digging a bit deeper comes with the price of admission. While Barbie isn't an earth-shattering epic character study like its ""Barbenheimer"" co-headliner, it nonetheless tells an important story for our modern times: a satirical comedy adventure about how women and men fit together (and sometimes don't) in modern society.

The movie's main conflict comes when the Kens of Barbieland—led by one played with miraculous commitment by Ryan Gosling—learn how the ""real world"" operates, before brainwashing the Barbies, installing a patriarchy and spreading the gospel of horses, Sylvester Stallone, and Zack Snyder's Justice League.

But its essential to note that the simplistic-minded Kens aren't the only men in Barbie. Jump over to the real world, and there's a room full of Mattel toy executives led by a nameless CEO played by Will Ferrell. America Ferrara's Gloria also has a husband (played by her own real-life husband) eagerly teaching himself to speak Spanish. And then there's Allan.

Allan, played by the perpetually awkward (and perpetually delightful) Michael Cera, resides in Barbieland alongside the Barbies and the Kens. Helen Mirren tells us early on in narration that while there are all these different Barbies and Kens, there's only one Allan (""I'm still pretty confused about that,"" he says in response). Gerwig makes it clear early on: if Barbies think one way, and Kens think another way, then Allan—the one and only Allan—has his own way of thinking too.

His character and POV prove vital to both the movie itself and the message it's sending. When the Kens attempt their takeover of Barbieland—planning to turn it into the ""Kendom""—Allan is visually disturbed by the changes that have been implemented. And when Barbie (Robbie), Gloria, and Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) try to leave the increasingly-demented Barbieland, Allan reveals that he's snuck along for the ride; he wants to get out of there just as badly as they do. He's Ken's best friend (the company line is that all of Ken's clothes fit him), but the Kens acting like stereotypically entitled jerks makes him sick.

Gerwig is using Allan to make an important point: not every dude out there is a Ken. Some dudes do, in fact, get it. They understand that you don't have to be a macho-brained show-off in a male-dominated world to have an OK time. And Cera's awkward charm that evolves into a perturbed annoyance is the perfect depiction in his handful of scenes.

While Gerwig (and her co-writer Noah Baumbach) write Allan in a way that really serves the movie well, we have to also give some major credit for just how well this supporting character worked to actor Michael Cera, who may have just given his best performance since his 2007 breakout in Superbad in Barbie.

Everyone knows that Cera's signature is his awkward, lovable charm; he first displayed it in Arrested Development, and roles in Superbad and Juno etched it into the public's memory. If you're looking for a lovable dude who can never quite say the right thing, Michael Cera is the pick.

While he's generally played roles along those same lines through the years, he's also had some success playing against type. Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World cast him as the titular character, an early 20s dude whose essentially become a womanizer who treats the women in his life as objects without even realizing it. The movie is super inventive and fun, and Cera's flawed protagonist helps to make it something not like many other offerings out there. He also played a truly deranged version of himself in Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's apocalyptic satire This Is The End, which is just an absurd and daring role that he totally knocked out of the park.

But with Allan, Gerwig takes the awkward charm that Cera is known for and uses it to really brilliant effect. By putting it next to the macho posturing display that Kens played by Gosling, Simu Liu put on throughout the film, his quiet style pops even more. Why be a Ken when you can be an Allan?

It was reported recently that Cera only landed the role after Jonathan Groff (Mindhunter, Knock at the Cabin) had to drop out; ultimately, we'd say the right guy got the part.

Is Allan a real Barbie doll/Mattel toy?

Warner Bros./Mattel

Allan is, indeed, a real Mattel toy. Allan was named after Ruth Handler's son-in-law, and was introduced in 1964 (after Barbie in 1959 and Ken in 1961) as Ken's best friend—who could also fit into all of his clothes. Everyone loves versatile toys! Unfortunately Allan only lasted a few years on the shelves his first go-around before being discontinued by Mattel. But he would return multiple times, of course.

Interestingly enough for anyone who's seen the Barbie movie but doesn't usually get this deep into Barbie lore: Allan (sometimes just spelled as 'Alan,' reason for change/inconsistency unknown) is actually married to Midge, Barbie's pregnant friend (whom Barbie made the point of noting was discontinued, actually). They don't share a single scene together (outside of the ""Dance the Night"" dance scene) in the movie, so we'd never know if not for some hard-hitting research.

Allan has returned to shelves everywhere throughout the years, usually for some kind of family-related endeavor with Midge (which usually manages to stir up controversy and end with another discontinuation). And while there's no Allan available widely right now, we'd assume that after Mr. Cera made him such a popular commodity, it won't be long until Allans are all over the shelves—even if there's still only one of him.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQ0NzM1NDQ5L2JhcmJpZS1hbGxhbi1taWNoYWVsLWNlcmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images

When I started seeing trailers for Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” pop up in theaters, I felt solidly “meh.” The initial promos seemed aesthetic-rich but vague on plot, and I watched the growing internet hype with mild befuddlement.

At brunch, I listened to an upper-end Gen Zer who was breathlessly excited to see the movie. When I asked what in the film’s marketing spoke so deeply to her, she zeroed in on the part of the trailers where Barbie asks her friends in Barbieland if they ever think about dying, which she found infinitely relatable.

“I mean, who hasn’t felt that way in Bushwick on a late weekend night?” she said.

Well, me, an elder millennial whose Bushwick Saturday nights are long over. But I’m not a hater! I was happy that she felt excited to see “Barbie” — I just didn’t really get it. Maybe this movie just wasn’t for me, which is fine!

After all, my generation of feminists has been historically more likely to worry about the impact of letting children play with the impossibly proportioned doll than to hail her as a feminist icon for having many careers in lieu of a husband.

As a frequent theatergoer, I knew I’d likely see the movie; I just wasn’t on the same vibrating wavelength as my acquaintance and a lot of other women who seemed to feel similarly about “Barbie.”

But then the film came out, and it was everywhere. Reviewers were praising its feminist message, and groups of pink-clad women were having what looked like an absolutely fantastic time going to see it together.

And then there was the money. This movie by and explicitly for women was making so much money you almost could hope the film industry might get the memo on the power of the female consumer. (Although, as actor-turned-director Randall Park recently pointed out in a Rolling Stone interview, the takeaway for Hollywood decision-makers seems to have somehow become “make more movies about toys” instead of “make more movies by and about women.”)

Oh, and also conservative men started to get mad at the film’s portrayal of the Ken characters as expendable side notes to the Barbies’ journey — which was a little funny, since it seems like 90 percent of Hollywood movies treat women as exactly that with impunity. It was also a little amusing to see adult men getting angry that a movie about a dress-up doll largely associated with little girls wasn’t catering specifically to them.

I love a good cultural phenomenon and I love to see women having fun, especially fun that isn’t reliant on male approval. So when I finally saw “Barbie” the second weekend after its premiere, I was ready to get on board. (It helped that I went to a private screening where the theater seats were redone in pink leather.)

And the movie was fun! The script was clever, the sets and staging inventive, the performances on point. (I especially enjoyed Issa Rae’s delivery of each and every one of her too-few lines.) In the end, I had a great time watching “Barbie.”

It wasn’t perfect, but we tend to hold women and their work to the impossible standard of being all things to all people. Whenever I notice that the criticism of something a woman does is becoming especially vitriolic, I try a thought exercise where I ask myself, “Do we treat men in this situation the same way?” Many people seemed to be expecting an awful lot from “Barbie” and Gerwig that they don’t demand of the Martin Scorseses or Quentin Tarantinos of the world.

Still, perhaps hypocritically given my last point, I do have one gripe with the film.

It’s not the movie’s only problematic moment ― OK, we get it with the “cellulite is gross” jokes ― but again, it’s a doll movie, so I didn’t expect it to be beyond critique. And the flaws don’t negate all the things that the movie does very well. But this one line bothered me, and it has continued to bother me in the weeks since, as people share the quote on social media like it’s a heartwarming sentiment.

The line comes when Barbie stumbles into the otherworldly kitchen of Ruth Handler, the creator of Barbie. While drinking tea, Barbie asks Ruth (played by the amazing Rhea Perlman) for permission to become human. Comparing Barbie to her own daughter, Barbara (for whom she named Barbie), Ruth says she doesn’t need permission. Then she delivers the line I’ve since seen praised widely as “impactful” and “profound”: “We mothers stand still so that our daughters can look back and see how far they’ve come.”

It sounds meaningful I guess, on the surface, and is delivered like a sage truth. Some people I’ve spoken with were emotionally affected by it, and I respect their point of view.

I also can’t speak to having a daughter specifically; I’m raising a son. But as a mother, when I heard this line, I instantly wondered why the hell I’m supposed to be content to be left behind. Why should social progress only benefit one generation of women, or any other marginalized group for that matter? Why can’t all of us move forward together?

The line conveys a message that seems at odds with the rest of the film. It’s America Ferrera’s character, a mom, who gets to deliver the script’s big ol’ feminist monologue ― which is so powerful that it’s able to “deprogram” the patriarchy-brainwashed Barbies. Her character doesn’t stand still ― she gets to serve as a feminist role model for her daughter, rather than meekly watch her daughter surpass her. (“Bye, honey! Have fun! I’ll just be here in this ... ghost kitchen!”)

In a movie with a shouted “feminism for everyone!” as its thesis, Ruth’s line felt to me like a whispered addendum excluding moms from the party. It seems like par for the course in a society that expects women to quietly disappear once we have kids, subsuming our identities into the sacred role of motherhood.

It shouldn’t need to be said, but moms are also still women, and we need and deserve the benefits of gender equality just as much as the future men and women we happen to be raising. While I certainly appreciate the sacrifices that so many women made to help create opportunities for future generations, I prefer to live in a world where nobody has to stand still.

2023-07-04 15:12:16.538000+00:00,"Barbie Gets 12A Age-Rating in the UK for Bad Language, Innuendo, and Dangerous Behavior","Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie has received a 12A age-rating in the UK for strong language, moderate innuendo, dangerous behavior, and more.","Barbie is out of her box and ready to party (ah, ah, ah, yeah) in her big screen debut this summer, and the UK's 12A age-rating is warning viewers of strong language, moderate innuendo, and dangerous behavior.

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has given Greta Gerwig's upcoming Barbie movie a 12A age-rating, meaning an adult must accompany anyone under the age of 12 to see the plastic-fantastic feature in theaters on July 21. The BBFC suggests adults consider whether it's suitable by checking the content advice for the film in advance.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling star in the movie as Barbie and Ken, but they soon discover life is not all about dressing up, blowout parties, and rollerblading as they get expelled from Barbieland and dropped into the real world to discover the joys and perils of living among humans.

Now we have some clues about the threats they will face, as the BBFC listing for Barbie confirms the movie contains ""moderate innuendo"", ""brief sexual harassment"", and ""implied strong language"".

Loading Play

The second teaser trailer for Barbie gave us a glimpse at some of the ""comic fight scenes"" referenced in the content advisory, as Gosling's Ken competes with Simu Liu's Ken for Barbie's attention, with each threatening to ""beach off"" the other. But apparently there will be ""undetailed punches, kicks, headbutts"" and the ""use of improvised weapons"" in the movie as well as occasional gags about ""sugar daddies"".

A scene involving sexual harassment was also briefly shown in a previous trailer and has appeared on the BBFC's report, stating ""men catcall a woman and make inappropriate comments about her appearance"". It also mentions ""a man slaps a woman's bottom, however, his behaviour is immediately challenged and results in negative consequences"".

Additionally, the organization details ""infrequent scenes of mild threat"", including a car chase, and ""dangerous behavior"" in a scene wherein ""a child melts a doll's hair using a lighter"". There is also the use of ""bleeped strong language,"" moderate bad language, and milder terms, plus ""occasional verbal references to death and mental health"" and ""patriarchal attitudes about women's roles in society"".

The BBFC entry also confirms Barbie has a runtime of 113 minutes and 54 seconds, putting it just under one hour and 54 minutes, so those planning Barbenheimer viewings at the theater will need to spare plenty of time for it as Christopher Nolan's R-Rated Oppenheimer clocks in just shy of three hours on its own.

,Liam Neeson’s Morning Commute Turns Deadly with a Ticking Bomb in ‘Retribution’ Trailer: Watch,Liam Neeson returns to the big screen on Aug. 25 with new high-speed thriller 'Retribution.' Watch the trailer for the action-packed thriller,"Liam Neeson is back in action in the trailer for his latest thriller.

The official trailer for Retribution, the 71-year-old actor’s latest movie, was released on Wednesday morning. In true Neeson fashion, it includes everything from high-speed car chases to an abundance of fiery explosions.

When an anonymous caller warns Neeson’s character, Matt Turner, of the bomb under his car seat, he begins a high-speed chase across the city to complete a series of brutal demands. Turner’s innocent commute turns deadly when he realizes pressure triggers on his seat will detonate the bomb if he or his two kids leave the car. In a twisted game of life or death, Neeson’s character has no choice but to follow the cryptic commands and try to save his family.

“Listen very carefully, or I kill you” the distorted voice booms eerily over Turner’s phone in the trailer. Neeson’s character is instructed to open his glovebox, revealing a weapon he’s supposed to use to kill his friend in another car. When Turner instead throws the weapon to the ground, his friend’s vehicle immediately goes up in flames. “You’re a murderer now, Matt,” the innominate voice interjects.

LIONSGATE



The film also includes appearances from Matthew Modine, Noma Dumezweni, Jack Champion, Lilly Aspell and Embeth Davidtz.

This is not the first film where Neeson finds his character in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Since starring in Taken in 2008, the actor has played countless variations of the rugged hero who finds himself in twisted, deadly encounters. From The Marksman to Blacklight, he’s solidified his position as an action movie mogul — with no end in sight.

Even though he told Entertainment Tonight in 2021 that his age was accelerating his retirement from the genre, Neeson’s growing list of upcoming projects says otherwise. In addition to Retribution, the actor has upcoming roles in a catalog of films, including In the Land of Saints and Sinners and Thug.

""I think the action movies will draw to a close — they have to,"" Neeson said in a TODAY interview in 2022. ""Audiences aren't stupid, you know. They're gonna go, 'Oh, f— this guy, Liam Neeson. He's got to be 71, 72, 73...' I'll stop at some stage.""

Retribution is in theaters Aug. 25.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9saWFtLW5lZXNvbi1yZXRyaWJ1dGlvbi10cmFpbGVyLXdhdGNoLTc1NTQ2ODXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Charli XCX releases 'Barbie' song 'Speed Drive,' used to behead hers","Charli XCX celebrated the release of her new 'Barbie' movie song, 'Speed Drive,' by revealing she used to behead her Barbies when she was younger.","This Barbie isn't afraid to play rough.

On Friday, Charli XCX celebrated the release of her latest single, ""Speed Drive,"" which will appear on the upcoming Barbie movie soundtrack, by revealing that she used to give her Barbie dolls quite the makeover.

""Won't lie, I did used to behead my Barbies,"" the singer tweeted, before adding, ""but really happy to be on the soundtrack tho!""

The song, which clocks in at just under two minutes, is a hyper-pop ode to everyone's favorite Mattel gal, describing her as ""my best friend in the whole world"" and the ""inspo"" on every mood board. Charli XCX then encourages Barbie to put the pedal to the metal and ""jump into the driver's seat and put it into speed drive"" in the full-throttle chorus.

She also took a moment to break down some of the various references within the track, writing, ""Literally can't believe I name-checked Van Gogh, Voltaire, Devon Lee Carlson, and Barbie all in one song. That's genius.""

She continued, ""And I simultaneously sampled Robyn's cover of Teddybears' ""Cobrastyle"" and interpolated 'Micky'?! I'm a f---ing mathematician.""

And, if that wasn't enough, Charli XCX also seemed to tease where moviegoers will be able to hear ""Speed Drive"" in Barbie. She retweeted a fan account that referenced a recent TheFortyFive interview with Barbie soundtrack producer Mark Ronson, who hinted that the song may play during a car chase. Let's just hope Ken (Ryan Gosling) is not still hiding in the backseat with his rollerblades when it happens!

""When you're telling someone where you want their song in the film, everyone wants to hear 'opening credits' or 'closing credits,' but not 'car chase,'"" he said. ""I remember Charli asked: 'Where are you thinking this song is gonna go?' And I said, 'Err, I dunno, car chase?' under my breath. And Charli just said: 'This speaks to me in an immense way.' Because Charli is just so amazing and she just loves that raw energy.""

""Speed Drive"" is one of many tracks that will show up on the highly anticipated Barbie soundtrack, which features performances from PinkPantheress, Lizzo, Karol G, Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, Haim, and more. The album's lineup is equally as star-studded as the film's cast, which includes Gosling, Margot Robbie, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Helen Mirren, and more.

Barbie crashes into theaters July 21. Listen to ""Speed Drive"" above.

,America Ferrera on delivering her big Barbie monologue,America Ferrera felt the pressure to get her empowering 'Barbie' monologue right.,"Barbie Land advisory: This article contains spoilers for Barbie.

Ryan Gosling has seen his Barbie costar America Ferrera's TED Talk, much to her endearing surprise.

""You watched my TED Talk?"" a stunned Ferrera asks during EW's Around the Table with the cast and director Greta Gerwig (above), conducted prior to the actors' strike.

""I love your TED Talk,"" Gosling replies in earnest, calling it powerful and prompting a moved reaction from the Ugly Betty Emmy winner and activist.

Titled ""My Identity Is a Superpower,"" the moving soliloquy about knowing and loving who you are within a non-inclusive, repressive system is not unlike her big monologue in Barbie.

America Ferrera in 'Barbie'. Warner Bros. Pictures

As Gloria, a human and Mattel employee from the real world with a special connection to Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie, Ferrera's character plays a central role in the restoration of Barbie Land. When the feminist utopia is overtaken by the Kens, spearheaded by Gosling's central Ken after he's corrupted by the real world and the patriarchy (though he was only in it for the horses, so maybe give the misguided doll a break on that one), the Barbies become brainwashed and submissive. It's an impassioned spiel from Gloria — centered on all the traps that accompany womanhood, weighed down by impossible societal expectations — that help break the spell, returning the Barbies to their natural form.

Both Gloria and Stereotypical Barbie — oh, and good ol' Allan (played by an excellent Michael Cera), who simply does not subscribe to the Kentriarchy — one by one kidnap the brainwashed Barbies to deliver the big monologue and break the spell.

""It's such a powerful moment in the movie and every time I've seen it, people erupt in applause,"" Gosling tells Ferrera. 'It feels so true. And what's even more powerful about it is that it feels so authentic to you because you have had so many moments in your career where you've said the truthful thing at the right time. Your TED Talk is a great example.""

Margot Robbie, Alexandra Shipp, Michael Cera, America Ferrera, and Ariana Greenblatt in 'Barbie'. Warner Bros. Pictures

For Ferrera, ""I mostly tried to forget about it 'till I had to do it,"" she admits of preparing for the daunting monologue, citing her anxieties to get it right. ""Greta didn't make it easy,"" she says. ""You were like, 'There's a monologue. Meryl Streep says she would like to do this monologue. I was like cool, no pressure!'""

The big scene, which occurs at Weird Barbie's (Kate McKinnon) eclectic dreamhouse, was shot toward the end of production, ""so it felt like I was holding it for a long time and the energy was building, building, building,"" Ferrera explains. ""My experience of the moment was that Greta gave me so much space and so much trust. I obviously didn't wanna eff it up. I wanted to do it justice."" It was easier to tap into, she observes, once it occurred to her that it was rooted in truth-telling at its core.

""There's no woman in my life that this isn't true for,"" Ferrera says. ""So like, how do you tell the truth? That was the goal."" With Gerwig's trust, she adds, ""I felt like I could go to all the places because I had so much trust that you would know what was right for the movie... I felt like that was freedom, to have so much trust in the leader of like, 'She'll know, so I'm free to do what I want and she'll make it right.'""

The movie and its pastel-pink empowering themes have so far largely garnered rave reviews, with EW's Devan Coggan hailing it as ""fierce, funny, and deeply feminist"" in her A- critique. ""It's Gerwig's care and attention to detail that gives Barbie an actual point of view, elevating it beyond every other cynical, IP-driven cash grab,"" she writes, adding, ""Turns out that life in plastic really can be fantastic."" Even before release, though, the film quickly captured the cultural zeitgeist, with leaked set photos and the trailer's infamous arched feet shot feeding the anticipation.

Of the fervor, Robbie, also a producer on the film, offers: ""I think Barbie's been capturing people's attention since the day she was invented. She is an icon but she's a very complicated one. There's been times when Barbie has been ahead of her times and there's been times when she's been behind her times, but she's always been evolving. I feel like this movie's the next evolution.""

,Barbie movie review & film summary (2023),"A lot like Barbie the doll: ravishing to look at, but with much more on its mind than initially meets the eye.","“Barbie” can be hysterically funny, with giant laugh-out-loud moments generously scattered throughout. They come from the insularity of an idyllic, pink-hued realm and the physical comedy of fish-out-of-water moments and choice pop culture references as the outside world increasingly encroaches. But because the marketing campaign has been so clever and so ubiquitous, you may discover that you’ve already seen a fair amount of the movie’s inspired moments, such as the “2001: A Space Odyssey” homage and Ken’s self-pitying ‘80s power ballad. Such is the anticipation industrial complex.
And so you probably already know the basic plot: Barbie (Margot Robbie), the most popular of all the Barbies in Barbieland, begins experiencing an existential crisis. She must travel to the human world in order to understand herself and discover her true purpose. Her kinda-sorta boyfriend, Ken (Ryan Gosling), comes along for the ride because his own existence depends on Barbie acknowledging him. Both discover harsh truths—and make new friends –along the road to enlightenment. This bleeding of stark reality into an obsessively engineered fantasy calls to mind the revelations of “The Truman Show” and “The LEGO Movie,” but through a wry prism that’s specifically Gerwig’s.
This is a movie that acknowledges Barbie’s unrealistic physical proportions—and the kinds of very real body issues they can cause in young girls—while also celebrating her role as a feminist icon. After all, there was an astronaut Barbie doll (1965) before there was an actual woman in NASA’s astronaut corps (1978), an achievement “Barbie” commemorates by showing two suited-up women high-fiving each other among the stars, with Robbie’s Earth-bound Barbie saluting them with a sunny, “Yay, space!” This is also a movie in which Mattel (the doll’s manufacturer) and Warner Bros. (the film’s distributor) at least create the appearance that they’re in on the surprisingly pointed jokes at their expense. Mattel headquarters features a spacious, top-floor conference room populated solely by men with a heart-shaped, “Dr. Strangelove”-inspired lamp hovering over the table, yet Will Ferrell’s CEO insists his company’s “gender-neutral bathrooms up the wazoo” are evidence of diversity. It's a neat trick.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-18 23:00:34+00:00,Barbie Is Very Pretty But Not Very Deep,Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a mosaic of many shiny bits of cleverness with not that much to say. Read TIME's review.,"The fallacy of Barbie the doll is that she’s supposed to be both the woman you want to be and your friend, a molded chunk of plastic—in a brocade evening dress, or a doctor’s outfit, or even Jane Goodall’s hyper-practical safari suit—which is also supposed to inspire affection. But when you’re a child, your future self is not a friend—she’s too amorphous for that, and a little too scary. And you may have affection, or any number of conflicted feelings, for your Barbie, but the truth is that she’s always living in the moment, her moment, while you’re trying to dream your own future into being. Her zig-zagging signals aren’t a problem—they’re the whole point. She’s always a little ahead of you, which is why some love her, others hate her, and many, many fall somewhere in the vast and complex in-between.
With Barbie the movie—starring Margot Robbie, also a producer on the film—director Greta Gerwig strives to mine the complexity of Barbie the doll, while also keeping everything clever and fun, with a hot-pink exclamation point added where necessary. There are inside jokes, riffs on Gene Kelly-style choreography, and many, many one-line zingers or extended soliloquies about modern womanhood—observations about all that’s expected of us, how exhausting it all is, how impossible it is to ever measure up. Gerwig has done a great deal of advance press about the movie, assuring us that even though it’s about a plastic toy, it’s still stuffed with lots of ideas and thought and real feelings. (She and Noah Baumbach co-wrote the script.) For months now there has been loads of online chatter about how “subversive” the movie is—how it loves Barbie but also mocks her slightly, and how it makes fun of Mattel executives even though their real-life counterparts are both bankrolling the whole enterprise and hoping to make a huge profit off it. The narrative is that Gerwig has somehow pulled off a coup, by taking Mattel’s money but using it to create real art, or at least just very smart entertainment.

It’s true that Barbie does many of the things we’ve been promised: there is much mocking and loving of Barbie, and plenty of skewering of the suits. But none of those things make it subversive. Instead, it’s a movie that’s enormously pleased with itself, one that has cut a big slice of perfectly molded plastic cake and eaten it—or pretend-eaten it—too. The things that are good about Barbie—Robbie’s buoyant, charming performance and Ryan Gosling’s go-for-broke turn as perennial boyfriend Ken, as well as the gorgeous, inventive production design—end up being steamrollered by all the things this movie is trying so hard to be. Its playfulness is the arch kind. Barbie never lets us forget how clever it’s being, every exhausting minute.
That’s a shame, because the first half-hour or so is dazzling and often genuinely funny, a vision that’s something close to (though not nearly as weird as) the committed act of imagination Robert Altman pulled off with his marvelous Popeye. First, there’s a prologue, narrated by Helen Mirren and riffing on Stanley Kubrick’s 2001, explaining the impact of early Barbie on little girls in 1959; she was an exotic and aspirational replacement for their boring old baby dolls, whose job was to train them for motherhood—Gerwig shows these little girls on a rocky beach, dashing their baby dolls to bits after they’ve seen the curvy miracle that is Barbie. Then Gerwig, production designer Sarah Greenwood, and costume designer Jacqueline Durran launch us right into Barbieland, with Robbie’s approachably glam Barbie walking us through. This is an idyllic community where all the Dream Houses are open, not only because its denizens have no shame and nothing to hide, but because homes without walls mean they can greet one another each day with the sunrise. “Hello, Barbie!” they call out cheerfully. Everyone in Barbieland—except the ill-fated pregnant Midge, based on one of Mattel’s many discontinued experiments in toy marketing—is named Barbie, and everyone has a meaningful job. There are astronaut Barbies and airline pilot Barbies, as well as an all-Barbie Supreme Court. Garbage-collector Barbies, in matching pink jumpsuits, bustle cheerfully along this hamlet’s perpetually pristine curbs. This array of Barbies is played by a selection of actors including Hari Nef, Dua Lipa, Alexandra Shipp, and Emma Mackey. The president is also Barbie—she’s played by Issa Rae. (In one of the early section’s great sight gags, she brushes her long, silky tresses with an overscale oval brush.)
Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Shipp, Robbie, Nef, and Emma Mackey lose it when Barbie’s feet go flat Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures
Barbieland is a world where all the Barbies love and support one another, like a playtime version of the old-fashioned women’s college, where the students thrive because there are no men to derail their self-esteem. Robbie’s Barbie—she is known, as a way of differentiating herself from the others, as Stereotypical Barbie, because she is white and has the perfectly sculpted proportions and sunny smile of the Barbie many of us grew up with—is the center of it all. She awakens each morning and throws off her sparkly pink coverlet, her hair a swirl of perfectly curled Saran. She chooses an outfit (with meticulously coordinated accessories) from her enviable wardrobe. Her breakfast is a molded waffle that pops from the toaster unbidden; when she “drinks” from a cup of milk, it’s only pretend-drinking, because where is that liquid going to go? This becomes a recurring gag in the movie, wearing itself out slowly, but it’s delightful at first, particularly because Robbie is so game for all of it. Her eyes sparkle in that vaguely crazed Barbie-like way; her smile has a painted-on quality, but there’s warmth there, too. She steps into this role as lightly as if it were a chevron-striped one piece tailored precisely to her talents.
Barbie also has a boyfriend, one Ken of many Kens. The Kens are played by actors including Kingsley Ben-Adir and Simu Liu. But Gosling’s Ken is the best of them, stalwart, in a somewhat neutered way, with his shaggy blond hair, spray-tan bare chest, and vaguely pink lips. The Kens have no real job, other than one known as “Beach,” which involves, as you might guess, going to the beach. The Kens are generally not wanted at the Barbies’ ubiquitous dance parties—the Barbies generally prefer the company of themselves. And that’s why the Kens’ existence revolves around the Barbies. As Mirren the narrator tells us, Barbie always has a great day. “But Ken has a great day only if Barbie looks at him.” And the moment Robbie does, Gosling’s face becomes the visual equivalent of a dream Christmas morning, alight with joy and wonder.

You couldn’t, of course, have a whole movie set in this highly artificial world. You need to have a plot, and some tension. And it’s when Gerwig airlifts us out of Barbieland and plunks us down in the real world that the movie’s problems begin. Barbie awakens one morning realizing that suddenly, nothing is right. Her hair is messy on the pillow; her waffle is shriveled and burnt. She has begun to have unbidden thoughts about death. Worst of all, her perfectly arched feet have gone flat. (The other Barbies retch in horror at the sight.) For advice, she visits the local wise woman, also known as Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), the Barbie who’s been “played with too hard,” as evidenced by the telltale scribbles on her face. Weird Barbie tells Robbie’s confused and forlorn Barbie that her Barbieland troubles are connected to something that’s going on out there in the Real World, a point of stress that turns out to involve a Barbie-loving mom, Gloria (America Ferrera), and her preteen daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who are growing apart. Barbie makes the journey to the Real World, reluctantly allowing Ken to accompany her. There, he’s wowed to learn that men make all the money and basically rule the land. While Barbie becomes more and more involved in the complexity of human problems, Ken educates himself on the wonders of the patriarchy and brings his newfound ideas back to empower the Kens, who threaten to take over the former utopia known as Barbieland.

By this point, Barbie has begun to do a lot more telling and a lot less showing; its themes are presented like flat-lays of Barbie outfits, delivered in lines of dialogue that are supposed to be profound but come off as lifeless. There are still some funny gags—a line about the Kens trying to win over the Barbies by playing their guitars “at” them made me snort. But the good jokes are drowned out by the many self-aware ones, like the way the Mattel executives, all men (the head boob is Will Ferrell), sit around a conference table and strategize ways to make more money off selling their idea of “female agency.”
The question we’re supposed to ask, as our jaws hang open, is “How did the Mattel pooh-bahs let these jokes through?” But those real-life execs, counting their doubloons in advance, know that showing what good sports they are will help rather than hinder them. They’re on team Barbie, after all! And they already have a long list of toy-and-movie tie-ins on the drawing board.
Meanwhile, we’re left with Barbie the movie, a mosaic of many shiny bits of cleverness with not that much to say. In the pre-release interviews they’ve given, Gerwig and Robbie have insisted their movie is smart about Barbie and what she means to women, even as Mattel executives have said they don’t see the film as being particularly feminist. And all parties have insisted that Barbie is for everyone.
Barbie probably is a feminist movie, but only in the most scattershot way. The plot hinges on Barbie leaving her fake world behind and, like Pinocchio and the Velveteen Rabbit before her, becoming “real.” Somehow this is an improvement on her old existence, but how can we be sure? The movie’s capstone is a montage of vintagey-looking home movies (Gerwig culled this footage from Barbie’s cast and crew), a blur of joyful childhood moments and parents showing warmth and love. Is this the soon-to-be-real Barbie’s future, or are these the doll-Barbie’s memories? It’s impossible to tell. By this point, we’re supposed to be suitably immersed in the bath of warm, girls-can-do-anything fuzzies the movie is offering us. Those bold, bored little girls we saw at the very beginning of the film, dashing their baby dolls against the rocks, are nowhere in sight. In this Barbieland, their unruly desires are now just an inconvenience.

2023-07-18 23:00:10+00:00,‘Barbie’ Review: Out of the Box and On the Road,"She’s in the driver’s seat, headed for uncharted territory (flat feet!). But there are limits to how much dimension even Greta Gerwig can give this branded material.","Written by Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, the movie introduces Barbie on yet another perfect day in Barbie Land, in which dolls played by humans exist in what resembles a toyland gated community. There, framed by a painted mountain range, Barbie and a diverse group of other Barbies rule, living in homes with few exterior walls. With their flat roofs, clean lines and pink décor — a spherical TV, Eero Saarinen-style tulip table and chairs — the overarching look evokes the era when Barbie first hit the market. It’s very Palm Springs circa 1960, an aesthetic that could be called bubble-gum midcentury modern.
Gerwig has fun in Barbie Land, and in her role as a friendly playmate, she works hard to ensure you do too. She takes you for a leisurely spin, cranks the tunes, stages some old-school, Hollywood-style musical numbers and brings in those eternal sidekicks, the Kens (with a scene-stealing Ryan Gosling chief among them). The production design (Sarah Greenwood) and costumes (Jacqueline Durran) offer ticklish pleasure but also underscore this place’s artificiality. Barbie, et al., are of our world and not, existing in a plasticky paradise that proves less hospitable when she begins having un-Barbie thoughts and experiences: She thinks of death, and then her feet, which are molded to fit high heels, go flat.
This change to Barbie’s body is played for laughs — the other Barbies are horrified — but it’s crucial to the plot and to Gerwig’s intentions. Once Barbie’s feet touch the ground, she seeks advice from a misfit version of the doll (the invaluable Kate McKinnon), who prescribes Birkenstocks and a trip to the real world. Soon, Barbie — with Ken riding shotgun — journeys into something like reality; that they land in Los Angeles reads like a puckish joke. There, Barbie is astonished to discover sexism, and Ken is delighted to discover patriarchy, contrapuntal revelations that generate further comedy and something like enlightenment.
Gerwig handles the transition between realms smoothly, but even in this bouncy, happy movie, reality proves a bummer. It’s amusing when Barbie points out a billboard filled with women, mistaking them for the Supreme Court because that’s what the court looks like in Barbie Land, just with more pink. She learns how wrong she was, which is to Gerwig’s point. But the weight of our world, emblematized at least for this viewer by the real Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, proves unbearably heavy. However politically sharp, the gag is an unpleasant reminder of all the profoundly unfunny ways in which this world, with its visible and invisible hands, tries to control women, putting them into little boxes.
Mattel has long tried to reconcile Barbie with the real world. The toy’s origins lie with Ruth Handler, a founder of Mattel who wanted to make a doll for girls like her daughter, Barbara. Handler found her inspiration in Europe with an adult-looking German doll called Bild Lilli that Mattel reconfigured. Some buyers pushed back: “The idea of a doll with breasts was not received well,” Handler said in a 1994 Lilith magazine interview.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTgvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The Cut’s staffers discuss what they thought of Greta Gerwig’s latest movie.,"It’s fantastic. Photo: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
It finally happened: On Friday, the Barbie movie premiered, convinced everyone you know to scrounge something pink from the back of their closet, and stacked $155 million in ticket sales over its first weekend alone. Now that we’ve seen the film that was shrouded in pink mystery all year, we have a few questions: Who would actually buy a Mojo Dojo Casa House? Has anyone ID’d the year and designer of Barbie’s palazzo pants? Will there ever be justice for men named Allan?
She’s everything, he’s just Ken, and we’re here to talk about all things Barbie for the last time. (At least until awards season when we hope Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling receive their rightful acknowledgment from the various entertainment academies.) Spoilers below, obviously.
Brooke Marine, deputy culture editor: I really enjoyed this movie — enough to see it twice — and to be honest, I liked it even more on the second viewing.
Allison Davis, features writer: I accidentally saw this movie three times. I think two is optimal.
Danya Issawi, fashion news writer: I’ve never finished a movie and wanted to see it again immediately until this one.
Brooke: It does have “again, again!” vibes once the “Barbie Girl” remix starts playing. So, first question: Would you buy Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House?
Tarkor Zehn, producer, In Her Shoes: ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Danielle Cohen, news writer: If I were a horse girl, perhaps …
Tariro Mzezewa, morning blogger: Hell to the no, to the no, no no. You just know podcasts were recorded in that house.
Tarkor: Ken was very representative of current-day manosphere culture. It was giving white Kevin Samuels.
Brooke: I did think the movie has smart things to say about how the patriarchy hurts men, too. (Especially ones named Allan.) And I don’t expect a big-budget studio movie to carry the burden of being ideologically sound on every level or of being radical, which so many other people apparently seem to demand from this movie. Also, I don’t care about the plot holes. It was fun.
Danielle: I thought it was far from ideologically sound, but (maybe this is sacrilege) had far more interesting things to say about masculinity than about anything else. In a way, that was productive for us all to chew on.
Brooke: I also loved catching the references … some Lubitsch, some Cukor, some Gene Kelly. Like, sorry for enjoying a mainstream cultural moment that really is fun for the whole family! The last time I felt moved to participate in something of similar caliber and scale was when Renaissance dropped last year.
Tarkor: Yes! A tad heavy-handed on the 2013 feminist monologue, but I’ll deal.
Danielle: More than a tad, I would say.
Brooke: Now, you know you can’t get through a Gerwig joint without a monologue …
Tariro: I loved America Ferrera’s monologue, even if it was extremely girlbossy! It reminded me of her monologue in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants after the brick. But the final montage was a bridge too far for me.
Allison: Ryan was acting with every li’l millimeter of his eyes. So much pathos and fun and confusion and love.
Tariro: Oscar for Ryan, IMO. But Margot was also excellent.
Danielle: I rolled my eyes a bunch, but also I cried!! I think Ryan stole the show, but incredible mime acting from Margot. And she’s a great crier.
Matthew Schneier, features writer: I also thought Margot Robbie was legitimately terrific. Like … an Oscar-winning doll? I thought Ryan’s acting was good — I seem to be in the minority on not being blown away — but I really need him to get a Men’s Health cover so I can understand how a man in his mid-40s has that body. I mean, the pecs! The topography …
Allison: I took my 7-year-old nephew, who is now obsessed with Ken. His three questions: What is a fascist? What is a gynecologist? How is Ken SO BUFF!
Danielle: The three mysteries of life!
Brooke: Matthew, I agree. And I figured some of the abs were sprayed on, but there was a biceps flex that was a little shocking to me … what was the routine? Also: Justice for Allan.
Tariro: Michael Cera’s timing was so good!
Danielle: I think my favorite line of the movie was “All his clothes fit me.”
Danya: Michael Cera was incredible. Ken never said sorry for the coup :/
Brooke: I am obsessed with “I’m Just Ken” and the moment their war turns into a Gene Kelly musical.
Danielle: The way this movie loved choreography really brought me joy.
Brooke: The giddyap-ing on the fake horses sent me. I have to ask: Over which outfit do we want to make the most commotion? The palazzo pants made me laugh, but I rolled my eyes a bit at Stereotypical Barbie’s Chanel handbag — the heart-shaped one near the end.
Danielle: I guess it’s to be expected, but this is the best press Chanel has ever gotten. Has anyone been able to identify the archival outfits Ken threw off the Dreamhouse’s second floor?
Tarkor: COWGIRL BARBIE SNAPPED!
Danya: Everyone is going to be Cowgirl Barbie for Halloween.
Tariro: A girl in my theater was already in the cowgirl outfit.
Katja Vujić, social-media editor: I was very into Issa’s president jumpsuit at the end. Tracksuit? Either way, so good. Also loooved the cowgirl fit.
Danya: I loved Issa, she ate.
Tarkor: Issa ate downnn.
Brooke: Tom Stourton appearing for .2 seconds to play Earring Magic Ken: I was chuffed to see him.
Danielle: I love that Weird Barbie was always in the splits. The way that doll stuff translated to humans was so imaginative and fun! Like, yes, of course that fucked-up doll was tossed into a bin, legs fully splayed out.
Brooke: Ken’s favorite song being “Push,” by Matchbox Twenty, is genius.
Matthew: Unfortunately, I also love that song and felt chastened.
Brooke: I was sad to discover that Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet were supposed to have cameos but were too busy.
Danya: Absolutely tragic. What do you mean, you’re busy? Can’t make enough time for your own mom?
Danielle: I’m okay with that. It was crowded enough as is. But imagine: The Kens learn about the patriarchy, then become completely undone by Timmy’s entire vibe.
Tariro: I am scared to ask this but … did anyone else think Barbie shouldn’t have chosen to be human?
Danya: Yes. Like, hello, Barbieland is chill again, and your friends are there??
Allison: YES. It was a horrible choice! You just spent two hours learning how bad the real world is, and also you’re gonna die now.
Brooke: Rhea Perlman literally told her being alive sucks, and she still chose that … damn.
Jordan Larson, features editor: I honestly thought she was gonna die at the end, though I guess becoming human is kinda like dying?
Allison: Being alive sucks and then you die. And that’s what you chose!?
Danya: Barbie will be on SSRIs in six weeks.
Allison: That and the pale-pink Birkenstocks felt like a betrayal.
Katja: The shot of the Birks at the end thrilled me.
Danielle: Depression Barbie incoming.

,"Barbie opening day box office beats Batman, Spider-Man, more","The opening-day box office total for Margot Robbie's 'Barbie' beat out other grosses for movies starring Batman, Spider-Man, and Marvel superheroes.","Life in plastic is looking pretty fantastic for Barbie's tiny purse.
Warner Bros. announced Friday that its Margot Robbie–starring, Greta Gerwig–directed blockbuster collected a whopping $22.3 million box office gross from Thursday night previews, beating out similar one-night totals from high-profile tentpoles like The Batman ($21.6 million), Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($17.4 million), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($17.5 million), Top Gun: Maverick ($19.3 million), Avatar: The Way of Water ($17 million), The Hunger Games ($19.8 million), and more.
That means Barbie is pacing to take in at least $130 million over the weekend, which would be a landmark total for a Hollywood film directed by a woman.

Robbie stars in the well-reviewed project as the titular doll, who, alongside Ken (Ryan Gosling), travels to the ""real"" world from her plastic toy kingdom as she dives deeper into an existential crisis.
The movie has thus far received glowing praise from critics and audiences, holding an 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and posting a score of 81 on Metacritic.
Barbie has been playfully pitted against Christopher Nolan's (much darker) three-hour historical drama Oppenheimer, which also opened Friday and is pacing for a lower box office bow despite earning higher critical praise.
""In terms of how they moved and how they behaved, I wanted it to feel heightened, but I didn't want it to feel like a sketch,"" Gerwig recently told EW of designing Barbie's musical sequences. ""So all the Barbies and Kens you see on the beach [and other dance sequence settings] hold themselves differently. Our choreographer said dancers, their bodies always have a direction that's different [from] normal people. So that was kind of like in this conception of Barbie Land, it's like a soundstage musical.""
Barbie is now playing in theaters nationwide.

If you don’t keep up with the film industry and went to a movie theater this weekend, you might’ve been confused by the sea of pink when you entered. Many of those who went to see “Barbie,” which premiered over the weekend to record-breaking success, dressed in pink to celebrate the titular character’s signature color.
“Barbie” received generally positive reviews from critics, with a “Certified Fresh” score of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Boston.com staff writer Kevin Slane gave the film three out of four stars in his review of the movie.

“More than anything, ‘Barbie’ is one of the most subversive, unexpected summer blockbusters in recent memory,” he wrote.
We asked Boston.com readers to review “Barbie” out of four stars. A majority (57%) of the 43 respondents gave the movie a one-star review using the same four-star scale.
How many stars would you give 'Barbie' ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (I loved it!) 29% 12 ⭐⭐⭐ 7% 3 ⭐⭐ 7% 3 ⭐ (It was awful) 57% 24
Some readers wrote in with split feelings on “Barbie.” Those who loved the film, such as Joan H. from Northampton, brought up how the film showed a variety of emotions in its two-hour duration.
“It was silly and ridiculous and funny, and then, wham! It was meaningful, soulful, important … and very, very moving,” she said.
Others who who didn’t like “Barbie” disagreed with the message the film sent about feminism and female empowerment.
“Two hours of man-shaming and feminism forced down your throat. I understand empowering women, but not at the expense and embarrassment of men,” said reader Julie from Newton. “I felt uncomfortable seeing this movie with my boyfriend and brother. There are better ways to accomplish the goal and communicate a message — in a positive, constructive way.”
Boston.com readers on Facebook had similar thoughts, with many differing views of the film. Some found the film to be better than expected.

“Was it what I expected? No. It was so much more than I could’ve ever anticipated,” one user wrote.
Other Facebook users also mentioned their disagreement with the message the movie was sending, and one person said Ken was their favorite character, which was ironic since the movie is about Barbie.
Readers also had their favorite moments of the movie. One of the most popular scenes for Boston.com readers was America Ferrera’s monologue detailing the near-impossible expectations of women in today’s world. At some theaters, such as reader Jen M. from Braintree’s, her monologue garnered praise before anyone had even left the building.
“When America Ferrera went on her rant about being a woman in today’s world. I clapped at the end of it,” she said.
Below are some readers’ reviews of “Barbie” with various star ratings, as well as some favorite moments from the film.
Some responses have been lightly edited for clarity.
⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4-star reviews
“I smiled the whole time. Just felt so amazing to be able to laugh about things that get me down in real life and see all those beautiful women get their Barbie moment. Greta never misses.” — Claire S., Allston

“Great acting, loved the story, it was fun and serious at the same time. And it made me think. The hallmark of any good movie.” — Jen M., Braintree
“The many themes of this one movie overwhelmed me … in a good way. My thinking changed multiple times throughout the film as to what Barbie is supposed to represent. Ryan [Gosling] was a very pleasant surprise and added so much to the story. And, yes, Gloria’s monologue was brilliant! I am a 76-year-old mother and Granny to a daughter and three granddaughters and every single word she spoke was absolutely true. And, yes, I cried as Ruth held Barbie’s hand and spoke to her about mothers and daughters. An incredible movie I never expected to love so much.” — Beth G., Columbia, Ct.
“The movie was much much better than I expected. And it would have gotten an easy 4 stars from me just for the satire/comedy; but the poignant/tearful/gut wrenching scene(s) — I counted two of them — ratcheted it right up to 5 stars. America Ferrera’s monologue on the contradictory expectations foisted on women by society and Typical Ken’s plaintive soul searching monologue after the beach wars are both award winning performances.” — Sissy, Midland
⭐⭐⭐ 3-star reviews
“It was creative and stylish with a message. On the downside, it was too long and at times, I lost interest.” — Mike, Watertown
⭐⭐ 2-star reviews
“The plotting did not make sense because Barbie left Barbieland because of her feet and her visit to Mattel was contrived. Also, Ken was made to look stupid, and the message was that women can manipulate men — nice.” — David K., Newport Beach, Ca.
⭐ 1-star reviews
“Horrible — horrible — waste of time and money. Didn’t know I was paying to be preached to about feminism, patriarchy, etc. Awful!” – Dee D., Westwood

2023-07-23 07:00:34+00:00,"Barbie review – a riotous, candy-coloured feminist fable",Barbie takes a ride from her dream house to reality as Little Women writer-director Greta Gerwig takes another cultural icon and lovingly subverts it,"Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s cinematic reinvention of Mattel’s most (in)famous toy comes on like a sugar-rush mashup of Pixar’s Toy Story 2, Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio, the cult live-action feature Josie and the Pussycats and the Roger Ebert-scripted exploitation romp Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. It’s a riotously entertaining candy-coloured feminist fable that manages simultaneously to celebrate, satirise and deconstruct its happy-plastic subject. Audiences will be delighted. Mattel should be ecstatic.
After a heavily trailered 2001-parody opening, we move to a pastel pink haven in which, “thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved”. This is Barbieland – a fantasy world in which big-haired dolls can be anything (lawyers, doctors, physicists, presidents), thereby inspiring equivalent feminine achievement out there in the “real world”. (“We fixed everything so all women in the real world are happy and powerful!”)
Without Margot Robbie this audacious flim-flam could well have fallen flat on its face
Like a dreamy version of the nightmarish Being John Malkovich, everyone here is Barbie. Except the men, who are just Ken. Or Allan (a hapless Michael Cera). But mainly just Ken – an appendage without an appendage. At the centre of all this self-referential fluff is producer-star Margot Robbie’s “Stereotypical Barbie” – a role so perfect that when Helen Mirren’s narrator makes a sardonic gag about the casting, no one minds. So it comes as a surprise when this habitually smiley creature finds herself haunted by thoughts of sadness, anxiety and death. Worse still, she develops flat feet and (whisper it!) cellulite – two horsemen of the Barbie apocalypse.
A visit to Kate McKinnon’s “Weird Barbie” (“she was played with too hard”) reveals that a wormhole has opened between this world and the next. Now, like Amy Adams in Enchanted, our fairytale heroine must take a ride to reality, accompanied by Stowaway Ken (Ryan Gosling), who promptly discovers The Patriarchy, in which men (and horses) are in charge!

Meanwhile at Mattel HQ, Will Ferrell is reprising his Lego Movie role as the adult quasher of childish dreams, demanding that Barbie get “back in the box”. But by now, Barbie has met gothy teen Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who tells her that “you’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented”, adding; “You set the feminist movement back 50 years, you fascist!” Far from saving the world, Barbie seems to have helped create a dystopia in which “men look at me like an object” and “everyone hates women!”.
There’s something of the rebellious spirit of Todd Haynes’s 1988 cult classic Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story about Gerwig’s deceptively upbeat blockbuster. Haynes’s zero-budget underground masterpiece (which has never had an official release) used increasingly disfigured Barbie dolls to tell the tragic story of a talented musician whose life was overshadowed by anorexia. Yet in Gerwig’s multiplex-friendly spectacular, this spectre of unrealisable expectation is slyly reconfigured into a weirdly liberating parable about being whatever (size, profession, attitude) you want to be – whether Ken and The Patriarchy like it or not.
There are jokes about the red pill from The Matrix, the snow globe from Citizen Kane, the male “meaning” of Coppola’s The Godfather, and fanboyish emotional overinvestment in Zack Snyder’s director’s cut of Justice League. Yet Barbie is never anything less than inclusive – meaning that young(ish) fans raised on such animated staples as Barbie in the Nutcracker and Barbie of Swan Lake will find as much to cheer about as wizened old critics looking for smart film references. Like her terrific 2019 adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, Gerwig’s latest has no intention of ditching its source material’s core audience, even while allowing those with more snooty cinephile tastes to excuse their enjoyment of her film by comparing it with canonical works.
A smart script, co-written with Noah Baumbach, reminds us of Mattel’s constant attempts to reinvent their product (Earring Magic Ken;Palm Beach Sugar Daddy; inflatable breasts Skipper – yes, really) and their embarrassed discontinuation of models that incurred consumer/retailer ire. It all culminates in an entertainingly feisty dismantling of male power (“He took your home; he brainwashed your friends; he wants to control the government”), pepped up by Gosling’s deliciously vacuous apex-Ken performance and carried shoulder-high by Robbie, without whom this audacious flim-flam could well have fallen flat on its face. A moving cameo by Rhea Perlman as the creator of all this madness lends a touch of heartfelt pathos. But it’s Robbie and Gerwig (along with the production designers and songwriters) who make this fizz, ensuring that everything is awesome, even when it isn’t.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8yMy9iYXJiaWUtcmV2aWV3LWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXJ5YW4tcmlvdG91cy1jYW5keS1jb2xvdXJlZC1mZW1pbmlzdC1mYWJsZdIBgAFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8yMy9iYXJiaWUtcmV2aWV3LWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXJ5YW4tcmlvdG91cy1jYW5keS1jb2xvdXJlZC1mZW1pbmlzdC1mYWJsZQ?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-26 21:50:03-05:00,Barbie Movie Review: The Film Paints A Miserable World For Young Girls,The new Barbie movie paints a miserable world for young girls. It's not one I want to live in.,"The new Barbie movie paints a miserable world for young girls. It’s not one I want to live in.
I finally broke down and went to see the new “Barbie” movie. First, I read Ben Shapiro’s scathing review and read the elite, liberal media articles mocking his scathing review. I really have no interest in the movie, but you can’t write a review about something you don’t see.
I tried to go into the movie with an open mind, although I refused to join the hordes of women and young girls (preteens, teens, etc.) decked out in hot pink. A friend of mine said, “Does everything have to be political?” In other words, can’t people just enjoy a movie without it bogging down in our country’s divisive culture wars? Sure, I said, but this movie is trying to SEND a cultural message, and it’s doing it to kids. So it’s fair game that we analyze that message.
The movie was worse than I expected. Sure, it’s well-crafted, a sugar-high Candy Crush or Candyland type world of fantasy and satire, with Oscar-worthy acting by lead Margot Robbie, great sets, and snappy dialogue. The movie muddles its message at the end, making it somewhat confusing what it’s trying to say. It comes around to the right message at the end, that women should be able to be whatever they want, including a mother.
The problem is that it puts down men to get there, and it never corrects that.
Why are we supposed to be celebrating a movie that tells little girls that all men are sexist, superfluous jerks?
For most of the movie, “Barbie” creates a miserable world for young girls, where men are figures of ridicule who are not necessary or worthy of any admiration. There is not a single admirable man in the movie. It’s not a world that I want to live in. It’s also divorced from actual reality.
The movie has two worlds; there’s “Barbieland,” painted as a female-led utopia, where everything is plastic and perfect, no one has cellulite, everyone is happy all of the time, and, as Barbie notes, men are “superfluous” jokes. And then there’s the “real world,” which is painted as a patriarchal nightmare dominated by catcalling, sexist he-men. There is no in between. There is no “world” where men and women interact with mutual respect and recognition that each gender gains something from the other.
The movie opens with a scene of young girls in a desert smashing baby dolls as it informs viewers that, until “Barbie” came along with her many careers, little girls were forced to play with baby dolls and role play as mothers. This is painted as such a horrific thought that the baby dolls end up with their heads smashed to bits on rocks. I’d call that an abortion analogy, but the liberal, elite media would go wild on me. A woman is the president in “Barbie Land,” and the Supreme Court is made up of women too. For all the female power, though, it’s a pretty cold, plastic world.
There is a mother in the “real world” who looks tired, frumpy and exhausted and confesses how hard it is running around after kids.
Ken is painted in “Barbieland” as an effete, de-masculinized, basically castrated figure, who is powerless, stereotyped, and mocked by Barbie, whose affections he is desperate to get. He gets his worth through Barbie’s attention. Barbie rejects him throughout the entire movie, rendering him pathetic and declaring, “Ken is totally superfluous.”
He fares no better in the “real world,” where he prances around drunk on patriarchy, excited about horses and trucks and thinking he can get a job just because he’s a man. The real world is described as a place where “men rule, literally,” and Ken even chooses a book on the origins of patriarchy from a school shelf. Then he returns to Barbieland, and promptly starts turning it into Kenland, and the other Barbies end up subservient to the Ken dolls and brainwashed. Both worlds are miserable extremes.
At one point, Barbie even tells Ken, “I don’t want you here. It’s Barbie’s dream house, not Ken’s dream house.”
That’s the message the movie gives to young girls. Prioritizing the “I.” There is no “they” or “we” in this movie. There is no “their dream house.” Men exist as characters of ridicule. That doesn’t mean the movie doesn’t have funny moments. When all of the Kens strum away at their guitars thinking the eye-rolling Barbies will love their songs, who can’t relate?
My idea of a dream, utopian world, is different. It’s one where men and women both feel valued, and where they thrive together in equality. Empowering women doesn’t mean men need to lose their power.
In my dream world, men and women enter into loving relationships, and they create loving families. Sure, if you don’t want to have kids, that’s a choice some people make. However, the messaging in this movie reminds me of the messaging in the ’80s, when women were encouraged to be so career-focused that some waited too long to have families, and now they’re bitterly regretting it.
I don’t want a world where men are stereotyped and devalued. At least on the right and in the Midwest where I live, they generally are not. I also don’t want a world where gender is eradicated; the movie avoids that trend, at least.
I think the world is better with men in it, and many women appreciate and find masculinity attractive. It’s not something we should make fun of, discourage or depress.
I think it’s great when women have a career (I’d be bored without intellectual stimulation and have always had one) but being a mother is a cherished gift that is unparalleled on this earth (I’m one of those too).
Newsflash to the “Barbie” writers, but, in the real world, the U.S. Supreme Court has four women, a woman is vice president and, until recently, a woman was Speaker of the House. In contrast to the warped, unrealistic sexist “real world” in “Barbie,” there’s an argument that men are the ones who are degraded today. Women now outnumber men in the U.S. college-educated labor force, for example. More than three-fourths of suicides are among men, to cite another example.
A healthy society devalues neither.
Is there some sexism in the “real world” today? Sure. There’s some. I’ve rarely had a female boss in any of my professions, for example, and I’ve felt sometimes that I have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously. I’ve been objectified and sexualized when men are not. However, I generally feel that women today have the power to create their own paths, whether that’s becoming a mom, having a career, or, hopefully, both. The movie nominally makes this point toward the end, when it inundates the viewer with images of mothers and daughters, and showcases a mother and daughter who befriend Barbie, and argues suddenly that women can be anything they want, but that’s after it spent almost two hours convincing us that Ken and all men are misogynistic idiots, and women are better off without them.
I played with Barbies as a kid. However, in contrast to the movie, I imaginatively pretended Barbie had a career, but also that she found true love with Ken. I liked that dual fantasy. I also enjoyed putting her in pretty clothes. She was just part of my imaginative childhood. I also created a stand to sell my mother back her old magazines from the basement, forced my poor brother to play school when he was done with school, and wrote a 28-page crime novel in fourth grade.
I never once considered smashing the heads of baby dolls or considered Ken to be “superfluous.” That would never have entered my mind, but this movie is planting in the minds of many impressionable girls that men are superfluous morons.
It’s tempting to praise the “Barbie” movie for, at least, recognizing that binary gender exists, except it falls into the trap of old-school feminists who believed empowering women means disempowering men. It doesn’t. Men and women have different power; masculine and feminine energy are different, and they should be able to not only exist side-by-side but also build one another.
Barbie is gender on steroids. I did laugh when they tried to negate the criticism that she is a “white savior” character with a subtle aside. I remember the days when feminists hated Barbie because she was white, blonde, and too thin. Interesting, then, that they picked “stereotypical Barbie” as the protagonist.
By denigrating men and trying to convince impressionable young girls that they’d be better off without them or without babies, I think “Barbie” is painting a crass and damaging picture of a real world I wouldn’t want to live in and don’t believe exists. Well, it’s the world as seen through the “woke” “feminist” viewpoint admired by the left, I suppose, and maybe it exists in liberal enclaves on the coasts. There’s an entirely different reality out here in the Heartland.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpc2NvbnNpbnJpZ2h0bm93LmNvbS9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3L9IBNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpc2NvbnNpbnJpZ2h0bm93LmNvbS9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3Lw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

All the hours","By Teagan Durkin
We all knew it was coming. The relentless, hot pink, techno pop advertising was impossible to escape. Outfits in every shade from cerise to coral were planned months in advance. Memes dominated social media as far as the eye could scroll.
Watching the Barbie movie was a nostalgic trip. All the hours I had spent playing with my own dolls, orchestrating everything from fashion shows to espionage missions, came flooding back as I watched my childhood toys come to life on the big screen. This movie differed from the other 43 movies—Barbie is a skilled self-promoter—in two key ways, however.
First, it was live action, thus eliminating the inevitable cringe associated with poorly aged animation. Second, its meta-awareness twisted the typical Barbie script.
For some, Barbie is simply a childhood toy. For others, Barbie captures so many of the unrealistic expectations women deal with on a daily basis: they must be absolutely beautiful no matter what they’re actually going through, but not look like they’re trying too hard; they must accomplish extraordinary professional success, but not so much that it threatens people around them; and they must have well-developed independent interests, but also be a family-centered and dedicated parent. If one put Barbie’s actual plastic proportions on a real woman, she would fall over. The waist-hip ratio itself would be enough to topple.
The film is aware, however, that Barbie can simultaneously inspire people and push them to achieve an impossible standard. In an impassioned speech toward the end of the film, America Ferrera captures this perspective perfectly.
I expected the film to reference numerous tidbits of Mattel’s illustrious history. Along with nestling plenty of easter eggs for the observant viewer, the movie also delivered on a strong plot. I found myself fully engaged through both roller-skating missions and the more thoughtful moments that poignantly captured human beauty. But as much as I personally enjoyed the film, certain aspects, like the overall message and dialogue, were occasionally oversimplistic and childish. But I acknowledge that I, a college student, am not Barbie’s target audience. These factors didn’t deter me from dressing up in hot pink nail polish for a hilariously sweet time.
Despite the well-researched authenticity of the extravagant Dreamhouse decor and classic Mattel couture, I was disappointed that the film missed the mark on one key element. All of the Barbie dolls, and even Ken if we must count him, were completely inaccurate. Only Kate McKinnon portrayed what a Barbie actually looks like the moment it leaves its protective packaging: hair chopped off, crayon streaked face, and a permanently haunted look.

2023-08-09 13:30:00+00:00,Bill Maher’s ‘Barbie’ Movie Review Is a Total Embarrassment,The sexagenarian talk show host apparently had a very bad time at the cinema with “a woman in her 30s” seeing the billion-dollar ‘Barbie’ movie.,"You may have heard that Bill Maher hated the Barbie movie — an all-too-predictable outcome for a 67-year-old crank who some HBO exec thinks is “edgy” because he spends so much of his airtime railing against “wokeness.” You’d think someone whose film acting CV includes winners like Pizza Man, Tomcats, and Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death would have a bit more self-awareness; then again, this is not one of Maher’s strong suits.
On Monday afternoon, the Real Time host took to the platform formerly known as to crank out a 365-word review of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, a summer blockbuster about the titular Mattel doll (played by Margot Robbie) who transports herself into the real world only to learn that women-ruled Barbieland is a far cry from our patriarchal reality. Ken (Ryan Gosling), after stalking her through the portal, comes to the realization that he no longer wishes to be a friendzoned accessory, goes full incel, and leads the other Kens in a hostile takeover of Barbieland, transmogrifying it into a men’s rights activist’s wet dream filled with “Mojo Dojo Casa Houses.” The movie was released to near-universal critical acclaim and has grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making Gerwig the first solo female director with a billion-dollar movie.
Maher tweeted that Barbie was “preachy” and “man-hating,” while also calling it a “#ZombieLie,” which is a phrase he is desperately trying (and failing) to make happen. He goes on to criticize it for taking certain creative liberties to drive home its point — namely, depicting the Mattel board as all-male in the film when it is not, and having the Barbies “act helpless” to trick the Kens in the third act, quipping, “Helen Gurley Brown called, she wants her premise back.” The comedian also boasted of seeing Barbie “with a woman in her 30s who said, ‘I don’t know a single woman of any age who would act like that today,’” and implied that the “patriarchy” is a thing of the past because “45% of the 449 board seats filled last year in Fortune 500 companies were women,” adding, “I can see the world around me, and I can read data.” Editor’s picks
OK, ""Barbie"": I was hoping it wouldn't be preachy, man-hating, and a #ZombieLie – alas, it was all three. What is a Zombie Lie? Something that never was true, but certain people refuse to stop saying it (tax cuts for the rich increase revenues, e.g.); OR something that USED to be… — Bill Maher (@billmaher) August 7, 2023
Well, apparently Maher can’t “read data” very well. He appears to have misread (or deliberately misinterpreted) a recent report commissioned by Deloitte and the Alliance for Board Diversity concluding that 46.5 percent of board seats in Fortune 100 companies were made up of women and minorities (not just women). Of all Fortune 500 companies, the report concluded that only 22 percent of board seats were given to women and minorities, while 78 percent of board seats in the Fortune 500 were held by white men. Women also only make up about 12 percent of the world’s billionaires, their bodies are currently being legislated against across the U.S. (and world), and, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, the gender pay gap in the U.S. has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, with “women earning an average of 82.2 percent of what men earned.” Hell, in Maher’s own arena of late-night television, there are a grand total of zero female hosts after Amber Ruffin’s Peacock show was recently downgraded to a series of specials. And, unlike the fictional realm of the Barbie movie, there’s never been a female president in the U.S.
Yes, Bill, the patriarchy is real, and we are a long way from gender equality in this country.
As for his plot criticisms, I’m still a bit baffled by Maher’s issue with the Barbies acting “helpless” in the third act to trick the oblivious Kens, and Maher quoting his thirtysomething movie date as saying, “I don’t know a single woman of any age who would act like that today” as evidence that the film is somehow far-fetched. Aside from the fact that this is a spin on a classic movie trope — damsel acts distressed to trap dim-witted guy — and is a blatant act of subterfuge on the part of the Barbies, the Barbies are … Barbies. Barbieland is not a real place, and the way people behave in Barbieland is not meant to be realistic (quite the opposite). This is satire, Bill! Related
Maher concludes his review of sorts by saying that, despite everything he wrote, the Barbie movie “is fun, I enjoyed it — but it IS a #ZombieLie.” Look, let’s call this what it is: a 67-year-old man tweeting out an angry, hashtag-filled review of the Barbie movie to make headlines. And we haven’t even touched on the most embarrassing part of it: At one point, Maher brands the Barbie movie “so 2000-late” — a nod to a Fergie line from the Black Eyed Peas’ 2009 anthem “Boom Boom Pow” where she raps, “I’m so 3008/You so 2000 and late.” And he dropped this cringeworthy, decade-plus-old line in a screed about the Barbie movie being out of touch. I think it’s time to log off, sir.
Perhaps the first reactionary troll to publicly lose their mind over the Barbie movie was Ben Shapiro, a Hollywood nepo baby (the son of a TV exec and a composer) who has apparently harbored a grudge against the industry ever since he was rejected from a writing gig on CBS’ The Good Wife. Shapiro made a YouTube video called “Ben Shapiro DESTROYS The Barbie Movie for 43 Minutes” (caps are his) that saw him burn Barbie dolls over a barbecue and decry its “wokeness” — an embarrassing display even for him.
In recent years, Maher, like Shapiro, has used his Real Time megaphone to spout bad movie takes, whining about “Lady Ghostbusters,” defending Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody (Maher: “Now, the sexuality is placed in the background and it’s, where is the dick-sucking?”), you name it. Anything for those contrarian points. I’m not even sure what the hell this means:
Theres no blacks at the oscars but Felicity Jones at least sounds kind of black — Bill Maher (@billmaher) February 23, 2015
Then again, Maher couldn’t be a worse messenger when it comes to misogyny. He’s a sexagenarian who, when he isn’t dropping the N-word, has gleefully called women “bimbos” on his show. And, as one of Maher’s exes, Karine Steffans, who is Black, once said of him, “Bill wants someone he can put down in an argument, tell you how ghetto you are, how big your butt is and that you’re an idiot. That’s why you never see him with a white girl or an intellectual.”
No wonder he found the Barbie movie so triggering.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL2JpbGwtbWFoZXItYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy10d2l0dGVyLXBhdHJpYXJjaHktbGFtZS0xMjM0ODAzMTE0L9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLWZlYXR1cmVzL2JpbGwtbWFoZXItYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy10d2l0dGVyLXBhdHJpYXJjaHktbGFtZS0xMjM0ODAzMTE0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 19:20:32+00:00,"Weekend film reviews: ‘Oppenheimer,’ ‘Barbie,’ ‘The Beanie Bubble’","Critics review the latest film releases: “Oppenheimer,” “Barbie,” “The Beanie Bubble,” and “They Cloned Tyrone.”","The latest film releases include “Oppenheimer,” “Barbie,” “The Beanie Bubble,” and “They Cloned Tyrone.” KCRW gets reviews from Amy Nicholson, host of the podcast Unspooled and film reviewer for The New York Times; and Shawn Edwards, a film critic at Fox 4 News and co-founder of the African American Film Critics Association.
“Oppenheimer”
Cillian Murphy plays J. Robert Oppenheimer, aka “the father of the atomic bomb,” alongside co-stars Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. Director Christopher Nolan shot this in IMAX 70mm film. The story is based on the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.
Edwards: “You can tell that [Christopher Nolan] wanted to do this project for a really long time. … It's not a biopic per se. It's more of this really immersive character study in a cinematic op-ed. And I love the way the movie goes back to 1954 and flash-forwards. The construction and the timeline and … he really digs deep into Oppenheimer's emotional core — it's fabulous. Technically, everything about this is terrific.
… But the problem I have with it is it lacks cohesiveness and a sense of clear direction. But I'm willing to give Christopher Nolan a pass for that, because everything you see on the screen, you can tell that he just really dug in and … maybe sometimes over-thought about it. But everything that he delivers is what you want from a cinematic experience.
… It's a very heavy narrative that sometimes strays in too many directions, and it often becomes clumsy. But to the rescue are the cast, which is incredible. I mean, Cillian Murphy, he's perfection and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. And then you have the showy Robert Downey Jr. … who just reminds us that he's such a brilliant thespian. And then this really calculated and precise performance delivered by Emily Blunt.”
Nicholson: “Your tolerance for listening to people in bland rooms talk about Communism has to be very, very high to watch this movie. … This movie becomes interesting in everything that … Nolan is choosing not to show. Because you know that Nolan is a man who can do beautiful interiors and grandeur and amazing visuals. He's a man who can show anything he wants to on the screen. And he chooses so much not to in this film. He chooses to keep us in these tepid interiors.
… Nolan really respects that there's this enigma at the heart of Oppenheimer. And at the end of three hours, he wants to let him stay that way. … He doesn't want to probe, he doesn't want to show things that aren't outside of his immediate orbit. And in part of that, he chooses not to show Japan, he chooses almost not to show the war really happening at all in the background.
… The way that everybody is talking about Oppenheimer in the movie, the way all the other characters are referring to him, that he's egotistical, that he's destructive, that he's selfish, he's a womanizer — they're making him sound more interesting in dialogue than actually anything Nolan’s showing us onscreen.”
“Barbie”
Directed by Oscar-nominee Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird,” “Little Women,” “Frances Ha”), Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) are living their perfect lives in Barbie Land. Then she goes to the real world, where her normally high heel-shaped feet go flat.
Nicholson: “Greta Gerwig is really doing a great job in here, wrestling with every dimension of the Barbie phenomenon, from the range of Barbie as a role model, the woman who can do every job on the planet and owns her dream home; and the Barbie who is also a symbol of female misery, a symbol of the unrealistic pressure to be great at everything and look gorgeous doing it. And what does that do for the man in her life as well? The Ken — the most inessential man on the planet.”
Edwards: “‘Barbie’ is a sprawling, colorful, sometimes fun, but ultimately a movie disguised as a lecture on feminism. Dear parents: This movie ain't the one for kids because the themes that Greta Gerwig reaches for are way too complex and way too adult. … They packed too much into this film. And it's trying to say too many things. It's trying to do too many things.
… You have these playful musical numbers that all pretty much fall flat. They're not fun, they're not memorable. They don't push the story forward. And it seems to all be done for gimmicks and games. And you see the film winking back at the film's marketing saying, ‘Hey, this is what we want to be, but like going to the dentist, we're going to give you something else.’”
“They Cloned Tyrone”
Jamie Foxx stars in this science fiction comedy about strange events that lead three people to a government conspiracy:
Edwards: “Jamie Foxx … [is] on full display, once again proving that he may be the most versatile living actor in the business. … The thing that really makes this movie so unique is that it's part blaxploitation film, part gangster flick, part satire, part science fiction, part mystery movie, part straight comedy. And it's a combination of all those things. But it's also none of those things. This film is dealing with social commentary on race, conspiracies, and gentrification.
… It may be the most impressive first film I've seen since Spike Lee’s ‘She's Gotta Have It,” and that came out way back in 1986. This movie's inventive. It's stylish. It’s thought-provoking. It's very entertaining.”
“The Beanie Bubble”
This comedy is about the collectible Beanie Babies from the 1990s and early 2000s.
Nicholson: “Over this 15-year period that the story takes place, we're jumping back and forth, nonstop. … And yet, what we see is that Ty [Warner], even though he's going through literal facelifts, becoming a wealthy man, he is still this same insecure child who can't let any of the women in his company take credit. So in a way, this movie is really not so much about Beanie Babies. … There's not a lot of actual doll information in here. It's really more about the different forms that patriarchy takes, that it's not just muscle-bound men with mustaches, but it can be baby men who want everything their way.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3J3LmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nob3dzL3ByZXNzLXBsYXktd2l0aC1tYWRlbGVpbmUtYnJhbmQvbmV3c29tLWRpdmVyc2l0eS1maWxtLXJldmlld3MtZm9vZC9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYmVhbmllLWJ1YmJsZS1jbG9uZWQtdHlyb25l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

“Barbie” follows so-called “stereotypical Barbie” (Margot Robbie) on a humorous yet sentimental journey to self-actualization. After cracks mysteriously appear in her picture-perfect life in plastic — flat feet, cellulite, unwelcome thoughts of death and more — Barbie must seek out her owner in the real world to set things right.
Unfortunately for Barbie, her brush with reality engenders extreme angst and confusion. The same cannot be said for her companion Ken (Ryan Gosling), who quickly discovers the concept of patriarchy and covertly implements it into Barbie Land.
Watching “Barbie” feels like biting into a hefty slice of layer cake, smothered in bubblegum pink frosting and dusted with edible glitter. Though there is an obvious sweetness at first taste, unexpected flavors subsequently emerge: a generous sprinkle of bitterness, an overpowering dash of doubt and a stinging pinch of existential dread.
The movie’s absurdist tone is established in its opening sequence, which sees young girls violently abandon their baby dolls after encountering a supersized variant of Robbie’s Barbie. Smoothly narrated by Helen Mirren, the segment functions as a creation myth for Gerwig’s take on the influential toy.
Considering Gerwig’s penchant for exploring Catholic theology via film — she made her solo directorial debut in 2017 with “Lady Bird,” an eccentric coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of a Catholic high school — it is reasonable to interpret Barbie Land as a gender-swapped Garden of Eden wherein Barbie is Adam and Ken is Eve.
By flipping Genesis’ script, Gerwig nudges audiences to consider how the holistic entity of Barbie both accepts and rejects traditional femininity. After all, Barbie has grown into quite the contradiction since her inception in 1959.
Depending on who is asked, Barbie’s identity varies dramatically; she can be a feminist and pop culture icon, bimbo, career woman, unrealistic beauty standard, role model or mere object. Embraced and rejected by modern society in equal measure, Barbie must undergo constant reinvention to remain appealing.
This all too familiar struggle is finally vocalized by Gloria (America Ferrera) — the ordinary woman responsible for Barbie’s initial misfortunes — when Barbie feels paralyzingly inadequate following Ken’s coup. She denounces the everyday pressure women face to be palatable, and Ferrera’s feverishly exasperated line delivery makes for a cathartic monologue.
“I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us,” Gloria says. “And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don’t even know.”
Gerwig also allegorizes Barbie’s dollhood with real-life girlhood, making her eventual choice to become human more impactful. Her transition into womanhood is marked by a dreamlike — albeit brief — montage of home videos, all of which feature extraordinarily ordinary women simply existing. In such an exaggerated film, this scene’s understatedness shines.
If anything, “Barbie” may have been too maximalist when it came to its messages. Because so many theme ideas are at play — patriarchy’s lose-lose nature, motherhood vs. daughterhood, losing one’s identity while in a relationship, grappling with mortality — some inevitably get fleshed out more than others.
Though the movie’s plot can feel crowded at times, its lead actors never fail to entertain. Robbie and Gosling play off each other brilliantly, and the latter’s comedic chops ensure he is an utter scene-stealer.
All cast members brought a distinct flair to Barbie Land, ensuring the world felt simultaneously fresh and nostalgic. Costume designer Jacqueline Durran only added to the sheer fun of it all, creating a host of inspired looks. Every piece of clothing seen on screen, from Barbie’s disco-esque sequin jumpsuit to Ken’s “I am Kenough” sherpa hoodie, left an indelible impression.
If “Barbie” is indeed a layer cake, people are certainly hungry for more. With talks of an emergent Mattel Cinematic Universe, their craving could very well be satisfied in the future.
To that possibility, this critic says bon appétit.

2023-07-31 17:03:17.729000+00:00,‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ movie: ‘Barbie’ for teenage boys,The funny and visually innovative animated film examines what it’s like to be a 15-year-old boy through the lens of a pop culture phenomenon.,"Listen 5 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save
StarSolid StarSolid StarSolid StarOutline ( 3 stars ) “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is “Barbie” for teenage boys. Not only is it just as visually innovative and just as funny, but it has a similar mission: to examine and celebrate the complexity of an experience — in this case, what it’s like to be a 15-year-old boy — through the lens of a pop culture phenomenon. To a lesser extent, it’s also about what it’s like to parent one.
The story of TMNT, as the cool kids refer to the chelonian quartet, begins in the mid-1980s with comics by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. It’s the story of four turtles, mutated by a mysterious ooze, being raised by their adoptive father and mentor, Splinter, a mutant rat. Over the years, the foursome became a marketing juggernaut, with an animated TV show, thousands of toys and tie-ins, a couple of live-action movies, a concept album turned stage musical (yes, really), and an appearance on a Barbara Walters special (really, really). They never entirely went away but continued to lurk in the pop culture shadows with another mediocre movie here and an animated series there. Now they’re back — and what a joyful return it is.
“Mutant Mayhem” begins, unsurprisingly, with a bit of backstory about how Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo (voices of Nicholas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Brady Noon and Shamon Brown Jr., respectively) came to be. Splinter (Jackie Chan) raised the anthropomorphic reptiles from infancy after they all became infected by a substance created in a mysterious laboratory. Having experienced plenty of discrimination as an ordinary, pre-mutant rat, Splinter understandably has shunned the human world, convincing his young wards to stay in the New York City sewers to keep safe. But, just as human teens would, they decide that they know better than their perfectly rational (and much more experienced) parent and venture into the world above.

There they meet high school journalist April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri of “The Bear”), looking for the story that will save the world (and prom). She befriends the protagonists, and they start working together — the turtles to take down a gang of other mutants, led by the insectlike Superfly (Ice Cube), with April reporting on it. It’s a win-win: April impresses her peers, and the city recognizes that the turtles are heroes, giving them the acceptance they crave. Meanwhile, Splinter is grappling with the fact that his boys need him a little less and want to be on their own a lot more.

Two things make “Mutant Mayhem” stand out from the crowd: the voice acting and the visuals. The young actors voicing the turtles not only bring a unique presence to each character, but when the four are together, it’s an absolute cacophony of ribbing ridicule. Edebiri is also a standout, showing why she was a sought-after voice actor. And though Ice Cube always sounds like Ice Cube, it works.
The animation also soars. A combination of what looks like hand drawing, visible brushstrokes and a vaguely stop-motion aesthetic is reminiscent of “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” but it also feels looser and more graffitilike (and not quite as good, but what is?). Fight scenes teeter on the brink of chaos without ever going over it, and the editing is both lovely to look at and integral to keeping things on track. Throw in a few deep cuts for the parents in the audience and you’ve got a movie that your 15-year-old might actually want to see with you. Just don’t be weird or breathe too loud, and definitely don’t hug them in public and — fine, we get it. Gawd.

Seth Rogen and longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg, heading up a large team of writers, clearly have a love for the source material and a sense for how it fits into the modern world. Moreover, “Mutant Mayhem” is the rare TMNT outing that emphasizes the “teenage” part of the title, rather than “mutant,” “ninja” or “turtles.” This is a story of family and of friendship, with enough humor to keep it from getting too sappy and enough restraint to keep it from getting too sophomoric. While there’s nothing overtly inappropriate for the younger set, there are a few times when the quartet are in perilous situations that may be too much for sensitive viewers. They pass quickly.
Any parent of a boy who has turned around one day only to find that the Minecraft-obsessed child they knew has turned into a hairy, kind of stinky quasi-psychopath intent on either injuring himself or giving his mother or father a heart attack in the process will be reminded of just how special a time this is. (For parents whose sons aren’t quite there yet, buckle up, and plan on doubling your food budget.) Seeing a child start to grow into the adult they’ll become — and seeing a movie together that grapples with what that means — is a gift. A messy, loud, confusing, joyfully chaotic, over-too-soon gift.

2023-08-07 11:56:53+00:00,A strategic analysis of Barbie,The ideological hegemony and failed revolution of Barbieland.,"Photo by Warner Bros
“I want to be a part of the people that make meaning, not the thing that is made.”
Barbie
Both of this year’s summer blockbusters – Oppenheimer and Barbie – have prompted much commentary and analysis. I have already done an assessment of Oppenheimer, a movie that raises issues of strategy and morality, as well as historical accuracy. Now I turn my hand to Barbie, though I have no obvious expertise in this area. Nor are there any issues of historical accuracy as it is all pure fantasy. Yet all accounts of relationships between characters resembling humans raise issues of power and strategy, and Barbie is no exception. After all, to want to be part of “the people making meaning” could be a strategist’s creed. So, by popular demand and against my better judgement, here is my strategic analysis of Barbie.
Spoiler alert: this may make little sense even if you have watched the movie but will make none at all if you have not, and may contain sufficient information to spoil it if you intend to.
The most interesting aspect of Barbie to a strategic analyst is the revolution of the Kens, in which they install a patriarchy in Barbieland, and the subsequent successful counter-revolution which leads to the restoration of the matriarchy.

The story picks up on important themes in contemporary strategic literature, such as the emphasis on narrative and the value of an ideological hegemony as opposed to brute force in sustaining a durable political system. Barbieland, as depicted in the movie, is sharply bifurcated between the female Barbies and the male Kens. The females enjoy constitutional control, in charge of both the presidency and the judiciary. It can, however, be noted that this is largely role-playing as in the absence of any social, economic and political change, these roles do not actually require decision-making and the exercise of power. They are there to show that a matriarchy is possible rather than demonstrate one in action.

Barbieland represents a stable system in which the Barbies spend their time with each other, in harmony and prosperity. As they also have immortality, they do not need the Kens for reproduction. The Kens are confined to recreational activities even while occasionally yearning for female company.
[See also: Barbie can’t handle the truth]
The threat to this order is an external one. It turns out that individual Barbies can be affected, albeit only rarely, by the actions of their human owners. This becomes apparent when one of their number – Stereotypical Barbie – starts to show signs of ageing (cellulite) and has thoughts of death. To remedy this situation she is advised to leave Barbieland and find her original owner who must help restore her to her natural state.
In the real world, she is unexpectedly joined by her admirer, Beach Ken, who stows away in Stereotypical Barbie’s car. She finds her former owner, Sasha, but there is confusion because Sasha has rejected Barbie because of her unrealistic femininity. It is her mother, Gloria, who has played with the doll in ways that reflect her own anxieties. She does this while working in the heart of the Mattel empire, where Barbies are created.
Beach Ken makes his own discovery. He finds himself in a society in which men dominate and women are subordinate – even at Mattel. He is taken with the idea of patriarchy and steals books on the topic before returning to Barbieland. Meanwhile, Stereotypical Barbie is escaping from Mattel which – literally – wants to put her back in her box. By the time she returns to Barbieland, with Sasha and Gloria in tow, Beach Ken has successfully persuaded his fellow Kens to take control of Barbieland.
This appears to have been achieved without any strategy. The Barbie matriarchs have been convinced that life would be better in a subordinate position, and they become maids and housewives. One hegemony has been replaced by another. This is a simple role reversal. The society remains bifurcated because the Barbies and Kens still do not need each other for reproductive purposes. Only now the Kens have the best houses and enjoy partying; we are left to assume that this was a form of brainwashing. Brainwashing is a demanding process, especially with non-compliant subjects.
There is another oddity in the revolution of the Kens – they seek constitutional legitimacy through a vote on the new political order. As this has not yet taken place when Stereotypical Barbie returns, it provides an opportunity for resistance and counter-revolution. If Beach Ken had been sufficiently ruthless he would have eschewed any attempt at a constitutional transfer of power and imposed the new order by fiat. He has also failed to secure the patriarchy by rooting out potential dissident elements among the Barbies. He lacks secret police or even a network of informers among the indoctrinated Barbies. These methods are hardly Bolshevik. He is no Ken-in.
There is a small cadre of outliers who have kept their distance from the old order but are unhappy with the new, and have managed to avoid the brainwashing. One key figure is Weird Barbie, a product of earlier human interference who is able to explain to Stereotypical Barbie her predicament, and Allan, Ken’s friend who was never mass produced, and other discontinued lines. They meet up with Stereotypical Barbie’s group returning from the real world and together develop a strategy for reversing the revolution.
They must distract the Kens to kidnap the brainwashed Barbies and take them to a safe place. There they can be de-programmed and returned to their natural state. Freed, they are able to foment divisions among Kens, leading to a fight on the beach (probably not the kind Churchill had in mind). While that is under way the matriarchy is restored.
Here we can find some important strategic lessons (a number of which can be found in my 2013 book Strategy: A History – especially chapter one). First, the importance of coalitions. The counter-revolution depended on the alignment of the outliers, who knew what was going on, with Stereotypical Barbie’s group (which devised the strategy). Meanwhile the lack of unity among the Kens assured their defeat.
Second, indirect rather than direct means. Barbieland is not a violent place. Only in the real world do we see physical force actually being attempted. Even the civil war among the Kens is a lacklustre affair. Beach Ken leads a group on paddle ships while the rival Ken is carried into battle on the shoulders of his group who are riding stick horses. It turns out that the Kens do not understand the warrior role very well, and neither faction has a clear battle plan, leading to confused skirmishing.
Eventually the battle dissolves into a dance routine. While this is not a known conflict resolution technique employed by international organisations, given the success rate of their regular approaches it might be worth a try.
We are given no evidence that Kens are physically stronger than Barbies. But the Barbies demonstrate the potential of deception and misdirection. As Sun Tzu puts it, “supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting”.
Three, empathy. Put simply the Barbies are able to get away with their deception because they understand the Kens better than the Kens understand the Barbies. Much of the distraction depends on the Barbies pretending not to know things to allow the Kens to explain it to them at length.
Fourth, ideological commitment. Beach Ken does not really understand the patriarchy he is seeking to implement. He believes that it has something to do with horses and loses interest when he realises it does not. The Barbies understand the matriarchy because they have lived it before. More importantly, Gloria gives them a stirring speech of the sort expected by generals before battles (such as Henry V and Agincourt), explaining why it is important to win and to get over the idea that they must always be subordinate.
Fifth, legitimacy. Once the presidency and supreme court are restored in their old form, it is very simple to squash the rebellion. It may be the first time that they actually exercise power to affect change.
Sixth, strategic choices still have consequences. Stereotypical Barbie wishes now to return to the real world, which means reproduction (as the movie’s final line makes clear). In Barbieland there is some recognition that to avoid further rebellions more must be done to win over the hearts and minds (if not much else) of the Kens.

,Why critics are loving Barbie's Ken,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is receiving rave reviews – not least for Gosling's performance as Ken. Could he go all the way to the awards podium, asks Laura Martin.","The joy of Ken: Can Barbie's Ryan Gosling really win an Oscar?
By Laura Martin Features correspondent
Alamy/Warner Bros
Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is receiving rave reviews – not least for Gosling's hilarious performance as famous male sidekick Ken. Could he go all the way to the awards podium, asks Laura Martin.
""She's everything. He's just Ken"" So runs the humorous tagline for Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie about the Mattel doll – and her hunky male sidekick. Inspiring a flurry of memes when it was released in April, the slogan poked fun at the fact that ever since Ken came into existence in 1961, he has been seen as a slightly pointless adjunct.
Yet, as the reviews of Barbie have flooded in this week, one obvious irony has stood out: the eternal supporting player is actually the star. For no-one has been getting greater notices for the film than Ryan Gosling, playing the blonde-haired ""stereotypical Ken"" amid the innumerable variety of Kens within Barbie Land.
The surprising link between two bombshells: Barbie and Oppenheimer
Thanks to his full-throttle transformation (bleached blonde hair, fake tan, shaved legs for his neon-rollerblading scenes), impeccable comic delivery, and riotous song and dance numbers, Gosling has been earning some of the best notices of his career. ""Everyone is perfectly cast. But it's Gosling who knocks it out of the park,"" wrote Kirsten Acuna on Insider; While Beth Webb for Empire Magazine declared: ""Every muscle flex, every hair flick, every guitar strum lands perfectly. There are moments where he will rob you of breath.""
The actor has certainly gone all in on the movie, not just on-screen but off. “It's the role I was born to play, I've had this Ken-ergy, if you will. And this Ken-ergy is alive in me now,” he told MTV News, alongside a host of other hilarious, pun-filled interviews he has given around the film's release.
A twist on the himbo icon
Gosling's performance, of course, is only as good as the writing. Where Ken has always been cast as the simple, subservient partner to Barbie, then Gerwig and her partner and co-writer Noah Baumbach offer an inspired twist: the story sends Margot Robbie's ""stereotypical Barbie"" and Gosling's Ken to the 'Real World' , and while Barbie starts glitching in a bout of existentialism, we realise that Ken suffers from his own insecurities and anxieties too. He goes rogue, discovers the patriarchy, and decides to launch it back in Barbie Land.
From the simpering, lovelorn boyfriend of old, he morphs into semi-villain mode, an incel-in-training, leading his fellow Kens in revolt. He re-brands the land as his ""Ken-dom"" and takes over Barbie's Dreamhouse, turning it into a ""Mojo Dojo Casa House"". All the other Barbies, bar Robbie's protagonist, are relegated to serving the Kens, and handing out unending ""brewski beers"", and Ken takes to parading about sporting a giant mink coat and a headband – the costume director Jacqueline Durran has obviously also had a riot here.
Of the actors who have won for comic roles, few have given performances quite as absurd, exaggerated and plain silly as Gosling
The comic foil for Robbie's wide-eyed straight woman, Gosling happily leans fully into his formative all-singing, all-dancing years as a Disney Mouseketeer child star, most memorably with the hilarious performance of soft rock ballad I'm Just Ken, written by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt. His Bob Fosse-esque dance routine with all the other Kens – mid Ken vs Ken battle – is both a technical wonder and, in the way he pulls it off so convincingly, a highly-amusing reminder of just how much Gosling is willing to commit to the idea of being Ken. He embodies precisely all the Ken-ergy needed for the part.
Alamy/Warner Bros
Gosling's other skill is that even in Ken's most deluded acts, it's difficult to truly hate him. He's ultimately a misguided, slightly pathetic and pitiable character, as he peacocks around, trying to work out who he is after years in Barbie's shadow, before acknowledging his vulnerability. Gerwig told the LA Times that she was taken by Gosling's open-heartedness in portraying Ken's journey: ""He was freeing masculinity for everyone on set in this extraordinary way. And these men [on set] loved it. I think they felt released.""
What makes Gosling's performance feel so revelatory is that he's an actor so associated with films of a dark or bleaker nature; brooding, troubled characters like in Drive and A Place Beyond the Pines, or men struggling with addiction on the edge of society as in Blue Valentine and Half Nelson. He can do light entertainment, as he so skilfully showed in rom-coms Crazy Stupid Love and the all-singing, all dancing La La Land, as well as underrated comedy-thriller The Nice Guys. But he's never been quite this much fun.
Is comedy given its awards due?
Given that his turn as Ken in Barbie is as close to perfect as you'd want an out-and-out comedy performance to be, some people are already suggesting that this role could take him to Academy Award glory. Jamie Jirak from ComicBook.com was first out of the gate, suggesting on Twitter last week after an early screening: ""Give Ryan Gosling an Oscar nomination, I'm dead serious!"", a sentiment echoed this week by Lucy Ford in British GQ, who affirmed ""He should honestly be nominated for an Oscar"".
Is it fanciful thinking to think he could even go ahead and win? History shows that actors in comedies rarely succeed at the Oscars when pitted against those in emotionally wrought dramas and biopics, the likes of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny and Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets being exceptions. And of the actors who have won for comic roles, few have given performances quite as absurd, exaggerated and plain silly as Gosling. Then again, given the way Barbenheimer – the box-office battle between Barbie and Christopher Nolan's nuclear bomb epic Oppenheimer – both released tomorrow – has gripped the world, it might be that Academy Awards voters are keen to see this duel play out once again at the podium, with a host of nominations for both.
But while film critic Ellen E Jones thought Gosling ""smashed it"" as Ken, she doesn't think this will hold much sway with the Academy. ""I don't fancy Ryan's chances much at the Oscars,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""Firstly because, even though we're in this era of Awards show reform, supposedly in line with social changes in the world more generally, I believe the tedious self-seriousness which surrounds these ceremonies will be the last thing to go… and for that reason a brilliantly hilarious performance like Gosling's will not be rewarded."" She also makes the point that ""the optics of giving a man an award for what is so pointedly a feminist film are a bit off"".
Certainly though, with Ken, Gosling has cemented himself as one of Hollywood's most versatile actors. Oscar or no Oscar, he can be assured that, to paraphrase the slogan on his pastel-coloured fleece top in Barbie; he's more than Ken-ough.
Barbie is released in cinemas internationally on 21 July

,Barbie Left Us Right Where We Started,"What if the 'Barbie' move went further, and left The Box behind? A review of a film that gave us so much, and not enough.","As a young Trinidadian girl whose parents didn’t have Barbie money, I would pine over my friends’ dolls, dreaming of the day when I could own one of my own. For a young Black girl with big curly hair, the ideals of Barbie were always slightly unattainable — not only because I couldn’t afford her but also because I didn’t know many people who were that tall, that white, that blond. Still, Barbie was a significant figure for my friends so she had a hold on my imagination and even as an adult, I’m not immune to her complicated narrative. When the Barbie movie started covering every imaginable surface of pop culture in bright pink (a rather complimentary shade, I might add), I knew my kids (ages 8 and almost 4) were too young to see it, but I jumped at the chance to take my 13-year-old niece.
As a Black, antiracist feminist, I had high hopes for the movie, based not only on the reviews but on the right-wing pundits who decried the film’s “wokeness.” When racist, sexist, transphobic people tell me not to see something, you’d best believe I’ll be rushing to get my ticket. Add to that the fact that the movie royally pissed off Ginger Gaetz, wife of Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, and I was convinced this was the movie for me. When I sat in the theater, though, I was filled with complicated thoughts that left me wanting more.
They say the best movies are those that generate ongoing dialogue and I applaud Greta Gerwig’s creation for doing just that. I, for one, want everyone to see it so we can unpack it together. So I’m sharing my thoughts in hopes that it ignites yours to further this necessary and multi-layered discussion of feminism.
The following contains spoilers for Barbie.
The Barbies get community organizing.
I’ve had a hand in organizing many a march, and I can tell you that the type of shared leadership and community organizing that the Barbies did to gain back power made my little heart sing. I was like, “Yes! Reach the people one by one and then help them see their role in the movement! Give them back the power! Power to the people!”
Barbie can do hard things.
I loved that, in giving up her life in Barbie World, Barbie (played with effortless flair by Margot Robbie) did something scary and courageous that hadn’t ever been done (with success) before. Her life in Barbie World was a bit predictable, and she loved it because she held so much privilege. The Real World was full of unknowns for her (and for everyone else), but she still delved in with bravery. Yes to Barbie blazing her own path even when it’s not clear to her.
I wished that the Barbies could reimagine a whole new system.
Despite the movie’s potential, it fails to imagine outside the box of patriarchy.
Even though we live in a culture where feminism is still co-opted, misinterpreted, and debated on the right, the movie wasn’t nearly as “woke” as it had the potential to be. The film had the potential to be a graduate-level class in the impacts of grassroots organizing to create lasting change, but as much as they tried to tackle these big questions, the storyline didn’t land that lesson sufficiently. I wished that the Barbies could reimagine a whole new system — one without the tools that were used to oppress them and outside the grips of the limitations that have been put on them by these very systems. For example, I delight in imagining what the storyline could have achieved without the impact of capitalism, without the option of change in the Real World only when it is in service to the mighty dollar.
In Barbie World, Issa Rae can be president, but she can’t be the star of the film. Warner Bros. Pictures
It’s a movie that I both deeply love for what it represents for so many young and old feminists; for so many of us that need to see Black and trans and Latina representation on the big screen — and that I wish had gone even further, in envisioning a radical, bold, new existence for all of us.
If we only get supporting roles is it really representation, though?
My daughter watched Frozen for the first time six months ago. Harmless movie for a 3-year-old, right? Actually not quite, because she’s still asking for long blond hair and getting upset that her beautiful curls don’t sit straight like Elsa’s. The point of Frozen for my daughter is lost somewhere in the midst of the impact of white dominance. We live in a society where whiteness is assumed to be the norm and where it permeates so much media that surrounds our kids. Even if my daughter isn’t going to see the Barbie movie, she’s still seeing the movie posters, the ads, and so much more of the marketing that has dominated our consciousness and that continues to send the message to young Black and Brown girls that white, thin, blond people are the stars that deserve to be centered.
While I was super excited to see characters in Barbie with a variety of skin tones, hair textures, and ethnicities, the two major leads of the movie, Barbie and Ken (a platinum Ryan Gosling who exhibited an impressive range in his representation of the ills of patriarchy), were still white, blond, thin people. Yes, America Ferrera’s character, Gloria, ultimately suggested a new Barbie who would challenge these perfectionist norms, and yes, the movie acknowledged the irony of these castings — but they still chose leads that don’t reflect my children’s identity and so many other people’s.
Ultimately, the movie acknowledged the absurdity and the problem with a room full of white men running a company centered on “feminism” and geared toward little girls — and still did nothing about it.
I so wish that a Barbie movie could star an actor who isn’t what society frames as the ideal norm — even if this film does call attention to Barbie’s “stereotypical” type. Yes, that would be a totally different storyline. Yes, the plot of the movie included an analysis of those perfectionist ideals. But can we make our case and teach lessons without centering white, thin, blond normativity in the process? I think we surely can.
We have to talk about that “joke.”
The completely racist and inappropriate joke at the expense of Indigenous people that Gloria cracked was just gross. When realizing that the dolls in Barbie-land have been completely — and weirdly easily — brainwashed by the Kens’ patriarchal visions, she says, “Oh, my God! This is like in the 1500s with the Indigenous people and smallpox. They had no defenses against it!” To make light of the pain and suffering of people who are still dealing with this country’s apathy toward the impact of colonization was wrong. To the writers who still use Indigenous people as interjections to add supposed “wit,” just stop.
What does it mean that Gloria’s power only broke through in Barbie Land?
As the movie wound on, I was anxiously waiting for the end. I was sure that Gloria’s monologue — the one that snapped the dolls out of their stupor, the one that I want to play on repeat, the one that will go down in history as one of the best feminist speeches in a movie, the one where Gloria proved that she was one of the few adult humans who actually fully understood and embodied a vision for Barbie that was grounded in true liberation for all, men and women alike — I was sure that monologue would lead us to her taking over “Mattel” in the Real World. Instead, the company stayed under the control of a white dude who showed his ultimate allegiance to capitalism and not liberation. What a missed opportunity to show what feminist leadership could look like in the Real World. What a roaring feminist manifesto it would have been for Gloria to go from working for the CEO to being the CEO, replicating the feminist power of the dolls. Her trajectory fell flat, especially in contrast to the fearless leadership in Barbie World. Perhaps Gerwig is attempting to make the commentary that such a shift isn’t likely in real life, but I argue that giving space to our dreams is the first step in starting to envision and then give birth to them.
America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt play mother and daughter whose relationship changes over the movie, but their places in the real world stay the same. Warner Bros.
Ultimately, the movie acknowledged the absurdity and the problem with a room full of white men running a company centered on “feminism” and geared toward little girls — and still did nothing about it. Capable, strong women of color continuing to need permission from white men for our brilliant ideas to be accepted and brought to fruition (only if the dollar signs line up, of course) is a trait of a system that is bound to fail us over and over again.
What the Barbie movie has done for so many feminists across the world can’t be understated… and I’m dreaming about the day when Hollywood can use its radical creativity to imagine completely breaking apart harmful systems. I dream of the day when a feminist movie truly captures the type of bold change that we want to envision for this world (for us and our kids), one where undeserved power is ceded and where intersectional feminism is a core part of liberation for all, not just a bright pink paint job on oppression. I’m dreaming of centering people who belong to communities pushed to the margins in huge summer cultural phenomenons that I believe would be met with smashing box office success.
So, yes, when my kids are old enough, I will show them the Barbie movie, and we will be pausing often to unpack and discuss the ways in which it could have been more grounded in the world we want to build together — instead of merely playing with the pieces of the world we’ve inherited.

7/21/2023 6:00,Barbie Movie Review: A Look at Barbiecore,The Greta Gerwig film Barbie blends feel-good camp with moving real-world anxieties in Mattel's first buzzy movie.,"Movie studios’ love of brands and ability to convince talented filmmakers to make movies about those brands have turned big-budget auteurism into a kind of shopping-spree scavenger hunt: Rummage through these shelves and see if you can find the director’s sensibility hidden behind all the bric-a-brac. And just when it seems like the biggest brands going — superheroes of the Marvel and DC variety — might show signs of consumer weakness (however slight), along comes a New Yorker profile reiterating the plans of toymaker Mattel to enter the narrative-cinema space and entangle as many talented directors as they can in the process. (If most of these dozens of projects never come to pass, well, at least they’ll have tied up a bunch of talented for an indeterminate development period.) So far, this mission has yielded exactly one movie, arriving on a wave of hype so massive that Mattel obviously thought they could sneak some Hot Wheels and Uno excitement alongside it: Barbie, from Greta Gerwig. Yes, the writer-director behind Lady Bird and Little Women has been granted guardianship of another independent young woman who, in this case, is also an inanimate child’s plaything.
That contradiction is at the heart of Gerwig’s film, which is in part about the attempt, so common in IP-excavation, to locate a soul beneath plastic skin. Gerwig hasn’t exactly made her own movie-that’s-really-about-making-movies; Barbie isn’t quite The Life Aquatic (though it shares a co-writer in Noah Baumbach, friend of Wes Anderson and partner of Gerwig, as well as a cheerful layer of carefully constructed unreality) or Inception (though it shares some unreality with that one, too, plus a release date with Christopher Nolan’s less fanciful Oppenheimer). But it is a sincere and strange attempt to understand a fashion doll’s cultural impact (or lack thereof), both unlike anything Gerwig has made before and entirely compatible with her ongoing interest in how women attempt to live in a cruel and hostile world.
In Barbieland, that world is nowhere in sight, replaced with a welcoming expanse. Barbies of all shapes, sizes and colors enact a brand manager’s dream of disposable product as inclusive utopia. Barbie is president, Barbie is the Supreme Court, Barbie is a fun-loving DJ, Barbie is the gal next door — all that in addition to Barbie being “the Barbie that you think of when someone says ‘think of a Barbie’” (that’s the one played by Margot Robbie; Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp, Hari Nef and Dua Lipa, among others, populate the rest of the Barbie landscape). Ken is, well, also there, also in multiples, radiating a collective desire for Barbie’s attention embodied by a particularly needy version (Ryan Gosling) jockeying alongside other hunks (Simu Lu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, and so on) whose general occupation can be (and is) described as “beach.”
The Barbies are vaguely guided by the invisible hands of the kids who play with them (which explains why the Kens have much less agency overall; they’re accessories, same as the Dream Houses or the convertibles). The dolls share a spiritual connection with their unseen owners, which is why Robbie’s Barbie starts to have intrusive thoughts about death, which in turn throws her whole perfect world out of whack. She learns she must visit the real world, find the child causing these malfunctions, and, well, resolve them somehow? The movie’s plotting is sometimes ungainly (albeit knowingly so): it’s a kid-movie toy-gimmick story straight out of a screenwriting manual, overlaid with the kind of adult frustrations that resist a solution quest.
This dual-layered system means accommodating the shtickiness of Kate McKinnon, doing straight SNL as “Weird Barbie,” a guru of misfit toys whose advice is sought by our point-of-view Barbie (shorthanded as “Stereotypical Barbie”), alongside the ongoing meta-movie-star anguish of Margot Robbie, who has become an expert at conveying the panic or aggression beneath her million-watt smile and picture-perfect beauty. The truth is, she’s played spiritual dolls before; who is Harley Quinn if not the Joker’s would-be plaything imbued with vengeful action-figure sentience? In Wolf of Wall Street, she looks more like a Barbie than she does in Barbie. In Babylon, she’s a ruthlessly driven actress with eye-catching fashions, able to summon convincing ersatz emotion on command. These qualities briefly make her a superstar to be used up — played with and discarded — by the Hollywood system.
Robbie cries in close-up again in Barbie, touchingly adrift when she realizes that playing with Barbies has not, in fact, healed the world’s sexism and inspired girls everywhere to grow up to be whatever they want. This tear-stained epiphany arrives relatively early, when it feels like Gerwig is setting up a fish-out-of-water comedy where Barbie’s feminist poptimism will butt against the harsh realities of the real world. And to an extent, this is what the movie does. But Gerwig also seems to understand that in these kinds of culture-clash comedies (think of The Brady Bunch Movie from 1995), the “realness” contrasting with characters’ sunny outlooks can be just as corny, and sometimes vastly more dated, than the cartoon world that’s supposed to be rebuked (and then eventually redeemed) by this conflict. Here, Gerwig and Baumbach retain some real-world unpleasantness, like the default patriarchy that shocks and confuses Barbie (and entices her stowaway partner Ken), while also refusing to confine the cartooniness to Barbieland. The movie gets loopier and faster as it goes.
Gerwig’s tempo as a filmmaker has always been quick; even before she directed her first movie on her own, you could feel her rhythms speeding up the already-concise Baumbach as star and co-writer of Frances Ha, which made punchlines out of interrupting cuts. In Barbie, time moves elastically, even outside of Barbieland; at one point, Ken has a montage of real-world experiences that should take hours, before returning to Barbie within the space of a conversation she has with another character. Early on, the movie notes that in Barbieland, the characters can move with the shortcut suddenness of toys at play — that is, the living dolls don’t often have to go through the quotidian business of walking down the stairs and out the door, because children just whoosh their characters ahead as needed. Gerwig takes it upon herself to do the whooshing, and at times, the movie threatens to somehow outrun itself, or maybe to chase its own self-conscious tail and fall down dizzy. This is especially true when Helen Mirren’s narration track pipes in, usually without much need (and at one point practically apologizing for centering the traditionally gorgeous Robbie), applying some narrative duct tape to an intentionally cracked and inconsistent world. These explanations and excuses feel far more Mattel-mandated than the actual Mattel CEO character, unnamed and undignified. He’s played with lunacy by Will Ferrell, suggesting the kind of satire Adam McKay could have made if he wasn’t so dead set on a lecture.
Barbie does deliver some lectures of its own on the endless challenges of womanhood, mostly courtesy of Gloria (America Ferrara), a real-world professional who hangs on to her Barbie fandom out of both loyalty and desperation. Gerwig and Baumbach are writing in a more overt, subtext-forward style here; there’s not much of the characterization through dialogue seen and heard in either filmmaker’s other screenwriting, unless you count the moments where the Barbies and the Kens characterize themselves directly, which isn’t quite the same thing. One particular climactic conceit, about the self-actualizing power of giving voice to our frustrations even when we can’t solve them out of existence, could even be accused of taking a didactic view of art and self-expression: Saying the thing becomes more important than how it’s said.
But Barbie isn’t designed for that same level of intimacy as Gerwig’s earlier, smaller films — nor is it a tribute to the healing power of play a la The Lego Movie, a similarly self-referencing brand extension that both celebrates and affectionately mocks its universally known toy products. It has a more symbiotic view of how play becomes wearyingly, terrifyingly freighted with real-world meaning, which helps explain why the movie’s vision of the real world is somehow both whimsical and jaundiced. (The other explanation is that Gerwig and Baumbach, who obviously love a good, ridiculous joke, just thought it was funny to have a bunch of besuited executive types running around like hired goons.) Ken, for example, explores the delights of a society that caters to the whims of men and, as part of his bro awakening, becomes fixated on horses — less for their animal qualities than their function as an extension of manliness. As toys, in other words. The movie itself extends that tactile fakeness; though it obviously uses plenty of computer effects, its pink-centric look, where anything that can’t be reproduced in plastic is simply eliminated, has the vivid pop of a 1950s musical (or a 1990s music video playing intentionally inexact homage to decades-earlier pop culture).
All of these new filmmaker toys makes Barbie a more lumbering experience than Lady Bird, or Frances Ha and Mistress America, the Gerwig/Baumbach screenplays with which it shares its adulthood anxieties. No matter how much spring in its step — and its stars, particularly Robbie and Gosling, provide plenty — it’s less equipped to hustle and pivot with the same nimble wit as its smaller-scale predecessors. It’s carrying around the contents (and the #content) of the Mattel toybox, which seems lightweight until a few decades’ worth starts to pile up. Eventually, Gerwig uses this as an advantage; passages of this fantasy comedy are surprisingly moving. The fact that the Barbie movie traffics in no small amount of exhaustion — a bleary, triumphant attempt for Gerwig to express herself through plastic junk — makes it feel simultaneously like the first and last Mattel Motion Picture ever made. Even if it’s not the last — it almost certainly won’t be — it’s some kind of grown-up miracle that Gerwig makes that hunt for meaning into such an affirming good time.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2ZpbG0vYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLXJldmlld9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2ZpbG0vYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Margot Robbie got teased for not kissing Ryan Gosling in 'Barbie',Margot Robbie says all her friends teased her for not kissing Ryan Gosling in 'Barbie': 'What's wrong with you?',"Barbie and Ken might look like the picture-perfect couple, but in director Greta Gerwig's Barbie, they never even properly smooch.
Turns out, Margot Robbie, who portrays the new movie's titular plastic icon, is in no position to kiss and tell about her lip-locking scenes with her costar Ryan Gosling, who plays her love interest Ken — because they never happened.
When asked if she was happy not to have to make out with the actor in a recent interview with PEOPLE, the actress replied with a laugh, ""Uh, no! That didn't feel like a win for me.""
While generations of kids have passed their time making their Barbie and Ken dolls snog, Gerwig opted for a more complex take on the beloved duo's romance. As Barbie navigates the joys and perils of humanity outside Barbie Land, she also nurtures a deeper understanding of her bleach-blonde boyfriend, who's never allowed to sleep over at her place. While Robbie seemed mildly bummed about what could have been, her pals were much more disappointed.
""All of my girlfriends were like, 'Well, you did a whole movie with him, and you don't kiss?'"" said Robbie, who also served as a producer on the film. ""'What's wrong with you? I thought you were kind of in charge on this one!' I was like, 'I know, I can't check that one off [my list].'""

Meanwhile, Gosling was pleased with the bumpy road the couple's relationship takes. ""It was so funny trying to figure out what their idea of kissing might be,"" Gosling told PEOPLE, adding, ""I'm so glad all of that got cut out.""
Maybe Gosling's stance isn't that surprising given that he's spent the past few months reminding people that Ken really only exists in Barbie's shadow. Why would he get to kiss her?
Responding to some critics' claims earlier this year that he was too old to play Ken, Gosling (who's been very committed to the bit) said, ""It is funny, this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken. Like you ever thought about Ken before this?… And everyone was fine with that, for him to have a job that is nothing. But suddenly, it's like, 'No, we've cared about Ken this whole time.' No, you didn't. You never did. You never cared.""
He continued, ""Barbie never f---ed with Ken. That's the point. If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told.""
Barbie — the comedic, super-pink half of Barbieheimer — is currently in theaters, celebrating an impressive opening weekend.

,Marc Maron calls men who hate Barbie movie insecure babies,"'WTF' podcast host Marc Maron called 'Barbie'-hating men 'insecure babies' for taking offense to film, calling the Greta Gerwig film a 'masterpiece.'","Marc Maron has some strong words for conservative men raging out over Barbie, and no, it's not ""Hi, Ken!""
After watching the Greta Gerwig box office record breaker, the WTF host posted a TikTok on Tuesday that praised the movie and criticized its detractors.
Maron called Barbie's comedic depiction of men ""inspired"" and lashed out against those who found it offensive, saying that ""the fact that certain men took offense, is so embarrassing for them. I mean, so embarrassing for them. Any dude who can't take those hits in that movie, they've really gotta look in their pants and decide what they're made of. I mean, Jesus Christ, what a bunch of f---ing insecure babies.""

The comedian praised the movie as a ""masterpiece,"" citing its ability to balance effective messaging and comedy.
""It does a fairly amazing thing to create a sort of broad-based entertainment product that applies to the entire spectrum, I think, primarily of women, and then just seep it in progressive politics and basic feminism in a way that's funny, informative, well-executed in a context that is completely engaging, is f---ing monumental,"" Maron said. ""It's, you know, intentionally, thoroughly explaining feminist ideas in a way that's funny. I've just never seen anything like it.""
In an interview with The New York Times, Gerwig responded to right-wing backlash to the movie. ""Certainly, there's a lot of passion,"" she said. ""My hope for the movie is that it's an invitation for everybody to be part of the party and let go of the things that aren't necessarily serving us as either women or men.""
Any perceived controversy isn't impacting the movie's box office dominance, however. Barbie won the box office two weeks in a row, and is on its way to becoming one of the highest-grossing movies in history.

,Margot Robbie pitched Barbie by comparing it to Jurassic Park,Margot Robbie pitched 'Barbie' by comparing it to Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park.',"Before Barbie Land, there was Isla Nublar.
Barbie star and producer Margot Robbie has revealed that she pitched the movie to Mattel and Warner Bros. by comparing it to Steven Spielberg's massive sci-fi-adventure flick Jurassic Park.
""I think my pitch in the greenlight meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they're brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director,"" Robbie told Collider in a new interview. ""And then I gave a series of examples like, 'dinosaurs and Spielberg,' that and that, that and that — pretty much naming anything that's been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years.""
But the actress took things a heavy step further. ""And I was like, 'Now you've got Barbie and Greta Gerwig,'"" she added, noting that she may have tossed out a mammoth box office projection to seal the deal. ""I think I told them that it'd make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?!""
Margot Robbie in 'Barbie'; 'Jurassic Park'. Everett Collection (2)
Robbie proceeded to praise the 1993 classic starring Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern. ""Can you imagine that first meeting? They're like, 'Dinosaurs? I don't know, I mean, yeah? That might turn out kind of silly,'"" she said. ""And then here we are decades later being like, 'That's the greatest movie ever.'"" (The dino epic has grossed $1.1 billion worldwide and hatched a handful of sequels.)
And hey, should moviegoers flock to Barbie Land, Robbie's estimate may not be a total oversell. According to various box office projections, Barbie — which also stars Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, and a slew of other A-list names — is expected to rake in between $95 million and $110 million on its July 21 opening weekend, which would make it one of the biggest openings of the year.
Barbie has dominated the zeitgeist long before its theatrical release, with leaked set photos and trailers pushing anticipation to a fever pitch. Robbie addressed the fervor in EW's recent Around the Table with the cast and director Gerwig (embedded above — and recorded before the actors' strike).
""I think Barbie's been capturing people's attention since the day she was invented,"" Robbie said. ""She is an icon, but she's a very complicated one. There's been times when Barbie has been ahead of her times, and there's been times when she's been behind her times, but she's always been evolving. I feel like this movie's the next evolution.""

2023-08-04 22:50:19+00:00,‘Barbie’ movie is now set to be released in the United Arab Emirates,The United Arab Emirates has approved the release of the 'Barbie' movie after a 3-week delay over possible content issues.,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United Arab Emirates has approved the release of the “Barbie” movie after a three-week delay over possible content issues.
UAE officials didn’t explain the screening delay, which has also occurred in other Arab nations. The film is now set to screen on Aug. 10, according to a tweet by Vox Cinemas, a regional cinema company.
“The UAE Media Council has granted the Barbie movie the approval to be screened in the UAE’s licensed cinemas after completing the necessary procedures in line with the standards of media content and the UAE age classification,” the council announced late Thursday.
The movie’s inclusion of a transgender actress in one of the Barbie roles and other messaging on LGBTQ+ issues could be an issue in Arab countries with Muslim majorities that consider homosexuality and transgender identity to be contrary to Islamic religious beliefs.
The movie about the world-famous doll stars Margot Robbie in the titular role and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It also features several other actors such as “Barbies” and “Kens,” including Hari Nef, a transgender actress from Philadelphia, who plays one of the Barbies.
Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. declined a request for comment. Majid Al Futtaim, the distributor of Warner Bros. movies in the Middle East, could not be reached for comment.
In June last year, the UAE and other Arab countries initially delayed and then banned the release of “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” apparently over the inclusion of a transgender reference and the studio’s refusal to censor it.

Barbie has gone from strength to strength, as Greta Gerwig’s film continues to dominate the US box office in its second weekend.
Released on Friday 21 July alongside Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, Barbie has held unusually strongly in cinemas one week after it was released.
The comedy, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, took in a massive $93m (£72m) in its second weekend, according to studio estimates on Sunday (30 July).
Barbie has seen remarkably sustained business following its year-best $162m (£126m) opening, with ticket sales dipped only 43 per cent.
The film has also outpaced Nolan’s 2008 superhero film The Dark Knight to notch the best first two weeks in cinemas of any Warner Bros release.
It comes after Gerwig’s Mattel film broke the opening weekend record for a female director in the US. Patty Jenkins’ 2017 movie Wonder Woman held the previous record with a $103.3m (£80.3m) domestic opening.
Barbie has rapidly accumulated $351.4m (£273.3m) in screenings in the US and Canada, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box office hit of the summer. Every day it’s played, Barbie has made at least $20m (£15.5m).
You can read The Independent’s five-star review of Barbie here.
Oppenheimer again landed in second place with an estimated $46.2m (£35.9m). Nolan’s three-hour biopic held especially strong in its second weekend, with sales decreasing just 44 per cent, allowing it to accrue $174.1m (£135.4m) thus far.

The week’s top new release, Disney’s Haunted Mansion, was easily overshadowed by the enduring hype around Barbie and Oppenheimer. The film, which cost about $150m (£116m) to make, debuted with $24m (£18.6m) domestically and $9m (£7m) in overseas sales.

Haunted Mansion stars an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, but struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.
While cinemas being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to a film industry still recovering ground it lost during the pandemic, it’s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called saviour of the movies last summer with Top Gun: Maverick.
Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I, starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, grossed $10.7m (£83.2m) million in its third weekend. Its domestic total stands at $139.2m (£108.2m).
Barbie and Oppenheimer are in cinemas now.

,Review: “Barbie” proves pink is the new black,"Beautiful, brilliant, Barbie. The highly anticipated “Barbie” movie from Greta Gerwig was one that has been on my Letterboxd watch list since the first trailer was released Dec. 16, and in no way did it disappoint. Between the set design and costumes — accurate to the dolls and playhouses created by Mattel — not only was “Barbie” easy on the eyes, but pulled at every heartstring possible.","Beautiful, brilliant, Barbie. The highly anticipated “Barbie” movie from Greta Gerwig was one that has been on my Letterboxd watch list since the first trailer was released Dec. 16, and in no way did it disappoint. Between the set design and costumes — accurate to the dolls and playhouses created by Mattel — not only was “Barbie” easy on the eyes, but pulled at every heartstring possible.
The movie follows Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, on her journey to save Barbieland. Alongside other notable Barbies — such as President Barbie (Issa Rae), Diplomat Barbie (Nicola Coughlan), Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barbie (Ritu Arya), Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney), and a cast of Kens: Ryan Gosling leading the charge, closely followed by Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans, and Kingsley Ben-Adir — the movie perfectly executes an inclusive and fun environment. Every person on the screen was perfectly costumed and scripted to a tee, even Allan (Michael Cera), a discontinued doll, who brought the awkward tension of this individual character to life.
Despite Barbie’s consistently perfect days, she discovers one morning that her reality has drastically changed, her perfectly formed feet become flat, she falls out of her house and her breakfast is burnt. Normal to us, maybe, but not for the perfection within Barbieland. She heads to see Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who represents a Barbie that had been played with a little too roughly. With colored and mangled hair and sharpie drawings on her face, McKinnon’s character was the perfect edge to Barbieland.
Weird Barbie explains to Barbie that the only way that she can restore things to how they were is to go to the human world and find the doll version of herself, as whoever is playing with her is who is causing these changes. With that, we are off.
Through a combination of automotives, rocket ships, boats, vans and roller skates, Barbie and Ken make it to the real world, and are quickly awakened by the reality that is California and the United States. The two have very different experiences in this real world. Barbie is cat-called, ogled at, and overall disrespected; meanwhile Ken, for the first time, is addressed respectfully, listened to, and realizes that there are places in which men can be in control. Though it is not pleasant to watch these events, it is interesting to watch Barbie realize the cruelty of the world outside of Barbieland, and for Ken to see the benefits of men in that same world.
After an eventful day of Ken and Barbie trying to find who is playing with the Barbie doll, the CEO of Mattel (Will Ferrell) along with his entire all-male executive board, becomes aware that they are in the real world, and begins to hunt them down to send them back to Barbieland. I was worried that Ferrell would be playing another father unwilling to share his hobbies as seen in “The Lego Movie,” but I was pleasantly surprised at his character in “Barbie”, which stays light and comedic throughout the movie.
Barbie ends up being captured by the CEO and other Mattel employees but escapes with the help of Gloria (America Ferrera) and her daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). Barbie takes them back to Barbieland, only to realize that Ken has beat her back. Though his understanding of patriarchy includes not much more than horses and men being in power, the Kens, led by Gosling, alter Barbieland to fit their idea of patriarchy and take over their homes, leaving the Barbies brainwashed into a life of servitude for them.
Through the collaborations of the Barbies alongside Allan, Gloria, and Sasha, they carefully outsmart the Kens and aid the Barbies to remember who they are: doctors, lawyers, Nobel-Prize winners, and so much more. They band together and successfully restore Barbieland to what it was before.
The emotional weight of this movie was perfectly balanced with the comedic timing of the narration by Helen Mirren, special effects and dialogue of the characters. Ferrera’s role as a mother who is trying to reconnect with her daughter, while also doubling as a strong female in the real world, is crafted in a way that can give any mother, daughter, or person watching the movie a newfound respect for women of all ages.
She explains to Barbie about the real world and what it really means to be a woman, giving a powerful speech about the intricacies of existing as a female and how these expectations are basically requirements of their everyday lives. She points out the fact that they are told how to dress, how to speak, how to hold themselves, how to behave and how to accept the lack of control that women have in the real world.
Themes of feminism and the patriarchy are carefully and expertly placed throughout the entire movie, as the Kens’ position in Barbieland mimics the position women hold in the real world, and also shows the introduction of patriarchy to a matriarchy and how that plays out. Watching the roles reversed in a movie about Mattel toys is not what I thought this movie would be about, but I would be lying if I said that I was not completely moved by a movie about Barbie dolls. So rarely do we see movies that bring people together, especially women, and the opening weekend numbers alone speak to how well this movie has done this.
Lastly, I wish to applaud Greta Gerwig, who I know is receiving a large amount of praise for “Barbie,” but I don’t think any amount will ever be enough. I would have never guessed that a movie about a Mattel toy would include such an impactful cast, soundtrack, writing and overall message to walk away with, but “Barbie” will definitely be a movie that people will talk about for a long time.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaXRoYWNhbi5vcmcvNDgyMzQvbGlmZS1jdWx0dXJlL21vdmllcy9yZXZpZXctYmFyYmllLXByb3Zlcy1waW5rLWlzLXRoZS1uZXctYmxhY2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,America Ferrera on delivering her big Barbie monologue,America Ferrera felt the pressure to get her empowering 'Barbie' monologue right.,"Barbie Land advisory: This article contains spoilers for Barbie.
Ryan Gosling has seen his Barbie costar America Ferrera's TED Talk, much to her endearing surprise.
""You watched my TED Talk?"" a stunned Ferrera asks during EW's Around the Table with the cast and director Greta Gerwig (above), conducted prior to the actors' strike.
""I love your TED Talk,"" Gosling replies in earnest, calling it powerful and prompting a moved reaction from the Ugly Betty Emmy winner and activist.
Titled ""My Identity Is a Superpower,"" the moving soliloquy about knowing and loving who you are within a non-inclusive, repressive system is not unlike her big monologue in Barbie.

As Gloria, a human and Mattel employee from the real world with a special connection to Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie, Ferrera's character plays a central role in the restoration of Barbie Land. When the feminist utopia is overtaken by the Kens, spearheaded by Gosling's central Ken after he's corrupted by the real world and the patriarchy (though he was only in it for the horses, so maybe give the misguided doll a break on that one), the Barbies become brainwashed and submissive. It's an impassioned spiel from Gloria — centered on all the traps that accompany womanhood, weighed down by impossible societal expectations — that help break the spell, returning the Barbies to their natural form.
Both Gloria and Stereotypical Barbie — oh, and good ol' Allan (played by an excellent Michael Cera), who simply does not subscribe to the Kentriarchy — one by one kidnap the brainwashed Barbies to deliver the big monologue and break the spell.
""It's such a powerful moment in the movie and every time I've seen it, people erupt in applause,"" Gosling tells Ferrera. 'It feels so true. And what's even more powerful about it is that it feels so authentic to you because you have had so many moments in your career where you've said the truthful thing at the right time. Your TED Talk is a great example.""

For Ferrera, ""I mostly tried to forget about it 'till I had to do it,"" she admits of preparing for the daunting monologue, citing her anxieties to get it right. ""Greta didn't make it easy,"" she says. ""You were like, 'There's a monologue. Meryl Streep says she would like to do this monologue. I was like cool, no pressure!'""
The big scene, which occurs at Weird Barbie's (Kate McKinnon) eclectic dreamhouse, was shot toward the end of production, ""so it felt like I was holding it for a long time and the energy was building, building, building,"" Ferrera explains. ""My experience of the moment was that Greta gave me so much space and so much trust. I obviously didn't wanna eff it up. I wanted to do it justice."" It was easier to tap into, she observes, once it occurred to her that it was rooted in truth-telling at its core.
""There's no woman in my life that this isn't true for,"" Ferrera says. ""So like, how do you tell the truth? That was the goal."" With Gerwig's trust, she adds, ""I felt like I could go to all the places because I had so much trust that you would know what was right for the movie... I felt like that was freedom, to have so much trust in the leader of like, 'She'll know, so I'm free to do what I want and she'll make it right.'""

The movie and its pastel-pink empowering themes have so far largely garnered rave reviews, with EW's Devan Coggan hailing it as ""fierce, funny, and deeply feminist"" in her A- critique. ""It's Gerwig's care and attention to detail that gives Barbie an actual point of view, elevating it beyond every other cynical, IP-driven cash grab,"" she writes, adding, ""Turns out that life in plastic really can be fantastic."" Even before release, though, the film quickly captured the cultural zeitgeist, with leaked set photos and the trailer's infamous arched feet shot feeding the anticipation.
Of the fervor, Robbie, also a producer on the film, offers: ""I think Barbie's been capturing people's attention since the day she was invented. She is an icon but she's a very complicated one. There's been times when Barbie has been ahead of her times and there's been times when she's been behind her times, but she's always been evolving. I feel like this movie's the next evolution.""

2023-08-14 07:06:31+00:00,China Box Office: ‘No More Bets’ Beats ‘Barbie’ to World-Leading Weekend Haul,Chinese action title 'No More Bets' earned enough in the Middle Kingdom alone to be the top-grossing film in the world over the weekend.,"Chinese crime action movie “No More Bets,” not “Barbie,” was the best performing film in the world this weekend.
Comscore calculates that “No More Bets,” earned $88 million between Friday and Sunday in China alone. That figure is greater than the $33.7 million that “Barbie” earned in its fourth weekend of release in North America and the $45.1 million that it earned in international territories (for a global, weekend total of $78.8 million). “Barbie” now has a $1.18 billion global cumulative.
Comscore also has another Chinese-financed movie “Meg 2: The Trench” in third place worldwide over the weekend, with $12.7 million in North America and $43.7 million (for a weekend total of $56.4 million).
China box office data from Artisan Gateway, used by studio distributors as definitive rather than estimates, shows “No More Bets” performing even more strongly over the weekend. Artisan Gateway reports that “No More Bets” million earned $101 million (RMB718 million) in China for a total of $248 (RMB1.76 million) at the end of its first official week on release.
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” opened so ignominiously in China that Artisan Gateway did not include the figure in its top five. Local Chinese box office services report that it made $310,000 over its opening three days – enough for ninth place.
The Ning Hao-produced “film “No More Bets,” about a computer programmer and a model who go overseas and get themselves involved in a fraud scheme, was previously set to release on Wednesday (Aug. 9), an unusual mid-week opening compared to the standard Friday release date in China. But, at the last moment, its Dirty Monkey backers moved the date forward by a day to Tuesday. That’s because they had tasted success with a massive round of previews on the previous Saturday and Sunday that actually outswam “Meg 2’s” cinema debut.
Imax reports that “No More Bets” played on 652 of its giant screens in China and finished the weekend with an Imax sub-total of $6 million (including previews).
Ticketing agency Maoyan forecasts that “No More Bets” will earn $510 million (RMB3.7 billion) in its theatrical lifetime. It also reports a high spectator satisfaction score of 9.2 out of 10 as reported on its booking website and app. If achieved, that would put the film fractionally outside the all-time top ten in China.
Artisan Gateway shows fantasy epic “Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms” taking second place in China in its fourth weekend. It took $26.8 million, for a cumulative of $283 million since its July 20 debut. Imax reports that within that weekend score, the film earned $1.85 million on its screens. That give it an Imax cumulative in China of $28 million.
“Meg 2” slipped to third place over the weekend at the China box office. It earned $16.7 million for a total of $91 million after ten day. Maoyan is now forecasting a lifetime total in China of RMB892 million or $124 million) for the CMC Pictures and Warner Bros co-venture production.
Youth dance-drama film “One and Only” ranked fourth in China over the weekend with $6.6 million, for a three weekend total of $116 million.
Locally-made animation film “Chang An” brought up fifth place at the China box office over the weekend. It earned $4.9 million for a total of $242 million since opening on July 8.
The recent succession of strong summer weekends is helping China’s cinema box office defy the slowing economic background and recover to nearly pre-pandemic levels.
Nationwide weekend box office totaled $164 million, giving a year-to-date total of $5.51 billion. That is fully 72% ahead of the state-of-play at the same time last year and just 6% behind the equivalent point in 2019, according to Artisan Gateway calculations.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1uby1tb3JlLWJldHMtYmVhdHMtYmFyYmllLXdvcmxkLTEyMzU2OTUzOTUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW5vLW1vcmUtYmV0cy1iZWF0cy1iYXJiaWUtd29ybGQtMTIzNTY5NTM5NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

San Diego, California --News Direct-- forheraboutherbyher
Mallory Hoot’s irreverent take on modern dating has only been exasperated by the recently released Barbie movie in her article Swipe Left, Again: The Endless Carousel of Empty Promises and Dating Site Déjà Vu. Her hilarious take on dating in the 21st century has lead her to crazy experiences, including trying Swinger Sites, Swingers Apps, and risky Hookups.
She asked the Bing AI chatbot built on OpenAI’s ChatGPT LLM to review the Barbie movie. The results were predictable with missed inferences and misogynistic tendencies. Mallory asked is it really kenough? You be the judge.
The Barbie Movie, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie, is a refreshing and empowering take on the iconic doll and her world. The comedy follows Barbie as she leaves her perfect life in Malibu to explore the real world and find her true purpose. Along the way, she meets new friends, learns new skills, and faces new challenges. She also meets Ken, her love interest, who supports her dreams and encourages her growth.
The movie is a feminist manifesto for the 21st century, as it challenges the stereotypes and expectations society imposes on women and men. Barbie is not a passive or superficial character but a complex and dynamic one. She is not defined by her appearance or her relationship status but by her personality and her passions. She is not afraid to try new things, make mistakes, and learn from them. Her gender or her role does not limit her, but by her own choices and actions.
The movie also celebrates the diversity and individuality of each Barbie, as they come from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. The movie shows that there is no one right way to be a Barbie, or a woman, or a human being. The movie encourages each Barbie, and each viewer, to pursue their own dreams and passions, regardless of what others think or say.
Story continues
The movie also portrays Ken as a positive and progressive character, who respects and appreciates Barbie for who she is. He does not try to change her or control her, but to support her and encourage her. He does not feel threatened or intimidated by her independence or success, but proud and happy for her. He does not conform to the traditional masculine norms or roles, but expresses his own emotions and opinions.
The movie is a hilarious and heartfelt journey of self-discovery and empowerment for both Barbie and Ken, and for anyone who watches it. It is a movie that inspires us to be ourselves, to follow our hearts, and to live our lives to the fullest. It is a movie that reminds us that we are all beautiful, smart, successful, and happy in our own ways. It is a movie that redefines what it means to be a Barbie.

,Kuwait and Lebanon to ban Barbie over gender and sexuality,"Kuwait and Lebanon have moved to ban 'Barbie' in theaters, citing themes of gender and sexuality.","Barbie was set to cruise into the Middle East in her pink convertible this week, but the doll's hit some roadblocks en route to Kuwait and Lebanon.
Kuwait announced that Barbie has been banned late Wednesday, stating that the summer blockbuster from director Greta Gerwig promotes ""ideas and beliefs that are alien to the Kuwaiti society and public order,"" without further elaboration, per the Associated Press.
Authorities in Lebanon have also moved to ban the film after delaying its release to late August. Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada said it contradicts ""moral and religious values as well as the principles of Lebanon"" and ""promotes homosexuality and sexual transformation."" The movie also ""promotes sexual deviance and transsexuality,"" the minister said.

The bans come amid heightened anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric by politicians and officials in the country and surrounding regions in the Middle East, many of which consider homosexuality sinful. Hassan Nasrallah, leader of political party and militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, appeared to call for anti-gay violence last month, calling the LGBTQ+ community a ""threat to society"" and inciting harassment and death threats against the community.
Led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Barbie does not feature any overt sexuality, though the star-studded cast includes folks from the LGBTQ+ community, including Kate McKinnon, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and Scott Evans. The film recently crossed the $1 billion mark at the box office, making Gerwig the first solo female director to race past the threshold.
Another summer blockbuster, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, was similarly pulled from theaters across the Middle East last month, reportedly over a scene that included a poster featuring the transgender flag in the background.

2023-07-14 12:09:53+00:00,Mission: Impossible takes flight at box office … before Barbie and Oppenheimer join the party,"Early release for the latest Tom Cruise action film proves a shrewd move, amid talk of an eventful summer season","Just as actors are congregating on the picket line in Los Angeles for the first time in more than 40 years, audiences are flocking to the cinemas to see their films in unprecedented post-pandemic numbers.
Tom Cruise’s new film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has beaten its own franchise record this week, making $15.5m on its opening day of release, including $7m in the US; a million more than the sixth instalment managed over the same time period in 2018.
By releasing early in the week, Paramount’s blockbuster extends its “opening weekend” numbers over five days – a tactic also employed by some recent James Bond films to boost numbers. Predictions suggest Mission: Impossible’s final audience figures on Sunday will be around $95m in the US and $160m internationally.
Such numbers would mean the tentpole release would recoup much of its $290m budget before it’s been out for a week, and mean Cruise is likely to repeat last year’s trick of re-energising the Covid-battered box office. Top Gun: Maverick, his belated sequel to the 80s aviators hit, took $1.5bn in 2022 and was credited by many, including Steven Spielberg, with saving the cinematic experience.
Glowing reviews and energetic marketing – focusing on why the new film’s spectacular stunts are best seen on a big screen – are expected to help Cruise’s latest follow suit.
Such a strong start was, however, also enjoyed by the latest Indiana Jones film, which took $60m on its opening day two weeks ago ahead of a $130m opening weekend. Yet the film then sputtered and is currently on $250m – $50m shy of its budget.
Yet worse returns have been clocked for Pixar’s Elemental and DC superhero movie The Flash, both of which were held in high hopes by their studios.

The new Mission: Impossible has a week and a half to dominate cinemas before the double-headed threat of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both Greta Gerwig’s perky comedy and Christopher Nolan’s epic atomic-bomb drama are released worldwide on 21 July, and buzz around their battle has boosted pre-sales for both.
Cruise has professed enthusiasm rather than anxiety about the looming competition, declaring that he has bought tickets for Oppenheimer next Friday and Barbie the following day.
AMC cinemas in the US said that at least 20,000 of its members had booked to see both films on the same day, and many exhibitors globally are promoting the concept of this unlikely double bill.
Even without such smart marketing, both Barbie and Oppenheimer are being sold as “event cinema”. Barbie is billed as best seen en masse and, perhaps, after having visited the cinema’s licensed concession stand.

Oppenheimer, meanwhile, was shot on Imax, and as with many of Nolan’s films, audiences are strongly encouraged to see it on Imax screens – or, at least, the very largest possible. The film’s un-family friendly subject matter, as well as its R-rating in the US, may however limit its final takings. Tracking for Oppenheimer’s opening weekend currently stands as $43m in the US while Barbie’s is more than double, at $93m.
Bookmakers William Hill said on Friday that Barbie was 3/1 to become the highest-grossing film the year, with only The Super Mario Bros Movie (1/4) ahead of it in the betting.
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One was 10/1 with forthcoming superhero movie The Marvels down to 14/1.
Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 is also amongst the frontrunners at 10/1, with The Marvels (14/1) likewise in the reckoning. Dark horse Wonka came in at 33/1: the first trailer for Paul (Paddington) King’s origins story about Willy Wonka starring Timothée Chalamet was warmly received earlier this week.
Reviews for Barbie are embargoed until midnight BST on 18 July, with Oppenheimer at 5pm the following day.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL2p1bC8xNC9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtdGFrZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWF0LWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmVmb3JlLWJhcmJpZS1hbmQtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItam9pbi10aGUtcGFydHnSAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2ZpbG0vMjAyMy9qdWwvMTQvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXRha2VzLWZsaWdodC1hdC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJlZm9yZS1iYXJiaWUtYW5kLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWpvaW4tdGhlLXBhcnR5?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Barbie movie: How the marketing campaign has got everyone talking,Film critic Ali Plumb and a marketing expert explain why the Barbie film has been everywhere for months.,"Barbie movie: How the marketing campaign has got everyone talking
By Bonnie McLaren BBC Newsbeat
Warner Bros. Pictures
It feels like everyone's been living in a Barbie world thanks to the film's massive marketing campaign
Come on Barbie, let's go party.
After months of build-up on social media, the Barbie movie is finally released next week.
Fans are planning bottomless brunches and parties for 21 July, and over the past week Margot Robbie has been gracing global premieres in outfits inspired by real-life Barbie dolls.
The film contains some of the world's most famous actors - Ryan Gosling, Helen Mirren, Issa Rae and the new Doctor Who, Ncuti Gatwa.
And if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack has been produced by Mark Ronson and includes tracks from the likes of Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, and Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice who've combined to sample the original Barbie Girl by Aqua.
But if you feel like you've been invited along to the Barbie party, then it hasn't happened by accident.
Because it's not just the stellar cast, soundtrack or reviews that have got people talking - the film's marketing campaign has also been huge.

Pink billboards - which only contain the film's release date - have appeared in cities worldwide and a pink Barbie DreamHouse even appeared in Malibu, which superfans could rent on Airbnb.
And the Barbie party also swept into London this week for the film's premiere on Wednesday.
Barbican tube station was renamed Barbiecan and a pink Tardis also appeared at Tower Bridge.
And that's not to mention the hundreds of licensing tie-ins - from shoes to clothing collections to Barbie Xbox controllers.
So if you feel like you've been seeing Barbie everywhere, you're not imagining things.

For BBC Radio 1's film critic Ali Plumb, the film's campaign has been everywhere because Mattel - which owns the Barbie brand - are selling more than just a movie.
""What you're seeing isn't just a promotion for the film,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat.
""It's for the Barbie brand, for everything pink and the colour.
""So you might think, hang on this marketing is all over the place. And it's doing so well, I'm seeing it everywhere.""
Another thing Ali thinks has helped the film are the posters, which people could edit themselves into and ""encouraged a lot of people to make their own"".
He says Barbie's marketing campaign is a stark contrast to Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which is released on the same day.
And while lots of people are planning to watch both on 21 July - in what's been dubbed Barbenheimer - Ali says Oppenheimer has taken a more traditional approach.
""That's a movie about the man who helped create the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb,"" he says.
""So you can't sell toys off the back of that, you can't sell fishing rods and shirts and hats and whatever random stuff they might be selling - it's just the movie.""
Getty Images
People were even talking about the film in June 2022 when Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were snapped filming scenes
Moshe Isaacian is a senior brand consultant who compiled a viral Twitter thread listing many of the Barbie marketing stunts and licensing deals.
And if the campaign has felt like it's been going on for ages, he says the planning has been years in the works.
Moshe, who's worked with Nike and Amazon, says many of the deals have been ""a year, two years in the making"" and that Mattel have been ""very good at being selective"".
""It doesn't just feel like the regular licensing deals,"" he says.
""It's more like [they're selling] Barbie's lifestyle plan now - like this is how Barbie would dress up, talk, the things she would eat, what kind of candles she would have in her house.
""These are things that mostly an older generation care about.""
Ali also thinks the film has an older, and wider, appeal than the audience the dolls are marketed at - partly because it's being directed by Little Women's Greta Gerwig.
In one teaser clip, Barbie asks her fellow dolls if they ever think about dying, and Ken asks Barbie if he can stay round her house - much to Barbie's bemusement.
""It doesn't feel to me like children will be watching a children's film. In fact, and this is just a guess, I suspect young children will be bamboozled by it.""
In contrast to the marketing side of things, there's also been a level of secrecy around the actual film itself.
BBC News hasn't been able to watch it yet but the few reviews that are out there are largely positive.
So, after months of build-up - is the expensive advertising campaign going to pay off?
""I think the opening weekend for Barbie is going to be huge even if it ends up being badly reviewed, and I don't think it will be,"" Ali says.
""The excitement is at such fever pitch that it's guaranteed I think to have people in cinemas watching it, if only to see the big names.
""But also so they have their own thoughts on the thing that will be the discussion topic in pop culture for the summer.""

,Review: The Barbie-Oppenheimer double feature,"Two vastly different movies premiered this past weekend, generating laughter, tears and a critical view of the United States’ past.","The premieres of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” July 21 have brought audiences back to the movie theater in record numbers, with many seeing both films on the same day.
In what is being called “Barbenheimer,” the double-feature of these two films spans genre and theme, yet both films critique the United States’ past and turn an eye toward the future.
“Oppenheimer”
Directed by Christopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer” tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist hired by the United States government to lead the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.
The movie, based on the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” covers Oppenheimer’s schooling, all of his time constructing the atomic bomb and a hearing with the U.S. government which later stripped him of his job title.
Appointed by Lt. Leslie Groves to run the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer and Groves selected the best scientists they could find to move to Los Alamos, New Mexico for the construction of the bomb.
It is three hours long and a marathon of a film. However, it never dragged on. Flashing back and forth, the movie carefully revealed more details from different phases of his life.
Cillian Murphy gave an incredible performance, perfectly portraying the complicated decisions of a haunted man. He rides the line between womanizer, communist sympathizer and curious scientist extremely well.
One stand-out element of this movie is the editing. Throughout the film, chilling images and sounds were spliced alongside the excitement of the American people at the use of the first atomic bomb, portraying the significance of the act.
At one point in the film, after the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima, Oppenheimer gives a speech to the families at Los Alamos, the site of the bomb’s construction.
All at once during his speech, no sound emanated from the screen. The wide-mouth smiles of the flag-waving crowd, the clapping and the cheering went silent. Oppenheimer, haunted by his actions, is seen stepping inside the disintegrating corpse of a victim of the bomb. Another woman’s face in the audience appeared to flake off as she cheered.
Due to his past communist affiliations, after World War II ended and the Cold War began, Oppenheimer lost his security clearance and therefore his job with the U.S. government.
The movie ended with a grim look toward the future. A notion that although the bomb did not immediately ignite the atmosphere and end life as we know it –– as some feared it would –– the bomb and its creators may still have brought the end of civilization.
“Barbie”
Directed by Greta Gerwig, “Barbie” follows the story of a stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) and her Ken (Ryan Gosling) as they venture into the real world and discover it is not as perfect as they thought.
Based on the brand Mattel’s Barbie, the story plays out like a little girl playing with dolls. The Barbies float down to the street from their houses as if imaginary hands were in control. The shower in the Barbie mansion rains imaginary water and, every morning, Barbie drinks imaginary coffee.
This movie is a love letter to little girls and the inner-child women often abandon as they grow up. Whether it’s the government, the doctor’s office or the beach volleyball courts, in Barbieland, women run things.
As Barbie and Ken venture into the real world, one they believe to have been made completely similar to Barbieland, they meet a rude awakening. While Barbie experiences sexual assault and a pointed confrontation about her negative impact on women’s body image from a teenage girl, Ken enjoys the newfound respect he didn’t have in Barbieland.
The movie addresses both men’s and women’s fights for power and how new information can snap someone out of their preconceived notions.
With a PG-13 rating for suggestive references and brief language, the movie is kid-friendly. At many moments, the story is told how a child playing with dolls would tell a story, glossing over the business-like serious words and inserting a massive dance number.
The most important thing to know about “Barbie” is that it is hilarious. The jokes just kept on coming. If you ever played with Barbies as a child or if you never got the chance, this movie is 114 minutes of child-like joy.
Ending in a feel-good dance number and a reunion of the Barbies and the Kens, the future of Barbieland remains unknown. However, it appears the Kens will work towards gaining all of the rights women have in the real world.
Recap
Both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” deserve the attention they have received in theaters. This weekend, two drastically different movies achieved cinematic excellence in their own ways.
Barbenheimer weekend brought people to theaters, becoming the fourth biggest domestic box office weekend in the United States by grossing $311 million, according to The New York Times.
Cillian Murphy said it best in an interview with IGN Entertainment when describing the Barbenheimer premier:
“I think it’s just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out on the same day. You can spend the whole day in the cinema, what’s better than that?” Murphy said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbW5kYWlseS5jb20vMjc4MTU3L2FydHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9yZXZpZXctdGhlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1kb3VibGUtZmVhdHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-25 09:00:33+00:00,Susan Faludi Thinks ‘Barbie’ Is a Delight. She Also Thinks It’s About Abortion. - The New York Times,The author of “Backlash” thinks Greta Gerwig’s film is more than a delight.,"Susan Faludi suggested we show up to the “Barbie” movie in a pink Corvette, but unfortunately, the only car available was a pickup truck. So that was how one of the world’s leading feminists and I showed up to her local mall: in a 2002 black Toyota Tacoma, with tickets to Auditorium 2 for “Barbie.”
I’d asked Ms. Faludi, the Pulitzer-winning journalist and author — whose 1991 book, “Backlash,” became an instant classic — to see this summer’s most joyful and lucrative blockbuster with me because I was hoping she might help me make sense of its morass of hot pink contradictions.
There are few toys quite so confounding as Barbie. Even her origin story: She was based on a sex doll for men, but somehow marketed to mothers for their daughters. Barbie has been a protest slogan (“I am not your Barbie”), a bimbo (remember “Math class is tough” Barbie?), an eating disorder accelerant. In one particularly clever protest against the doll, she had her voice box swapped with G.I. Joe’s, so suddenly she said, “Vengeance is mine!” and he said, “The beach is the place for summer.” But Barbie has also been a lawyer, a pilot, an astronaut and the president. She has never married, lives alone and does not have children.
The movie seemed as full of contradictions as the doll. It was promoted through a marketing campaign that had more licensing deals than Barbie has outfits: There were Barbie clothes and Barbie makeup and ice cream and vacation packages and a takeover of the Google home page, which is currently filling my screen with pink explosions every time I try to fact-check this essay. But it also had a director — Greta Gerwig — with indie street cred, and early reviews focused on the film’s subversiveness. Ms. Gerwig, it seemed, had managed to make Barbie satisfyingly self-aware, likable and mockable; she called out the hypocrisy of the manufacturer — Mattel — while getting its blessing on the project. And then, somehow, she — and the company — marketed it all back to us.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjUvb3Bpbmlvbi9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtZmFsdWRpLWZlbWluaXNtLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

As reflected in Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster movie that tackles the legacy Mattel’s famous doll, Barbie has always been more popular than Ken. For every Ken doll sold today, there’s generally eight to 10 Barbies sold, according to Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of review site of TTPM.

It’s unclear if Warner Bros’ “Barbie,” which was also co-produced by Mattel, will increase Ken production and sales. But Silver noted that the movie “gave Ken more attention than Ken has received” in decades.
Ken was first introduced back in 1961, two years after Barbie hit store shelves. But he hasn’t had nearly the same impact on the Barbieverse since.

“Barbie’s world is about Barbie. And (to some), Ken may be an accessory of sorts,” said Ed Timke, an assistant professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University, pointing to years of marketing that has, naturally, put Barbie at center stage.
The new attention around Ken following “Barbie’s” release has also received pushback. Many note that the movie is about Barbie — not Ken — and that’s where the spotlight should stay.
Still, the dynamic between the film’s Barbie and Ken may get people to reflect some big questions about gender as well as Ken’s own evolution over the years.
Who is Ken as a toy and how has he changed?
Ken’s relationship to Barbie has been up for debate since the two hit the toy aisle together. While Mattel long-advertised Ken as Barbie’s boyfriend — and even detailed their 2004 split and subsequent reconciliation seven years later — many also saw Ken as Barbie’s best friend, and sometimes queer icon. One 1993 version of Ken in particular, Earring Magic Ken, became notably popular among LGBTQ consumers, the New York Historical Society notes. At the time, Mattel denied the Earring Magic Ken was queer and later pulled him from shelves.
Other popular versions of Ken ranged from the tuxedo-wearing 1984 Dream Date Ken, to 1978 Superstar Ken and 1979 Sun Malibu Ken, which became one of the doll’s most iconic looks (as reflected in Ryan Gosling’s character). While Ken has gone through far fewer career changes than Barbie, his resume boasts job titles like astronaut, barista, country western singer and doctor.
“A wonderful thing is that through play, children are free to have their dolls take on any type of role that they wish,” said Ann Herzog, a clinical instructor of child life and family-centered care at Boston University.
She also underlined the importance of diversity in toy collections and providing “open-ended play opportunities and not to endorse stereotypes that the Barbie collection and dolls in general are only specific to a particular gender.”

While children of all genders, including young boys, have played with Barbie and Ken over the years, Timke notes that “there’s definitely the gendering of marketing toward girls” for both figures, pointing to contrasts in advertising for products historically seen as “boy toys,” such as G.I. Joe. That legacy, as well as other socialization, still impacts who plays with certain toys today.
Still, Ken — like Barbie — has evolved over time and become more diverse, particularly after Mattel rolled out more skin tones, body types, hairstyles and more for Ken dolls in 2017. Some Kens also have prosthetic legs, wheelchairs and hearing aids. Increases in diverse representation — with similar changes seen since 2016 for Barbie — has boosted the dolls’ popularity and comeback sales, Silver said.
Will Barbie (and Ken) sales increase following the movie’s release?
Mattel did not respond to The Associated Press’ requests for data or comment on specific Ken and Barbie sales seen before and after “Barbie’s” July 21 release. But according to market research firm Circana, Barbie sales overall for the U.S. toy industry increased 40% in the last two weeks of July compared with the same period in 2022.
Circana doesn’t break out Ken from Barbie sales. Still, “I suspect that, with the movie, sales of Ken dolls will experience a strong lift in sales,” Juli Lennett, VP, U.S. toys industry advisor at Circana, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Additional experts also expected a spike in interest, but weren’t sure about the long run.
Lennett did note that the top-selling “Barbie” movie item for those last two weeks of July was the Barbie Gingham Dress followed by the Ken Doll Set. Between those two items, Barbie outsold Ken nearly two to one, she said.

For the second quarter of 2023, which ended weeks before the movie’s release, worldwide sales of Barbie to retailers excluding adjustments actually fell 6%. Mattel executives told analysts that sales had improved in July, and it expects the movie will have a halo effect on the brand for years to come.
There was a carryover of inventory across the toy industry for the first half of the year, Silver explains, noting that record sales in the first years of the pandemic led to over-buying at the end of 2022. He predicts a rebound in Barbie sales heading into the holiday season, when toy spending is high and after “Barbie” eventually makes its way to streaming.
And of course, sales following “Barbie’s” release won’t be limited to the toy aisle. Other branded products are also gaining popularity from the film, including Ken-focused swag like “I am Kenough” sweatshirts and other “Ken-ergy” apparel, are currently for sale by Mattel, as well as from third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMvY3QtYXVkLW53LWJhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1rZW4tcG9wdWxhcml0eS0yMDIzMDgxMi01c2k2dXRqeGd2YTV6bHd3Zm1qNXBrb2YzNC1zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Haunted Mansion movie review & film summary (2023),"With a repeated sourness in the film’s comedic efforts and a tragically misused ensemble, Haunted Mansion misses the chance to become a Halloween classic.","“Haunted Mansion” is star-studded but shoddy at best. Despite the talent of writer Katie Dippold (“The Heat” “Parks and Recreation”), the script’s punchlines are forced and flat. Everyone is doled their share of one-liners, but Wilson and Haddish carry most of the weight. While Wilson often runs dry, Haddish delivers in her classic tone and cadence, executing flimsy jokes to her best ability. The script does toe the line of Disney’s boundaries, tossing in some light innuendos in a somewhat concerted effort to draw in more mature audiences.
Simien's film does display its fun-loving origins in how the house can transform into a surrealist landscape. Halls that never end, ceilings that extend into impossibility, gargoyles, hidden rooms, and the ever-so-classic ghost-inhabited portraits recall nostalgia for the film’s classic Gothicism. “Haunted Mansion” boasts a handful of playful chases and spooky sequences, but they’re fleeting and soon bring us back to the film’s stuttering pace. It's hard to find any true tension in ""Haunted Mansion"" until the climactic faceoff in the third act.
Perhaps the greatest letdown of Simien's movie is how little the cast delivers. The ensemble is brimming with lively, prolific candidates, yet the script hardly seems to keep this in mind. Their talents are either underused or misdirected. Stanfield’s Ben mourns the loss of his wife, his grief becoming a cornerstone of the story. Yet while we’ve seen Stanfield display emotional depth in other roles, every tearful moment feels like a soap opera, not on account of sentiment, but performance. There’s a sense of watered-down contrivance across the board. The forced, postured will-they won’t-they romance between Stanfield and Dawson showcases this also. And with seasoned comedic actors in Wilson, DeVito, and Haddish, too few of their comedy efforts actually hit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvaGF1bnRlZC1tYW5zaW9uLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Parmar walked out of the theater with her 10-year-old daughter within minutes of the film starting. Other parents also left with their children.","Greta Gerwig's new Barbie movie may be receiving rave reviews from around the world but it has certainly struck the wrong note for actor Juhi Parmar. The Kumkum star took to Instagram with a lengthy note on Monday, calling out the ‘inappropriate’ film for its seemingly adult themes. The well known TV actor said that she had walked out of the theatre within mere minutes after going to watch the movie with her 10-year-old daughter.
While Parmar acknowledged that she had not noticed the film was rated PG-13, she added that ""the language and content is inappropriate even for children 13 and above"".
“10 minutes into the movie, inappropriate language, sexual connotations and I was anxiously running out of the theater wondering what had I just exposed my child to. She had been waiting to watch your film and here I was just shocked, disappointed and heartbroken with what I had just exposed her to. I was the first one to walk out of the movie within 10-15 minutes and by the time I reached out, I saw other parents following with their little ones crying, while some parents chose to stay back to watch the entire movie,"" she wrote.
The remarks have not gone down well with netizens, many of whom urged Parmar to “maybe try watching the entire thing"" before forming an opinion.
“In your entire post you give no example of what was even inappropriate in the movie. The reason it's PG-13 is because Barbie is a functioning adult and the movie has themes deeper than a child could ever understand. The only reason you're pissed is because they showed Barbie as an actual woman and not just the perfect idea you've been feeding your kids. If you watched the entire thing (with or without your kid) you would have been able to write a more intellectual review than whatever this post is,"" read one irate comment.
I guess you need to understand that this movie is not adult because of why you have mentioned but because it talks about deeper themes like existential crisis, mental health, and patriarchy which might be too heavy for children to understand,"" wrote another.
“Please do not bad mouth such a beautifully made movie just because you didn’t do your research properly and mistook it to be some Disney movie,"" added another comment.
“It's not the films job to parent your child. Read the ratings and take a call. Sensitive much? Barbie has always been sexualised, where have you been?"" wrote another individual.

,Strays movie review & film summary (2023),"The gross-out gags may grow a bit repetitive, but Strays ultimately redeems itself by ending on a note that’s feel-good without being cloying.","Director Josh Greenbaum has shown a flair for out-there comedy with a sweetness at its core in the delightfully bizarre “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar” (2021). He achieves a similar balance with raunchier material in “Strays.” Besides featuring a ton of profanity, the screenplay from Dan Perrault includes plenty of poop and pee jokes (not all of which are entirely puerile), vigorous humping, and some wilderness mayhem that some may find shocking. But the film also explores the importance of identifying and escaping toxic relationships, achieving a sense of self-worth, and basking in the support of deep and unexpected friendships.
I may have teared up a few times. Like I said at the start, a soft touch. Your mileage may vary on this canine road trip.
“Strays” begins on an upbeat note with narration from Ferrell as Reggie, an adorably scruffy Border terrier who’s clueless to the fact that his miserable, abusive owner (Will Forte) hates him and keeps trying to abandon him. “Today is going to be the best day ever!” he intones in a sunny manner reminiscent of Margot Robbie’s optimism at the start of “Barbie.” And totally coincidentally, “Strays” shares a similar structure to Greta Gerwig’s mega-blockbuster: Idealistic character leaves home, goes to the “real world,” makes friends, and learns hard truths before returning to fix things with the newfound knowledge. Only in this case, the protagonist’s purpose is literally to bite off his owner’s penis, a more violent form of eviscerating the patriarchy than Barbie ever could imagine. Ferrell is essentially doing a version of his character in “Elf” here, mixing wide-eyed enthusiasm with deadpan observations and bringing his signature sincerity to a silly role. As always, he’s a hoot.
After his owner dumps him in a faraway city, Reggie gets help in his quest from the trash-talking Bug, who insists he wants to be a stray and navigates the world with the swagger of a little dog who thinks he’s big. Foxx has fantastic energy here, savoring the musicality of his character’s every profane tirade. Along for the trip are the Australian shepherd Maggie (Isla Fisher), a gifted sniffer, and a Great Dane named Hunter (Randall Park), a former police K-9 who now works as a therapy dog for the elderly.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3Mvc3RyYXlzLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The other tells the origin story of the deadliest weapon in human history.
On July 21, with the opening of two of the most anticipated films of the year, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” thousands of fans will head to theaters to watch both movies on the same day — relishing the irony of seeing two star-studded films with such incongruous themes.

2023-08-18 05:00:34+00:00,“Barbie” review: How a metaphysical matriarchy aggrieved a petulant patriarchy,"Greta Gerwig makes history as the first female director to have a billion dollar film in the box office with ""Barbie"".","Courtesy of The Movie Database
In spite of being long overdue, Greta Gerwig has become the first female director with a billion-dollar film under her belt.
“Barbie” has been the highlight of the summer, drawing discourse from far-right and leftist media platforms alike. While some claim it was “anti-man” feminist propaganda, others believe it was an existentialist commentary on the transition from girlhood to womanhood. I can wholeheartedly say that I’m in complete agreement with the latter viewpoint.
Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her pristine day-to-day life in Barbieland with Ken (Ryan Gosling) and a myriad of other Barbie and Ken variants. From one day to the next, Barbie develops an awakening desire for purpose and self-fulfillment. She makes a visit to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), who informs her that she must visit the real world in order to uncover the truth she seeks.
Even though I went in with a preconceived notion of the film’s excellence based on Gerwig’s previous work, “Barbie” exceeded my expectations in every way. Gerwig’s ability to weave and intertwine elements of the human experience through the lens of female autonomy never ceases to amaze me. Gerwig presented audiences with a light hearted, sentimental depiction of what it is to be a woman and how inherent societal structures and ideologies often limit us.
Nonetheless, “Barbie” received backlash for all sorts of reasons. Primarily for its feminist themes and commentary on patriarchy. However, it seems those who were vexed by this film lack a fair amount of media literacy.
“Barbie” turns the table in terms of narrative and in regard to gender roles throughout the history of cinema. “Women in Refrigerators” is a trope that was generated by writer Simone Gail which places emphasis on the recurrence of female characters being portrayed as assets to their male counterparts. A student writer for the Women’s Center worded it best; “Utilizing female characters as assets to their male counterparts contributes to the sexism women are subjected to their entire lives. Young girls or women who consume this media get the impression that they are only a mere accessory to the plot rather than an influential factor in the story.”
All “Barbie” did was flip the script, yet men with fragile masculinity still managed to be upset with the film and its premise. Imagine how tired we are, as women, who have been complacent and have kept silent for decades when we’re depicted as nothing more than a looming shadow, a supporting character.
Ken stands as a metaphor that patriarchy fails to uplift men and women all the same. While it’s more transparent as to how it affects women, it’s still dismissive of men by subconsciously insinuating that boys don’t need a doll to show them that they can be astronauts, doctors, politicians, authors, and so on. They have historical figures, status quo, and the upper hand in one of the world’s most dominant countries. For over three centuries, the head of the country has been a male. Not once has a woman been granted this utmost position of power.
The issue is that most men rather be perceived as immoral than subsidiary, and that is the poison that the patriarchy has perpetuated since the beginning of time. As the saying goes, “when you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression”.
All in all, “Barbie” was a candy-colored masterpiece with a stellar cast, phenomenal writing, and an intricate narrative that appeals to audiences of all ages. There’s talk of a sequel and I couldn’t be more delighted to see what Gerwig makes of it.
“Barbie” is now playing in theaters.

2023-07-23 19:34:27+00:00,"The Real Meaning of ‘Barbenheimer’: If You Build Exciting Movies, They Will Come","""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer,"" in vastly different ways, are both reminders that we go to the movies to be in the grip of an artist.","When the history of movies in the age of streaming, COVID and the first double strike since 1960 is written, the day of July 21, 2023, will go down as the rare date that’s actually remembered as a box-office landmark. For that was the day that Hollywood dropped two blockbuster weapons — one pink, the other dark — both of which hit their target audiences and went boom.
A downside of our franchise culture is that even when movies become big hits, their appeal often boils down to a basic expression of mass taste engineered by market forces. Look, the “Jurassic Park” concept worked again. Shocking! The “Mission: Impossible” series has a wild card tucked into its gamesmanship (you’re not going to get AI to do what Tom Cruise does on a motorcycle), but once you look past Cruise’s stunt mojo, even the perfectly decent new “M:I” installment has been greeted by critics as “the best action film of the summer.” That made me think: Aren’t the “Mission: Impossible” movies supposed to be more than action films? We’ve got “Fast XXV: Fuel-Injected Diesel” for that.
Which brings me to those pink and dark hit weapons. You could say that “Barbie,” by tapping into the appeal of the most famous doll of the 20th century, takes off from as iron-clad a piece of IP as any movie ever has. You could say, “Okay, great, it made $155 million in three days — but a Barbie movie was always going to have a built-in audience.” Except that imagine if “Barbie” had been made in a standard way, by a standard filmmaker; it could easily have been a “Smurf” movie with better clothes. “Barbie” may be legendary IP, but the idea of a movie about Barbie, Ken and all their friends is not exactly a concept that lends itself to human dimensions (or to entertaining qualities as a movie for anyone over the age of 12).
For that, you need a filmmaker like Greta Gerwig, who summoned the industry power and the pop vision to transform “Barbie” into an exuberant jokey carnival of fourth-wall-breaking doll’s-house-as-rabbit-hole feminist surrealism — a candy-colored Dreamhouse burlesque that adores Barbie and resents her at the same time, that tweaks the patriarchy even as it treats Ken as the film’s most complicated character, and that has the wit to recognize that Barbie isn’t just a plaything, she’s a metaphysical projection of feminine ideals who also has the effect of undermining who women are.
Greta Gerwig, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz and Margot Robbie on the “Barbie” set Jaap Buitendijk
That’s a lot to unpack in a movie about a doll, but here’s the point: Did Greta Gerwig simply sneak all that stuff into a Mattel movie that can still function perfectly well as a piece of product that’s moving even more product off the shelves? Or did her playful subversive sensibility take a movie that was probably destined to be successful and turn it into something twice as successful? The buzz leading up to the release of “Barbie” was off the hook. I haven’t felt that level of anticipation since the era when the thrill wasn’t yet gone from “Star Wars” movies. And I’d argue that even though most of the people eager to see the film may not have known, going in, who Greta Gerwig was (though they will now), they picked up on what the Greta Gerwig-ness of the whole enterprise meant: that this was not going to be a cookie-cutter Barbie movie, that it was going to be a bowl of very spiked punch. It was going to be a movie that surprised you. It’s that essential quality, not just the IP, that could make “Barbie” the biggest movie of 2023.
As an act of counterprogramming, the simultaneous release of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” plays like someone’s idea of a cosmic joke. It’s not just that the two films make a perfect pair in their staggering lack of aesthetic and demographic overlap. It’s that glommed together into the greater-than-the-sum-of-the-parts entity known as “Barbenheimer,” the two movies seem to express the yin and yang of the 21st-century world. As a culture, we’re as serious as the atom bomb and as superficial as Barbie — and we take our superficial playthings deadly seriously. If the box-office triumph of “Barbie” sends a crucial signal that inviting a gifted filmmaker to revel in the power of her idiosyncrasy works as a commercial proposition, the box-office triumph of “Oppenheimer” sends a different signal, reminding us that we still live in a heady and sober culture, one in which a three-hour talkfest meditation on the meaning of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atom bomb, can seize audiences the way the movies of the ’70s or ’90s used to.
Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan on the set of “Oppenheimer” Melinda Sue Gordon
Christopher Nolan is certainly a director with a built-in fan base. But it’s worth noting what the Nolan brand represents: filmmaking as an adventure into the unknown, as a movie you go to a theater to watch, as an experience that’s larger than life, that’s vastly bigger than you. The promise of “Oppenheimer,” and what I think is luring people out to see it in even greater numbers than expected, is that the film won’t just be a biopic about the man who spearheaded the creation of nuclear weapons. It will be a movie about all of us, about what the creation of nuclear weapons did to us. That’s one reason you want to see “Oppenheimer” with an audience. IMAX, if you experience the film in that form, means a big screen, but the ultimate big screen is the collective consciousness of everyone in the theater.
These two movies, with nothing in common except the power and passion that got each of them made, have arrived at the perfect moment in our perfect storm of entertainment-industry meltdown. Long after their theatrical runs are over, “Barbenheimer” will stand as a touchstone that can remind everyone why we go to the movies: not just to relive some old IP but to dive into a vision, to live life for two hours (or maybe three) in the grip of an artist. There’s a lesson here, apart from buzzy fireworks of success, that the industry needs to remember and embrace. The lesson is that all of this works only when we give artists the license to follow their muse, to express the excitement of what’s in their soul. Everything else is just algorithms.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2NvbHVtbnMvYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLWxlc3NvbnMtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi0xMjM1Njc3ODAxL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2NvbHVtbnMvYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLWxlc3NvbnMtYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ub2xhbi0xMjM1Njc3ODAxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Mattel unveils new doll based on Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie,"Mattel has a new Weird Barbie doll, modeled after Kate McKinnon's breakout character from Greta Gerwig's blockbuster film, available for preorder.","""I had a Weird Barbie!"" Gloria (America Ferrera) exclaims in the final act of Greta Gerwig's Barbie film upon meeting Kate McKinnon's disfigured doll.
""Yeah, you did,"" Weird Barbie replies knowingly.
If you ever missed out on that experience, fear not: Now you too can have your own Weird Barbie! On Friday, Mattel unveiled a new doll in the likeness of McKinnon's character — complete with facial markings, a mismatched outfit, and legs that can do the splits.

As impressive as Weird Barbie's splits are, McKinnon admitted during EW's Around the Table chat with the Barbie cast (which you can watch above) that she didn't actually perform those physical feats herself. Instead, the effect was achieved through ingenius tinkering by production designer Sarah Greenwood.
""Sarah who did the set design was like, 'I've made all these holes in the wall where she can put her real leg in, and then we'll rig the other leg up,'"" Gerwig said. ""It was like a practical effect.""
The effect is so convincing that Ferrera didn't realize the machinations until she participated in EW's roundtable discussion.
""Every single person asked if that was your leg, and so the way that you sold that, you should be proud,"" President Barbie herself, Issa Rae, told McKinnon.
Behold Mattel's new Weird Barbie doll. Mattel
Mattel's made-to-order Weird Barbie is now available for preorder until Aug. 18. According to Mattel, they're expected to ship on or before May 31, 2024.
These interviews were conducted prior to the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike.

2023-07-28 11:00:20+00:00,The Dance Delight in ‘Barbie’ Belongs to the Kens,"The most majestic dance in “Barbie” is an emotional release for the Kens, but in subtle ways movement touches, and enhances, everything in the movie.","There’s a gorgeous scene in “Barbie” that isn’t painted the usual pink. It isn’t dripping in plastic or sequins. It’s a dream ballet, stylish and clean, with steps so sleek it lets bodies — Kens, Kens and more Kens — sing.
Unofficially known as the Ken dance, it’s like entering a portal to another world, where moving bodies etch trails of rotating circles and diamonds onto a gleaming surface. It transports you back to the time of Busby Berkeley, when elegant dancers swirled in and out of kaleidoscopic formations.
But the jazzy gist of the “I’m Just Ken” dance isn’t just about staggering patterns or nostalgia for old Hollywood. Plopped into Greta Gerwig’s Barbie universe, the dance is more than a dance: It’s an emotional release. With five leading Kens in front and a sweeping chorus of dancers shuttling behind and around them, the choreography is a passionate expression of selfhood, a tonic that recalls the vitality and athletic grace of Gene Kelly.
It’s odd: In the first half of the film, Margot Robbie, as the lead, Stereotypical Barbie, operates from a body that is restrained — she’s clunky. This makes sense. She lacks joints! But as the film progresses, an everyday movement vocabulary takes over. Barbie glides into a modern, pedestrian body while the men, wooden at first, learn to move expansively. They let go.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjgvYXJ0cy9kYW5jZS9rZW4tZGFuY2UtYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Is The Critique of Consumerism Dead? ❧ Current Affairs,"<p>Today’s left seems less inclined to critique advertising, consumerism, and pop culture. Should we be more skeptical?</p>","The new Barbie movie is, of course, a giant infomercial. It is other things, too—a feminist satire, an homage to Gene Kelly musicals, a carnival of “wokeness” that seems to have been written specifically to irritate Ben Shapiro, etc. But as the Wall Street Journal reports, toy manufacturer Mattel is depending on the film to increase sales of Barbies. The company “needs moviegoers to pick up dolls and Dreamhouses to boost its fortunes” after a recent slump in profits.
The Barbie marketing blitz has been intense. Mattel has launched tie-ins with over 100 other brands. In some deals “a brand pays Mattel a flat licensing fee, while others will give Mattel a five to fifteen percent cut of sales.”
At the mall, there are Barbie and Ken T-shirts from the Gap and pink gingham Barbie cardigans at Hot Topic. Neiman Marcus will sell pink Barbie handbags from Balmain, and at Bloomingdale’s there will be life-size Barbie DreamHouse installations. Ulta Beauty has hot-pink Barbie electric toothbrushes. Target and Amazon have Barbie pool floats. Microsoft made a Barbie Xbox.
This is just the beginning. There is the traveling World of Barbie exhibition, the special Barbie Crocs (currently sold out), and partnerships with General Motors, Progressive Insurance, and Google. The entire front window display at Bloomingdale’s in New York is a giant Barbie dreamhouse installation. More products are popping up every day. (“You, Too, Can Be ‘Kenough’ with a Sweatshirt Just Like Ryan Gosling’s in ‘Barbie’”)
It has been called the “marketing campaign of the year,” and has been estimated to cost $150 million, more than the film’s entire production budget. The president of Warner Brothers’ marketing department says that at a certain point, it “stopped becoming a marketing campaign and took on the quality of a movement.” The ubiquity of Barbie marketing inspired jokes every time something pink popped up in nature—the Barbie marketing team must be at it again.
It all paid off spectacularly for Mattel. The company’s stock prices are up 20 percent. The movie “had the biggest domestic opening of any movie released this year” and “generated more than $356.3 million in worldwide box-office sales in its opening weekend.” Mattel, the Journal tells us, saw the success rival toymakers Hasbro and Lego had with film franchises, and “now has 14 other live-action movies in the works, including one about Hot Wheels, the game card Uno and the purple dinosaur Barney.” Lena Dunham is set to direct a “Polly Pocket” movie for Mattel. It now “sees the growth opportunity in these franchise deals as ‘exponential.’”
But perhaps the most surprising thing about all of this is that the Barbie movie itself has received rave reviews. The critical consensus is that it’s “hysterically funny, perfectly cast, and affectionately crafted,” a “thoughtfully self-aware, laugh-out-loud comedy that benefits from a flawless Margot Robbie and a scene-stealing Ryan Gosling.” They’re not wrong. I saw the movie the day after it opened (I am drawn to hot pink like a moth to a lantern). It truly has something for everyone. (Except Shapiro.) For example, I happen to be a huge fan of the 1940s British movies of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and as director Greta Gerwig has explained, she includes explicit visual tributes to those movies in Barbie.
The choice of Gerwig was a masterstroke by Mattel, and something of a risk. She’s an auteur filmmaker who is too thoughtful and creative to make a predictable Barbie movie. Barbie is a Movie of Ideas, a meditation on gender relations and patriarchy and beauty standards that incorporates the longstanding feminist critique of Barbie dolls (“You’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented!”), while staying fun and colorful and weird. Even socialist magazine Jacobin’s reviewer had to concede that while “it’s ultimately another grotesque, high-profile, yay-for-capitalism intellectual property movie celebrating successful products like Air, Tetris, BlackBerry, and Flamin’ Hot (Cheetos),” “it’s amazing that the film manages to be as good as it is.”
Right-wingers are losing their minds over the “wokeness” of the Barbie movie, and it’s true that it is “progressive” on race and gender, in the sense that the population of the fictional Barbieland is diverse (the president of Barbieland is a Black woman) and Barbie has lines like “Giving a voice to the cognitive dissonance required to being a woman under the patriarchy robbed it of its power.” But as leftists often point out, “neoliberal” feminism often pays close attention to questions around representation (e.g., the gender demographics of corporate boards) while all but ignoring issues of class. That’s certainly true in the Barbie movie. When Barbie goes from Barbieland to the “real world,” she runs into a lot of problems that didn’t exist in the Girl Power utopia (cat-calling, condescension, aging, reproductive health issues), but they are the problems that face both rich and poor women. A monologue delivered by America Ferrera about the difficulty of being a woman in our society focuses on things like the pressure to be thin and not complain (“You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line.”) It doesn’t, however, mention the pay gap or the amount of difficult unpaid labor women have to do, a strange omission given how long and seemingly comprehensive the speech is. I realize I will sound like the most ridiculous caricature of a leftist if I fault Barbie for “not having an economic analysis.” But it’s a movie that is packed with social satire. What it will not touch is corporate consumer culture or capitalism, because ultimately, as we have seen, Barbie is a device for Mattel to sell products.
In fact, Barbie is a kind of brilliant work of selective subversion, biting everything except the hand that feeds it. Oh sure, Gerwig is a bit mean to Mattel itself, with its board portrayed as a bunch of clueless white men. But Mattel clearly knew it would only help them to appear able to take a joke, and Gerwig knew implicitly the kinds of jokes about Mattel she could make versus the kinds she couldn’t make. (I am reminded of Donald Trump’s rule for his Comedy Central roast that comedians could make cracks about almost anything, including his hair, as long as they never implied he was lying about how much money he had. In other words, they could not undermine the “Trump brand.”) Gerwig did not, after all, do anything in the film that implied people should stop buying Barbie dolls. Instead, she served Mattel brilliantly, by bringing an amusing self-awareness to the promotional aspect of the film, including a full-length parody of a Barbie commercial. As Gerwig has said, “Things can be both/and. I’m doing the thing and subverting the thing.” But can they? If an artist “sells out” to a corporation, making successful commercials for that company’s products, how can they possibly be “subverting” it at the same time? I doubt Mattel feels especially subverted by Gerwig’s critiques; they’re going to be pleading with her to take on the Uno movie next, and hoping she includes some digs at the corporate suits in the script that will get audiences saying the name Mattel.
Instead of thinking of the Barbie movie as both “doing the thing and subverting the thing,” it makes more sense to apply the analysis laid out by Thomas Frank in his classic book The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism. Frank demonstrated how the advertising industry had co-opted the rebellious imagery of the ’60s counterculture in order to sell products. Pepsi told young people they were part of a “Pepsi Generation” that valued freedom and nonconformity. Apple portrayed its desktop computer as a strike against the Orwellian establishment for those who “think different.” Apple even had an ad showing pictures of people deemed nonconforming “crazy ones,” including Einstein, Bob Dylan, Richard Branson, Ted Turner, Amelia Earhart, MLK Jr., and John Lennon, implying that King and Lenonn would probably have used Macs had they not been assassinated. This wasn’t even the most shameless appropriation of King’s image for commercial purposes. That would be the time Dodge ran a commercial for Ram trucks with a King voiceover—excerpted from a speech where King actually criticized car commercials! Mattel is just trying to do the same thing with Barbie: Barbie dolls were critiqued by feminists, but why not try to rebrand Barbie as a feminist icon, so that when people buy Barbies, they feel like they’re part of the project of female empowerment?
Why is it so objectionable when corporations do this? Well, corporations are at their root devices for turning money into more money. The corporation’s job is not to serve the social good, to practice certain values, or even to make toys. It is to serve the interests of its owners. So a Mattel Barbie movie does not come about because someone has a deep artistic vision for a Barbie movie. It comes about because the corporation “sees the growth opportunity in these franchise deals as ‘exponential.’” (The fact that the director hired to make the movie does have a deep artistic vision doesn’t change that fact.) John Lennon and Albert Einstein were used by Apple to make money, not even because someone honestly thought they would have used Macs, but because an advertising firm realized that they could create an association between rebelliousness and Apple products that would drive sales. What is perverse about advertising is that it is built on dishonesty and bad faith. It says “you value freedom, the product embodies freedom, thus you should buy this product,” but the person crafting the message doesn’t care a lick about freedom. They just know you do, and that they can make money from your values by pretending to embody them.
This is, incidentally, why the conservative critique of the “woke corporation” is so off base. Christopher Rufo argues that leftists have staged a “long march through the institutions” and taken over corporate boards, which is why you see Pride flags and #BLM slogans coming from giant corporations. But that’s based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the corporation. They exist to sell products. If it were true that when you “go woke,” you “go broke,” they wouldn’t go woke. We can see precisely what happens when social justice conflicts with the bottom line rather than serving it. When Bud Light made the “mistake” of supporting a transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, creating an insane conservative backlash, the executives responsible were quickly placed on leave, and the company made zero effort to support Mulvaney as she was menaced with public hate. Money, not morality, determines corporate behavior. If Barbie had flopped, you’d never see another feminist message in a Mattel movie. Now that it has shattered box office records, don’t be surprised if the Uno movie uses the different colors of cards to send an unsubtle message about racial harmony.
Corporations don’t just respond to public demand. They also create it. There was no preexisting public hunger for a Barbie movie. The $150 million marketing campaign is an investment meant to yield a return by shaping public taste and getting people to hand over dollars. Because corporations manufacture desires through propaganda (for instance, by convincing people that they are cooler if they wear a certain brand of more expensive shoe), it’s crucial to analyze and understand how our culture itself is shaped by the profit motive.
And yet: I would argue that there is less of a “left critique of consumer culture” than there once was. Books like Naomi Klein’s No Logo and Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, and the satirical Adbusters magazine, seem relics of a different era in left discourse, where advertising, branding, and the commodification of culture were subject to more intense scrutiny. My amateur theory here is that today’s left is more concerned with production than consumption, by which I mean that a socialist magazine like Jacobin is much more interested in the question of who owns a corporation than in what it sells. From this perspective, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was an “awesome” “ colorful and inspiring show,” marred only by labor exploitation on the set. (I don’t have an opinion on the Power Rangers, I only note that this is a common type of socialist critique, which leaves the cultural object itself entirely untouched and focuses entirely on injustices in the production process.) The Jacobin or DSA socialist is interested in getting the workers of a Mattel a fair deal that shifts as much power away from shareholders as possible. This doesn’t necessarily leave room for a critique of Mattel’s actual business model, or its products, because ultimately it’s in the interest of the company’s workers, just as much as its owners, to sell as many Barbies and Hot Wheels cars and Uno decks as possible.
I am a firm economic socialist, by which I mean that I believe in a democratic economy where industry operates for the benefit of all, and is owned by all, rather than being operated to serve the narrow private interests of a small class of capitalists. But there’s much more to my socialism than moving wealth and ownership rights around. Let’s think, for instance, about cigarette companies. One problem with cigarette companies is that they use propaganda to try to convince people that smoking is cool, but their product is ultimately deadly and kills many of its customers. You could change the ownership structure of a cigarette company, so that it was owned by its workers. Or you could put a cigarette company in the hands of a sovereign wealth fund, so that the public at large received dividends from cigarette sales (like Norwegians and Alaskans get from state oil revenues). This might create “socialism,” in one sense of the term, since it would be collective ownership. But you would not have touched the problem of an institution that makes its money through ruthlessly manipulating people into slowly committing suicide.
Benjamin Fong, in his fascinating new book Quick Fixes, discusses why drugs present something of a conundrum for the left. On the one hand, leftists detest the war on drugs, and want to see drugs legalized. We don’t want to be puritanical morality police condemning drug use, Reefer Madness style. On the other hand, cigarettes and alcohol, perfectly legal drugs, destroy many people’s lives. Is there a left critique of this? What is the specifically leftist grievance against the selling of harmful products? Is it a lack of worker control? The pursuit of profit? If there is demand for the harmful product, would it be wrong for a state-owned, not for profit entity to sell it in response to public demand? Will there be cigarettes under socialism?
I think that the left needs a lot more and deeper cultural critique than we currently have. I don’t just mean takes on whether a particular movie has a status quo justifying message or a subversive message, although I think political film criticism is important. I mean I’d like to see a lot more leftist analysis of architecture, art, theater, children’s toys, YouTubers, talk radio, pulp novels, museums, religion, television commercials, graphic design, board games, and pop songs. I try to publish some of this kind of analysis at Current Affairs. For instance, one of our earliest successful pieces here was a critique of the assumptions underlying the hugely successful “Hamilton” musical. One of my favorite of my own pieces was a long study of the National World War II Museum, showing how it contributes to crafting a dangerous national mythology. I’d like to encourage more leftist thinking and writing that focuses on the messages and lessons to be found seemingly trivial things. (I think the Michael and Us podcast does this very well.)
I detect a strain on the contemporary American left (to the extent that there is a contemporary American left) that fears socialist critiques of pop culture will be elitist and irrelevant, preferring to focus on more consequential matters like who has healthcare, whether the planet will be wrecked, and who controls industry. That set of priorities seems completely reasonable to me. And we don’t want to end up sounding humorless and un-fun, the Very Serious Socialist Left that can’t enjoy the Power Rangers. Become too critical, and you become like the World Socialist Website, scolding Jacobin as “the voice of the affluent, complacent ‘left’ petty bourgeoisie” for enjoying Barbie.
But I also think that work like that of Klein and Frank, who exposed how corporations manipulate and fabricate desire, adds something crucial. And if we must have a cycle of popular discourse about the Barbie movie, I think it’s just as important to discuss how people can be manipulated into suddenly wanting to wear something pink as it is to discuss whether the feminist message of the film landed. Part of the job of left criticism is to dig deep and figure out how corporations can cause us to want what we want and do what we do.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cnJlbnRhZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA4L2lzLXRoZS1jcml0aXF1ZS1vZi1jb25zdW1lcmlzbS1kZWFk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-11 09:00:44+00:00,Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ Dream Job,Mattel wanted a summer blockbuster to kick off its new wave of brand-extension movies. She wanted it to be a work of art.,"We have come this far without attending to Ken, which is the predicament of Ken. While I was working on this article, I had Barbie books scattered around the house, and whenever my 6-year-old daughter saw a picture of Ken, she would push the book away in disgust and say, “EWWWWW, KEN!” When Gerwig first spoke with Ryan Gosling about playing the role, he told her that his daughters had a Ken and that he once found it beneath a rotting lemon. Both of these things are very Ken.
In the funhouse-mirror world that is Barbieland, Barbies have all the power, and the Kens are their accessories. Not to put too fine a point on it, but: Kens are the women of Barbieland. It’s just that no one is objectifying them, because no one has the genitalia to make lust a thing. Ken would like a chaste good-night kiss anyway, but Barbie would prefer he leave, so he always does. When Ken hitches a ride into the real world, his experience is as eye-opening as Barbie’s. She learns how difficult it is to be a woman. He learns how great it is to be a man. Ken gets red-pilled on patriarchy.
Gosling spent a year demurring about the role. “There were times where I was sure I wasn’t doing the film,” he recalls. “I would call my agent and ask who was playing Ken. And they would say, ‘Greta says you are.’” Eventually he committed: “She was just, in the end, more confident that I should play him than I was that I shouldn’t.” During that year of talking and the preparation that followed, it became clear that Ken needed an additional beat, some catharsis that wasn’t in the script. If you are making a movie that is trying to take the contradictions of modern womanhood seriously and you have a character in your movie who cannot define himself or understand his own worth — a character who kicks sand all day hoping just to be looked at by someone with power — you have to take that plight seriously, even if the character is male. You don’t have to do this because Mattel or Warner Brothers is insisting. You have to do this because the movie is insisting.
So it became clear: Ken needed a dream dance number. (Gerwig shrugs: “I like dream ballets, and I like mothers.”) She has a habit of referring to “Barbie” as a musical, and that’s not wildly inaccurate: It has a soundtrack, overseen by Mark Ronson, of original pop songs, and another big choreographed dance number besides Ken’s. Gerwig screened musicals for the entire cast, and she thinks of the Mattel executives in the movie as being something like tuxedo-clad 1930s tap dancers. But there is only one character who breaks out into a power ballad, and it is Ken. “I’m just Ken/Anywhere else I’d be a 10,” Gosling wails as he heads to a Ken-on-Ken beach battle that leads to a Ken-and-Ken dream ballet that ultimately allows Ken to realize that he is “Kenough.”
It is not a coincidence that the moment Gerwig singled out as always surprising her — the one that makes her think, “why did they let us do this?” — is the one that involves the Kens riding their invisible horses to their Mojo Dojo Casa Houses, after the dream ballet, after they have stormed the Barbieland beach and fought with lacrosse sticks and suction-cup arrows. It is in those moments that the movie has most completely slipped the bounds of anything a Barbie movie needed to do, shooting past the critique, and the subversion of the critique, and the upending, sidestepping, teasing and embracing of the critique, to go off into its own orbit. Liftoff has been achieved. Ken has momentarily run away with the picture.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTEvbWFnYXppbmUvZ3JldGEtZ2Vyd2lnLWJhcmJpZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-26 14:30:00+00:00,The Super Fun ‘Barbie’ Soundtrack Is About to Take Over the World,"Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie, Mark Ronson, Charli XCX, PinkPantheress, and others dish on the highly anticipated all-star soundtrack for ‘Barbie.’","Barbie opens with the world’s favorite doll having the perfect day: She has her perfect world full of other perfect Barbies who may look and dress differently but act exactly the same. And there’s the doting love of Ken, whose existence is mostly an accessory to Barbie’s. The next day, it all goes terribly, terribly wrong. Soundtracking it is “Pink,” by Lizzo, a song that describes exactly what Barbie is experiencing onscreen — a campy touch of Eighties TV tropes to build out her pastel world.
“Lizzo’s lyrics are just so funny,” says main Barbie Margot Robbie, “and add an extra layer of comedy that I thought was quite genius.”
The Barbie soundtrack is one of the most important weapons in writer-director Greta Gerwig’s arsenal. Many of the film’s scenes have highly specific musical cues that she was seeking, which means she needed a team on board from the beginning to make the vision come alive.
“You’re hearing lyrics that are responding to what’s happening onscreen, so the music became more than just music — it became a device to enhance what the audience was watching and experiencing, and got to be the voice of the audience,” adds Robbie.
Atlantic nabbed the project early, working closely with Gerwig and her co-writer husband, Noah Baumbach.
“This was a really competitive project in our landscape, but we’ve been tracking Barbie for a long time,” says Kevin Weaver, Atlantic Records’ West Coast president. The label was a particularly strong partner for this project, having dominated the soundtrack market over the past several years, thanks to albums for Robbie’s Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey, as well as the Fast and the Furious franchise and the recent Daisy Jones & the Six.
The Barbie team knew they needed two songs in particular as soon as possible: a showstopping pop number for a highly choreographed dance scene, and a big Eighties-style power ballad for Ken, played by Ryan Gosling.
That was when Oscar- and seven-time Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter Mark Ronson (A Star Is Born) got a text from his music-supervisor pal George Drakoulias. “Barbie?” is all it said. Ronson Zoomed with the Barbie squad while they were in England prepping for production. They told him they needed at least the basis of a song for the showstopper in two weeks. Editor’s picks

“I don’t read a lot of scripts, but it was just everything I want in a movie,” Ronson recalls. “I was like, ‘If I don’t get this gig, this is gonna be my favorite movie of the year.’ ”
Along with collaborator Andrew Wyatt, the pair cooked up the beat to the disco dance-floor burner “Dance the Night,” based off a playlist of songs Gerwig had put together for them. Luckily, Gerwig loved what they sent her.
“We did all our dance rehearsals to the beat of the song before the lyrics were overlaid on top,” Robbie recalls. “It became the Barbie anthem on set. The dance-rehearsal time was really the first opportunity for all the actors playing Barbies to bond and make friends.”
Disco felt like the perfect reference point for what Barbie experiences, especially after she steps into the real world. As Gerwig told Robbie: “Disco comes with the assumption that people want to dance and have a good time. It didn’t realize it stopped being cool in the Seventies. Disco had no idea people started listening to punk rock. Disco is still there, in bell-bottoms, doing its thing.’”

“Dance the Night,” which was written for fellow Barbie star Dua Lipa to perform, is intrinsic to the DNA of the film, according to Weaver. But Ronson and Wyatt also became integral to the story: Together, the twosome composed an original score for the movie, and Ronson serves as executive producer for the soundtrack. Over nearly a full year, Ronson was tasked with helping curate songs that perfectly matched what Gerwig had envisioned. The soundtrack came together just as the movie did: working in lockstep and feeding into one another.
“[Gerwig] had a vision for a really diverse and unique world that she was creating,” Brandon Davis, executive VP and co-head of pop A&R at Atlantic, explains. “That’s why you’re hearing, for instance, a Karol G record that leans more reggaeton next to a Dominic Fike record that’s a nod to Sugar Ray.”
As Barbie was being edited, Ronson and Gerwig got into the habit of showing scenes from the film to a new artist on their wish list each week.
“Everybody would watch the scene and come back a week or two weeks later, and got exactly to the heart of everything we were trying to do,” Ronson says.
One of his first calls was to his friend Charli XCX, a huge Barbie fan who says her “first live performance” was an a cappella rendition of Aqua’s “Barbie Girl” when she was four years old, for a cruise-ship talent show. (She ended up winning.)
“My parents were like, ‘Oh, my God. No.’ They were really worried that I was going to get up on the stage and cry, and it would be a disaster,” she explains. “But I was adamant that I wanted to do it. I just sang it on the microphone with new music — the whole song — and I won the contest.”
Ronson and Gerwig gave Charli XCX a few scenes to pick from, but pop’s foremost lover of car anthems was hooked on the chase scene, and ended up penning “Speed Drive.”

“I’ve always really liked singing about cars,” she says. “For me, there is this intrinsic link between driving and music and feeling like you’re a star when you’re in a car.”
She wanted “Speed Drive,” where she flips Toni Basil’s “Mickey” for the chorus, to “feel quite bratty” and “about just being hot.”
As for the aforementioned Aqua song, fans were outraged when the Danish group told the press last year that their 1997 pop hit would not be featured in the film. Even though it wasn’t in the script, Gerwig’s plan all along was to find a place for it, especially since Robbie and others were begging for it.
“I was like, ‘Greta, how are we going to incorporate this song? We can’t do a Barbie movie and not have a nod to Aqua’s ‘Barbie Girl.’ It has to be in there.’ And [Greta] was like, ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to find a cool way to incorporate it,’ ” recalls Robbie.
Robbie continues: “And then, when she was like, ‘Guess who’s going to do the remix of Aqua’s “Barbie Girl”? Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice.’ I was like, ‘Together? Are you joking?!’ I just knew immediately that all my girlfriends were going to lose their minds.”
For Ronson the music maestro, getting the queen of the Barbz to rap over an extended version of “Barbie Girl” seemed like a no-brainer.

“I feel like people have been asking Nicki to rhyme over some version of ‘Barbie Girl’ for 15 years now,” Ronson says.

As for Ice Spice, it was almost impossible to pin down the extremely in-demand rapper. She was due at the studio earlier in the day to lay down her verses but couldn’t make it until after midnight. Ronson, who was already getting ready for bed “like an old guy,” ended up biking back to the studio in the middle of the night to make it happen.

Karol G also made sure to carve out time in a crazy year to make the “wild and raucous” track “Watati.” She was the musical guest on SNL merely six hours after sitting in Ronson’s studio watching scenes from Barbie. PinkPantheress may not have owned any Barbies as a kid (“Only because my mom didn’t get them for me,” she shares), but she studied Gerwig’s filmography when she was in school, since she dreamed of becoming an actress prior to pursuing music. She was thrilled at the prospect of working with the director, which inspired the sound of the wistful “Angel.”

Having now spent the better part of a year in Barbie’s world, Ronson still isn’t ready to leave. “This movie is so insanely good-looking and visually captivating,” he says. “You could just pause on the most random shot anywhere in this film and stare at it like it was a painting in the Louvre for an hour because there’s a thousand shades of pink.”

When he began the endeavor, Ronson bought an assortment of Barbies from Toys R Us and placed them around his studio (as well as some Kens that Mattel had to send him because he couldn’t find them in stores anywhere). As his work on the film was ending, he became a first-time dad to a baby girl.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9iYXJiaWUtc291bmR0cmFjay1tYXJrLXJvbnNvbi1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1kdWEtbGlwYS1uaWNraS1taW5hai0xMjM0Nzc1MDY3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,In Appreciation of Allan: The Unsung Hero of the ‘Barbie’ Movie,"Barbie and Ken might be the center of attention, but Allan provides the movie's moral center and heart.","Allan has been an under-appreciated hero in the world of Barbie from the very beginning. Introduced as “Ken’s buddy” in 1964, the doll’s main selling point was that he could wear all of Ken’s clothes. Allan’s other job was being the groom to Midge — Barbie’s less glamorous best friend — and a father to their three children. When Ken was busy at the beach or sunning himself by the pool, Allan was just out there being a solid partner and a good dad. And what thanks did he get? He was around for just two years after Mattel introduced him, and brought back only briefly in 1991 and 2002.

It makes sense, then, that Allan is very much a side character in Barbie. But in Michael Cera’s hands, he routinely steals the show. Just as Margot Robbie’s beauty and inherent likability make her the quintessential Barbie, and Ryan Gosling’s comedy chops and chiseled features make him a fantastic Ken, Cera is the right combination of cute-but-weird to make Allan make sense. There are a few things that miss the mark in the movie (including a weird, overstrung ending), but casting is most definitely not one of them.

The crux of Barbie‘s plot goes like this: Barbie and all her Barbie friends are living in Barbieland, having the best day ever, every single day. The Kens are around and fun companions, but it’s the Barbies who are running things. This is a world where every night is girls’ night, the Supreme Court looks like a Miss America pageant, and no one knows where the Kens even live.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtxZWQub3JnL2FydHMvMTM5MzE3NTMvYWxsYW4tZG9sbC1taWNoYWVsLWNlcmEtZ3JldGEtZ2Vyd2lnLWJhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-08-01 20:54:30+00:00,Guest Column: How Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ Tends to Her Superpowers,'Tiny Shoulders' director Andrea Nevins discusses the themes in the new Barbie film.,"Greta Gerwig’s Barbie begins with a humorous — but nonetheless brutally fitting — homage to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. It features the same moment of sheer, speechless awe, but instead of a black monolith, the little girls who inhabit this planet discover a monolithic version of the original 1959 Barbie, iconic black cat eye sunglasses, strapless black and white maillot. Kubrick has said that his monolith represented a powerful and unknowable alien life form, a blank canvas upon which viewers could unleash their own powers of imagination exponentially more than a cinematic representation ever could. For the generation of little girls who wouldn’t be able to sign their own checks without a man, have careers beyond those ascribed to the softer sex, nor even keep their own names, the canvas for unleashing their imaginations was Barbie.

The gift Ruth Handler offered young girls when she invented the doll 65 years ago was the opportunity to imagine what was then utterly unimaginable: an adulthood of their own. Dolls before this were baby dolls, meant to allow little girls to rehearse the inevitable end of a woman’s story. With this doll, a girl could play-act a world in which she could be a doctor or an astronaut or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company (something Ruth was able to do by the ’60s, but she was a unicorn). She could even own her own dream home. And she didn’t need a man to sign her checks. She offered open-ended play, albeit with a close-ended, societally dictated, male view of beauty. But she was autonomous and it felt powerful.

Warner Bros. Pictures

This is the dream world Gerwig conjures in Barbie. In her version, there is a Black woman president, an all-female Supreme Court and even all-female construction sites. It’s also a world where women can be feminine and dress in skimpy sequins just because it is fabulous and fun and not to attract the male gaze. When Ken leans in for a kiss after a girls night dance party, Barbie not only has no interest, she has no guilt that she might have set herself up for this sexual attention just by being her exuberant, feminine self. It is a child’s version of what it means to be a grown-up. Yes, she looked like a stereotypical movie star, but she could do anything. There are no casting couches in her world, no doors being slammed in her face, no roadblocks.

Roadblocks exist in the adult world and that has been Barbie’s problem since the moment of her invention. As soon as the interpretation of her is taken out of a child’s point of view and is seen through the lens of an adult, everything changes. The doll instantly becomes not a toy but a symbol of all the contradictions of modern womanhood. As Gloria Steinem told me when I asked her why feminists detested the doll in the ’70s, a sentiment that has persisted, she said “She was everything we were told to be and were fighting against.”

And so it’s when the adult world intrudes into Barbie Land that Gerwig’s Barbie’s unshakeable optimism turns to existential dread. The dolls are only meant to exist to spark the imaginations of children, not adults, and the tear in the fabric of the universe is when an adult begins to play with the doll. The character Gloria (perhaps an homage to the aforementioned Gloria) is a working mother struggling with questions of meaning and self-worth as her maturing daughter begins to push her away. We see her daughter, Sasha, sending her big box of Barbies off to Goodwill. Sasha has reached the age when doll play is replaced by teenage rebellion. But Gloria rescues one Barbie from the pile.

She begins to play with the doll, imagining costumes for her that bespeak human mid-life crisis concerns, including Full Body Cellulite Barbie and Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie. And because an adult is playing with this doll, imbuing her with middle-age concerns, Margot Robbie’s Barbie, once obliviously happy, suddenly develops cellulite and is troubled by thoughts of death.

So Barbie sets off to try to set things right. She arrives in Venice Beach wearing her leotard and rollerblades and is immediately shocked by the danger she feels under the male gaze. Because of the ogling and sexist comments, she seeks comfort from a group of construction workers. In her world, they were always supportive friends. But she finds more threatening sexual objectification. Before blading off, she reminds them that their fantasies can never be satisfied because, as a Barbie, she has no vagina. This absurdly genius idea of turning the threat on its head by removing genitals from the equation is explored by several female comedians. One of my favorites is Wanda Sykes’ version. She asks us to imagine a world in which women could come home from work, pull on their sneakers, grab their keys, leave their vaginas behind on the bureau and feel safe to take an evening run through the park.

Another of Barbie’s experiences in the real world is her first glimpse of a postmenopausal woman. Barbie’s don’t age, so it’s foreign to her. She examines the woman for a moment and says in a manner utterly devoid of guile, “You’re so beautiful.” Barbie has only seen the world through the female lens, so her beauty tenets have not been shaped by what is aesthetically pleasing to men.

This deep appreciation for women becomes a valuable element when the Ruth character in the movie suggests Barbie could become human. This choice, at first blush, might seem ridiculous to many in the Barbie audience. Why would she want to leave such a magical place as Barbie Land? It’s the question Gloria is struggling with as well. Why would her daughter want to leave her cozy, safe childhood? Why would she or Barbie want to enter the adult world of women where, as she rants, “You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard!!! It’s too contradictory!!!”

It’s much easier to be a child.

But there is also something magnificent about becoming a woman, despite the continued limitations and dangers attendant in that. Barbie, having witnessed something we as women have been programmed not to see, not to value, wants to become a part of the profound affinity group that the shared experience of womanhood creates. We are not men. We bleed. We can gestate another human life. We can make milk. We fight for our reproductive freedom. We weather menopause. And we laugh and cry about these things on girls nights. And in this movie, in Barbie’s view, in Gerwig’s view, in Ruth’s view, womanhood is a superpower. Barbie decides to join the real world because she wanted the gift Ruth gave to girls when she invented the doll. She wanted to become the subject, the creator of the narrative and not the object. And Barbie, in her very first stop as Barbara Handler, real woman, tends to her superpower, because it’s the most important thing. She goes to the gynecologist.

""Warning: Don't take your daughter to Barbie,"" Movieguide, a Christian movie review site warned ahead of the film's release July 21. The review criticized the film about the iconic doll of abandoning its core audience of families and little girls to instead focus on LGBTQ stories.

""The new BARBIE movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender character stories. Furthermore, the movie was poorly made with multiple premises, losing even the most die-hard fans,"" the scathing staff review-penned piece began.

""They had a built-in market and audience for this franchise that they completely ignored,"" the story continued. ""Millions of families would have turned out to the theaters and purchased tickets, but instead, Mattel chose to cater to a small percentage of the population who has proven over and over to abandon the box office.""

Star Simu Liu has also praised the film for deconstructing ""heteronormative"" gender roles about toys and colors.

""And I’m so glad that this movie exists because I think it puts the final nail in the coffin of that very heteronormative idea of what gender is, and what is or is not gendered,"" he said during an interview with Screen Rant’s Joe Deckelmeier.

While discussing the film's feminist themes with Fandango, actress and ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Kate McKinnon revealed she knew she wanted to be in the film after reading about how the script deconstructs gender roles.

""I knew it was going to be something and then I read it, and it was like, sort of about how like gender roles deny people half their humanity and how like we need to just like be ourselves,"" McKinnon said.

Co-star Issa Rae praised the film for sidelining Barbie's male counterpart, ""Ken"", to be an ""accessory"" for Barbie.

Rae told interview host Naz Perez, ""I think a Ken for me is just kind of there. I think a Ken is just a great accessory. That’s what I loved about Greta’s imagining of Barbie is that the Kens are just supplemental characters to these Barbies.""

,Earnings Beat of the Week: Mattel Reports Surprise Profit Amid Barbie Box Office Hit,"Toy company Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, reported a surprise profit in the second quarter, as the success and promotional impact of the box office hit Barbie offset lower toy sales.","Mattel (MAT), the maker of Barbie dolls, reported a surprise profit in the second quarter, as the success and promotional impact of the box office hit Barbie offset lower toy sales.

Key Takeaways The Barbie movie, which grossed $162 million in its opening weekend, helped offset lower toy sales at Mattel.

Mattel reported an unexpected profit of $27 billion, or 10 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations of a three-cent loss.

Net sales fell 12% compared with last year's quarter, reflecting a broader pullback in consumer spending, but less than projections of a 19% fall.



Net sales fell 12% compared with the same quarter last year, including an 18% fall in North America and reflecting a broader pullback in discretionary spending. Sales of Barbie dolls were among those that fell, mostly early in the quarter, while those of Hot Wheels and 'Monster High' dolls rose. The overall decline was smaller than expected, as Wall Street analysts had projected a 19% fall.

Net income came in at $27 million, well below $66 million in the year-ago quarter, but exceeding analysts' estimates. Earnings per share (EPS) of 10 cents also beat expectations of a three-cent loss.

The report comes shortly after the July 21 release of the Barbie movie, a box office hit that grossed $162 million in its opening weekend. While the movie is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), it's had a significant promotional impact on Mattel and helped drive sales of Barbie dolls higher in recent weeks.

In conjunction with the film, Mattel said it is partnering with 165 brands on Barbie products, while CEO Ynon Kreiz hailed the movie's soundtrack as another success for the company.

Acknowledging the lasting impact the Barbie movie could have on the company and the value of its intellectual property, Kreiz said the moment ""will be remembered as a key milestone in our company’s history with the release of the Barbie movie, our first-ever major theatrical film.""

""The Barbie movie is a showcase for the cultural resonance of our IP, our ability to attract and collaborate with top creative talent, and the capabilities of our franchise management organization,"" he continued.

,Barbieland and the Garden of Eden - The Gospel Coalition,"The Barbie movie provides a genuine opportunity to engage with people who don’t yet know Jesus. Barbie could be your invitation to start conversations about the true utopia, life in the new creation, the relationship between the sexes and and how all of us are invited to find our purpose in Christ.","*This piece contains spoilers.

Like millions of others, I fell captive to the marketing genius of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie. On the movie’s opening day, I donned my pinkest outfit and joined my friends to see Barbie in all her glittery glory.

But for a movie purporting to be fun and light-hearted, I was fascinated to see how its characters also wrestled with questions of death, gender, and purpose. Barbieland reflects its own kind of Garden of Eden, inviting Christians to compare and contrast the film with Scripture while opening the door for worthwhile conversations.

“Do You Guys Ever Think About Dying?”

In the pink plastic paradise of Barbieland, women can be anything: a CEO, the President, an Astronaut, a construction worker, a mother. Every day is perfect until Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) asks in the middle of a dance number, “Do you guys ever think about dying?”

In the same way that death is an unwanted intruder in Barbieland, human death had no rightful place in the Garden of Eden. God saw everything he had made, including humanity, and declared it very good (Gen 1:31). Death entered the Garden as a result of the Fall, where Adam and Eve listened to their own wisdom rather than the wisdom of God. Creation was therefore cursed:

By the sweat of your brow

you will eat your food

until you return to the ground,

since from it you were taken;

for dust you are

and to dust you will return. (Genesis 3:19)

Death is a foreign enemy, an unwanted houseguest, the most unnatural part of life. Barbie desperately wants to eradicate her negative thoughts, leading her on a journey to the Real World. In the end, Barbie chooses a mortal and meaningful life over a shallow immortality.

For Christians, it is true that death makes way for salvation history, which brings glory to God and a greater outcome for those who are in Christ, the second Adam (1 Cor 15:20–28, 42–58). And yet, fundamentally, death is not a good thing, nor is immortality a bad thing.

As alluded to in Genesis 3:15, God becomes the serpent-crusher when Jesus journeys to the cross, defeating sin and death and providing for us the hope of rich, meaningful, eternal life in the new creation. As the perfect and infinite source of all truth, justice, meaning and beauty, an eternity of service to God is not plastic and hollow.

The Struggle Between Barbie and Ken

With a film like Barbie being released in 2023, and in light of today’s gender politics, there is little surprise about its focus on the relationship between men and women as typified in Barbie and Ken. The picture painted by the co-writing duo Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach (partners in real life) shows a genuine struggle between the sexes.[1]

Early in the movie, the narrator states: “Barbie has a great day every day, but Ken only has a great day if Barbie looks at him.”

While Barbie shows that women can do anything and be anything, Ken is merely a sidekick. When Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes with Stereotypical Barbie to the Real World, he is thrilled to discover patriarchy for the first time. When Ken attempts to bring patriarchy to Barbieland, life for the Barbies turns out for the worse.

How does this compare to the picture of life in the Garden of Eden? Consider God’s words in Genesis chapter 1 verses 26 to 27:

Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

So God created mankind in his own image,

in the image of God he created them;

male and female he created them.

From the Garden, men and women were both made in God’s image. Not only this, men and women need each other to serve together as co-workers in God’s creation. When God first made Adam, there was “no suitable helper” for him from among the animals (Gen 2:20). So when Adam cries out that Eve is “bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” (Gen 2:23), he is primarily overjoyed at Eve’s sameness. She is like him!

Christians, therefore, reject the kind of patriarchy that Ken discovers and imitates, in which men are domineering over women. This is one mark of a cursed creation caused by the Fall (Gen 3:16). At the same time, a world which is almost entirely run by women is not in line with God’s good design for humanity, which Barbie comes just short of claiming.

Barbie and Ken are also presented as having some level of difference (she has her Dream House while he has his Mojo Dojo Casa House—the equivalent of a man cave). Shared humanity does not rule out any difference between the sexes. The Bible leads us to expect that these differences will also mean that men and women, in general, will experience particular challenges in a sinful world.

More than this, though, in his ordering, God has given particular roles for men and women in the world. This is reflected in marriage, ultimately pointing to the relationship between Christ and the church (Rev 21:2, Eph 5:22–27), and in part highlighting the unique role women have in childbirth. God has also instructed order within his church, one element of which is qualified men serving as overseers (1 Tim 3:1–13). Thus, Christians living in light of God’s sovereign design will not fully reflect Barbieland, even though this film will be a prompt for lots of worthwhile conversations.

Where Do You Find Your Purpose?

Ken’s major struggle throughout the movie is one of identity: his entire personhood is defined by being Barbie’s boyfriend. The resolution includes a frank conversation between Robbie’s Barbie and Gosling’s Ken:

Ken: I just don’t know who I am without you.

Barbie: You’re Ken.

Ken: But it’s ‘Barbie and Ken’. There is no just ‘Ken’.

Barbie: Maybe it’s time to discover who Ken is.

Barbie helps Ken realise he is enough (or “Kenough”, as the movie playfully puts it). Ken must work out his purpose and find himself rather than being defined by the relationships he is placed in. On the other hand, Barbie finds purpose in becoming an active part of the world rather than simply an idea.

It’s true that in Christianity there is individual responsibility for sin and an individual call to come to Jesus and find forgiveness (John 7:37). But whereas Barbie seems to primarily emphasise the importance of establishing our identity independent of each other, the Bible strongly emphasises that men and women also need each other. In the Garden of Eden, God gives men and women this creation mandate:

God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” (Genesis 1:28)

Now that the mystery of salvation is revealed in Jesus, we see that being fruitful in the world involves partnering together to fulfil his Great Commission (Mat 28:16–20). At the most fundamental level, our very identity comes not from within but from who God has called us to be as a royal priesthood of believers in Christ (1 Pet 2:9). Thus, our individual identity is found in relationship to God and to one another.

The Barbie movie provides a genuine opportunity to engage with people who don’t yet know Jesus. Barbie could be your invitation to start conversations about the true utopia, life in the new creation, the relationship between the sexes and and how all of us are invited to find our purpose in Christ.

,Amy Schumer reacts to Barbie years after dropping out of film,Amy Schumer took in a double feature of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' and shared her thoughts on the movie on Instagram.,"Amy Schumer was nearly a Barbie girl in a Barbie world. That is, until she bowed out of the then-Diablo Cody scripted project in 2017. Over the weekend, she revisited the world of Barbies once more — as an audience member and took to social media after to share what she thought of the film.

The comedian took in a double feature of both Barbie and Oppenheimer (aka Barbenheimer), then shared an Instagram snap. In the photo, she's clad in an oversized straw hat peering over some rosy pink sunglasses. ""Really enjoyed Barbie and Oppenheimer but I think I should have played Emily Blunts role,"" she joked. ""Do better Hollywood.""

The Inside Amy Schumer star noted her excitement for the pink-tastic film during a June episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, insisting she ""couldn't wait"" to see the movie. ""I think it looks awesome,"" she said at the time.

Schumer was originally cast as Barbie in 2016 but a year later she announced she was leaving the project, citing ""scheduling conflicts."" She explained the situation further during her chat with Cohen, admitting she actually left for a different reason.

""I think we said it was scheduling conflicts,"" she revealed. ""That's what we said. But it really was just like, creative differences. But there's a new team behind it and it looks like it's very feminist and cool, so I will be seeing this movie.""

Schumer told The Hollywood Reporter in 2022 that one of the reasons she left involved a shoe made out of Jell-O.

""They definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,"" Schumer said. Her vision of Barbie was an ""inventor,"" but the studio wanted her invention to be a shoe crafted from gelatin. ""The idea that that's just what every woman must want, right there, I should have gone, 'You've got the wrong gal.'""

In 2019, it was officially confirmed that Margot Robbie had joined the cast as the film's Barbie. All's well that ends well, though, as Schumer appears to be happy with the final product — and the film opened at a whopping $155 million. As many more fans head off to Barbie Land, one thing is for certain: life in plastic is certainly fantastic for Mattel's popular property, no matter who plays the popular doll.

2023-07-21 13:53:58+00:00,"Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is a Fascinating, Spectacular Philosophical Experiment",,"Do you remember the scene in Singin’ in the Rain where Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse dance a romantic, longing modernist-ballet number? That scene is a dream sequence within a dream sequence. Gene Kelly’s character, an actor in late 20s Hollywood, is pitching a movie to a studio head and the film allows the viewer to watch the description he is conjuring. In this imaginary scene, a “young hoofer” comes to Broadway with dreams of being a star, and has them stymied for a while, along the way meeting a beautiful woman—Cyd Charisse—who is dating a gangster. He imagines falling in love with her anyway, and so the film takes us to that fantasy, which takes the form of a windy dance on a blue-and-pink-tinted soundstage.

What we’re watching is so far removed from the plot of the actual Singin’ in the Rain—which is about the Hollywood community adjusting after the advent of sound technology—but it doesn’t matter. It is a beautiful scene, a stunning bodily representation of desire and passion in the brief moment they are allowed to manifest. Movies don’t exist just to relay plots; they have tools and qualities all their own that permit experimentation, and even allow the visual exploration of abstract things like feelings, thoughts, and ideas.

It is known, via a Letterboxed profile curated by the writer-director-Greta Gerwig, that her new film Barbie takes some inspiration from Singin’ in the Rain, as well as other musicals from Hollywood’s Golden Age, including Kelly’s even more abstract An American in Paris. Gerwig’s Barbie, a dramatically hyped mainstream film about the famous Mattel doll that was created in 1959 and went on to become one of the most influential pop cultural forces in history, shares an essence with these movies.

It is an inventive, highly wildly conceptual thought experiment—not merely about the doll Barbie or even her complicated legacy and what she represents, but also about what it means to be a woman. It takes place in a similar kind of space as “the movie musical” writ large, a genre of alternate reality in which emotions and thoughts can be explored through music, song, dance, and other stuff that doesn’t happen in real life.

Barbie combines the rules of the movie musical’s imaginary netherworld with the investments of a Beckett or a Ionesco play. We’ve all seen plays where human actors play unwieldy concepts like “the city of St. Louis” or “polio” or even real material things like “bullets.” That’s the variety of inquiry Barbie is; yes, it explores the complex figure of the Barbie Doll through cinematic conventions of faux-documentary, movie-musical, and traditional Hero’s Journey narrative, but it also is simply an unreal experiment, a highly symbolic exercise where theoretical entities get to speak for themselves, and where real people get to tell anthropomorphized theoretical entities what effects they have on the human experience. The whole movie is a mise-en-abyme-heavy dream sequence, a fantasy of a dialogue between real women and womankind’s evolving, go-getting golem plaything.

I was fascinated by Barbie, which was written by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, and which earnestly takes on a lot of hard work and mostly pulls it off. Compellingly, Barbie literalizes the abstract and abstracts the literal as it progresses. Gerwig’s own (presumed) thoughts and research into three-score years of Barbie frame the story, especially via the movie’s opener, a 2001: A Space Odyssey pastiche in which little girls discover the Barbie doll for the first time; the narrator (Helen Mirren) reminds us that, before Barbie, little girls could only play with baby dolls, pretend to be mothers; Barbie was the first grown-up doll. She was the first major girl-marketed cultural signifier insisting that a girl could be someone other than a mother. And not only that, but that she could be someone glamorous and exciting.

After this, the film follows a day in the life of a blonde Barbie, the main Barbie, the “Barbie you think of when someone says ‘think of a Barbie,'” the film calls her. She is played by Margot Robbie, who also produced the film. She lives in Barbie Land, a realm where the souls? subconscious minds? astral projections? of literal Barbie Dolls live and interact together. While their doll-bodies are being played with in the Real World, their selves live here, though they take on the characteristics of the things happening to their doll-bodies in play. This means that Barbie Land is kind of magic; outfits change spontaneously depending on the activity, Barbies float from one level of their Dream Houses to another—as if they are being played with by invisible hands.

Barbie Land is a paradise of female empowerment. The narrator reminds us how Barbie has taken on many more meanings and identities since her debut in a bathing suit in 1959, and that the Barbie concept is diverse in terms of representations of female excellence and perfection. Barbie is all women, the narrator reminds us, and she is a reminder that women can do anything. In Barbie Land, the Barbies—beautiful, accomplished, happy in all their different appearances and jobs and roles—run a supportive, productive world. There are also Kens, who do not have jobs or purposes. Barbie’s Ken (Ryan Gosling) lives for her, longs to unite more with her, wants her to love him. In interviews, Gerwig has noted that Barbie, and not Ken, is the main draw of Mattel products, and analyzed its fascinating implications: “Ken was invented after Barbie, to burnish Barbie’s position in our eyes and in the world. That kind of creation myth is the opposite of the creation myth in Genesis.”

Gerwig notes the potential for Barbie’s incredible progressiveness and takes advantage of it—telling a story about a Barbie who discovers that, in actual life, women are seen as the accessories. For the record, I don’t think the film advocates that people of any gender should be accessories to those of another gender, but Barbie still allows us to revel in the delight of an all-female paradise for a while.

Anyway, one day, our Barbie begins to experience an existential crisis—she begins to wonder about dying and freak about about “forever” and stasis. Her feet loosen from their arched position and land flat on the floor. Panicking, she goes to see an oracle-style Barbie known as Weird Barbie, maimed with crayons and perpetually in a split position after her doll self got “played with too hard.” Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) explains that Barbies are psychically connected to the children playing them, and so in order to correct these out-of-place crises, Barbie has to travel to the Real World and find that girl and help her assuage her concerns.

Barbie heads on a journey to the Real World, accompanied by Ken, who longs to prove himself to her. But when they arrive in the modern world (Los Angeles), they discover something jarring: the world is not, in fact, a feminist society in which women get to exercise (and be celebrated for) their skills and aptitudes, but… the opposite. Barbie herself grows very depressed, while Ken feels empowered, by this rift. Ken runs back to Barbie Land to tell the other Kens that “men rule the world” in reality while Barbie discovers that she’s unwittingly something of a villain there. She discovers, from a group of tween girls, that not only is Barbie not a feminist hero, but is also a controversial and outdated toy who has contributed to and participated in the creation of impossible, unhealthy, and problematic standards for women, not to mention the glorification of capitalism and the mass production environmentally-poisonous plastic. And she discovers Mattel, an FBI-style entity determined to keep the existence of the Avalon-like Barbie Land a secret.

While evading the Mattel G-Men, Barbie winds up meeting her playmate, who turns out not to be a child, but the mother of a child. She, Gloria (America Ferrera), has always loved Barbie, but her love for Barbie cannot override the frustrations and problems of her regular life, including a lack of professional and creative fulfillment (she’s a secretary at Mattel). But something happens when they’re together, and Barbie decides to bring her new friend and her Barbie-hating preteen daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) back to Barbie Land to help empower them. But when they get there, they discover that Ken has brought the idea of male supremacy back, taken over the paradise, and brainwashed all of the brilliant, accomplished Barbies into serving them and ornamenting their spaces.

Barbie isn’t a subtle movie, and that’s okay! Subtlety is overrated. It’s clear now, if it hasn’t been before, that Barbie slings many, many metaphors about the state of female existence in its current moment. Barbie is about a jealous, women-hating current that runs deep in male perspective. Ken is ultimately a bit of an incel (even though he’d be called a Chad BY the incels), and in Barbie we watch as all the progress, works, dreams of women are dismantled and erased and destroyed by men who need to feel like they control powerful women in order to feel powerful, themselves. It’s a movie that feels like it’s about Abortion Bans and the January 6th insurrection and our Post-Trump society just as it feels (sadly) timeless.

But even more insightful is what happens to Barbie when she realizes her world is a disaster. She grows depressed, begins to hate and doubt herself. She feels unattractive, unimportant, like a failure. Gerwig was influenced in writing the screenplay by the 1994 nonfiction book Reviving Ophelia, about the sudden, mass self-confidence and depression crisis that hits girls around puberty. “They’re funny and brash and confident, and then they just—stop,” she explained of the phenomenon to Vogue. “…All of a sudden, [girls think], Oh, I’m not good enough.”

Watching Barbie, this moment (when Robbie’s Barbie collapses into despair, feeling like a failure because she can’t fix the horrible things happening around her), was one of the most intuitive moments I’ve ever seen on film. Even more so is when Gloria comforts her, by acknowledging the horrible double-standards that make women feel this way, universally, delivering a heart-rending, passionate soliloquy that provides the film’s heart as well as its thesis statement. I cried a lot during the Barbie movie, but I really cried here.

Barbie not only understands what it’s like to be a woman, but has a lot of love for women, which is refreshing. It also has a lot of love for childhood, but it doesn’t allow the nostalgia for girlhood to muddle the empowerment of adult women. Barbie is a genuine masterpiece for its studies in making the intangible tangible, and this is epitomized by its magnificent production, set, and costume design.

The Barbie Dream Houses don’t have walls, just like in life. The Barbie World doesn’t come with food, just adhesive decals and plastic pieces. There is an extroardinary tactility, solidity to this world that is so reminiscent of playing with Barbies, like how McKinnon’s defaced Barbie almost always has her legs split apart. Watching the film, I remembered the feel and movement of these toys. There’s a Proust joke in Barbie, but I’m not joking when I’m saying that if Proust saw Barbie, he’d write another 1,000 pages. That’s how evocative Gerwig’s direction is. There are whole scenes in the movie that seem intended just to allow the audience to feel.

Robbie, who demonstrates tremendous physical comedy skills while also relaying depths of humanity, is wonderful as this torn Barbie. Gosling, whose relentless commitment to his character is astonishing, would be the film’s scene-stealer if Robbie wasn’t such a strong anchor. But Ferrera is the best part of the star-studded cast, a phenomenally real woman.

Barbie is so insightful in its symbolic intervention that when it returns to its Hero’s Journey/Barbie-vs. Mattel plot, it becomes a lot less satisfying. Mostly because, after watching ideas come to life, becoming reminded about the tethers to branding and commercial interests feels irrelevant and almost contradictory and even occasionally unpleasant. There’s a little too much humanization in the end, actually, partially of entities who might not deserve it, in a story that is, ultimately, about women. Things get messy and very, well, imperfect.

Still, I spent the nearly two-hours of Barbie noting how thoughtful and ambitious it was. Personally, I felt very seen and understood. I was moved and even felt a little appreciated, in a universal way. And that’s not an easy to do with a main character who is essentially a lump of plastic shaped like a person. But there is nothing fake, nothing false about Barbie. To Barbie, life may be plastic, but it’s also profound.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbGl0aHViLmNvbS9ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWdzLWJhcmJpZS1pcy1hLWZhc2NpbmF0aW5nLXNwZWN0YWN1bGFyLXBoaWxvc29waGljYWwtZXhwZXJpbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 13:00:36+00:00,‘Barbie’ crayon map triggers ban in Vietnam,"Warner Bros. highly anticipated movie 'Barbie,' has been banned in Vietnam due to controversial map drawing.","VIETNAM — Warner Bros.’s highly anticipated film “Barbie,” directed by Greta Gerwig is already seeing controversy. The film has not been granted a license for release in Vietnam. The “Barbie” map controversy surrounds a crayon-drawn map that includes a dashed line near Asia.

Barbie map controversy

Vi Kien Thanh, director of Vietnam’s Cinema Department, told a Vietnamese newspaper that “[They] do not grant license for the American movie ‘Barbie’ to release in Vietnam.” Thanh said it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line.

Pham Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry, made a statement saying that publications promoting the nine-dash line are not permitted to be released in Vietnam. She did not state the exact scene she was referencing.

The film was banned because of a cartoonish map depicting Asia. The map includes a line comprising eight dashes running into the sea, though no sea is labeled or specified on the map. The Vietnamese government believes the line is a reference to the nine-dashed line.

The nine-dash line is used by China to claim almost all of the South China Sea, according to BBC. The sovereignty of this territory is often contested by China and Vietnam.

According to BBC, an official in Vietnam called the lines on Barbie’s map an “offensive image,” comparing it to the nine-dash line.

Bill Hayton, who has authored several books on Vietnam and the South China Sea, told The New York Times he does not understand what the controversy is about. “The map in the film appears to bear no relation to a real map of the world,” Hayton said.

“This looks like Vietnam’s censors trying to demonstrate their patriotism and usefulness to the regime,” Hayton told the Times.

Warner Bros. response

“The map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing … the doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the ‘real world.’ It was not intended to make any type of statement,” a spokesperson for Warner Bros, the production company behind Barbie, told Variety magazine.

Representatives from the film would not comment on the map’s function in the movie’s plot. They’ve only said the map represents Barbie’s ‘journey to enlightenment,’ according to Variety.

2023-08-14 19:58:38+00:00,Will Hollywood Learn These 5 Lessons From ‘Barbie’?,"If studios greenlight more movies about toys, they’ll be missing the point. Greta Gerwig’s hit is about smart filmmaking, not brand awareness.","Over the past week and a half, Greta Gerwig’s comedy “Barbie” passed the billion-dollar mark at the global box office, and it won’t be long before it overtakes “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” to become 2023’s highest-grossing movie worldwide — a title it’s likely to hold onto. That’s a staggering achievement in so many ways: No movie directed by a woman has ever topped the yearly box office, and it’s been well over two decades since a live-action film without any significant action elements became the biggest movie of the year. (That’d be the Jim Carrey vehicle “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” which ruled 2000.)

But can the runaway success of “Barbie” reshape Hollywood? I’m too cynical to think studio executives will learn all the right lessons from it. Instead, they’ll probably just greenlight more movies about toys. Still, “Barbie” proved at least five things to be true, if decision makers are willing to think outside the pink box.

1. A summer movie can be smartly written

We count on summer movies to deliver spectacle, but how many also come with a witty, thoughtful script? Too often, big-budget blockbusters are rushed into production before the screenplay is finished, and even while shooting, they’re in a constant state of flux, with new writers clambering aboard to stitch everything into some sort of viable patchwork quilt.

“Barbie,” by contrast, feels totally thought through instead of frantically rewritten. Despite the outsize scale of the film, it still shares a distinctive comic sensibility and offhand intellectualism with “Frances Ha” and “Mistress America,” the two movies previously written by Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, and there are actual ideas at play here that have given “Barbie” a conversational shelf life far longer than most summer films. Though “Barbie” proves that a big movie can be both fun and thoughtful, that’s likely to happen only when a studio hires smart writers, resists sanding down their sensibilities, and gives them enough time and space to truly make the story sing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTQvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1ob2xseXdvb2QtbGVzc29ucy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Greta Gerwig refused to use CGI to make 'Barbie' actors' feet arched,Greta Gerwig shut down early discussions of using CGI to make the 'Barbie' actors' feet more arched: 'That's terrifying!',"Turns out, Greta Gerwig is less terrified of flaaaaaat feeeeet! than she is of CGI feet.

The director of the upcoming Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie said the studio entertained the idea of using CGI for the numerous Barbie actors to replicate their signature arched heels, but she immediately shut down the idea.

""There was a big discussion in the beginning,"" Gerwig said on Australian talk show The Project recently. ""Everyone said, 'Are you going to CGI all the feet?' And I thought, 'Oh god, no! That's terrifying! That's a nightmare.'""

""Also,"" she added, ""Margot has the nicest feet. She has these beautiful dancer feet. I was like, 'She should just hang onto that bar and do it just like this.'""

Robbie, also a producer on the movie, previously confirmed that the shot Gerwig referred to featured her real feet, explaining that she did hold onto a bar to achieve the scene. ""I really don't like it when someone else does my hands or feet in an insert shot,"" she said in a recent Time cover story.

Gerwig added on The Project that the scene ""felt like a Bat Signal,"" as did the typography of the giant B on the Barbie Land sign, to mark the introduction of the iconic doll. ""Globally it's known, but also we kind of share this collective of what Barbie means,"" she said. ""Even though it's this huge movie, it feels very personal to me. It was made by so many people who cared about it.""

In theaters July 21, Barbie follows Robbie's central titular character as she experiences an existential crisis, and thus embarks on a trip from Barbie Land to the real world for answers about all the strange things that have been happening in her life. The most alarming of all? Her feet are no longer arched, much to the terror of her fellow Barbies.

2023-08-18 11:27:20+00:00,"Why ‘Barbie’ is a rare phenomenon: Progress toward parity for women on movie screens has stalled, report finds","The USC report, published Thursday, found that 34.6% of speaking parts were female in the top 100 box-office hits of last year","August 18, 2023 04:57 pm | Updated 05:13 pm IST

A new study on inclusion in film shows just how much of a rarity “Barbie” is. For every woman as a speaking character in the most popular films of 2022, there were more than two men, according to report by University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.

The USC report, published Thursday, found that 34.6% of speaking parts were female in the top 100 box-office hits of last year. The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative has been annually tracking that and many other metrics since 2007.

And in its first such study in three years, USC researchers found that in many areas, progress toward parity on screen has stalled since the pandemic — and in some respects hasn't changed all that much since 14 years ago. In 2019, 34% of speaking characters were female. In 2008, it was 32.8%.

""It is clear that the entertainment industry has little desire or motivation to improve casting processes in a way that creates meaningful change for girls and women,” said Stacy L. Smith, founder and director of the Inclusion Initiative, in a statement. “The lack of progress is particularly disappointing following decades of activism and advocacy.”

In analyzing the top films in ticket sales, the report doesn't include the large amount of films produced for streaming platforms and smaller releases. But it does offer a snapshot of how Hollywood is evolving — or not.

And it comes on the heels of the enormous success of Greta Gerwig's “Barbie,” which has made $1.2 billion worldwide since opening last month and domestically has become the highest grossing movie ever from a female filmmaker. Last year, one in 10 of the biggest box-office films were directed by women, down from record rates in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Some findings in the study point to progress in inclusivity on screen. There are more female leading or co-leading roles in the top grossing movies than ever. Some 44% of such lead roles were girls or women in 2022, a historical high and more than double the rate of 2007 (20%).

Speaking characters from underrepresented ethnic groups have also made sizable gains. In 2022, Black, Hispanic, Asian and other non-white minorities accounted for 38.3% of speaking characters, nearly matching the U.S. population percentage of 41%. Most notably, Asian characters have gone from 3.4% of characters in 2007 to 15.9% last year, a movie year that culminated with the best picture win for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”

But other metrics show that the film industry regressed in some areas of diversity during the pandemic. In 2022, the top grossing movies featured 31% of leads from underrepresented ethnic groups, down from 37% in 2021. Out of those 100 2022 movies, 46 didn't include a Latino speaking character.

“These trends suggest that any improvement for people from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups is limited,” said Smith. “While it is encouraging to see changes for leading characters and for the Asian community, our data on invisibility suggests that there is still much more to be done to ensure that the diversity that exists in reality is portrayed on screen.”

Of the top 100 films in 2022, just 2.1% of speaking characters were LGBTQ+ — roughly the same number as a decade ago. Of the 100 films, 72 didn't feature a single LGBTQ+ character. Only one was nonbinary.

The number of characters with disabilities has also flatlined. In 2022, 1.9% of speaking characters were depicted with a disability. In 2015, the percentage was 2.4%.

With actors and screenwriters striking over fair pay, AI and other issues, Smith said Thursday's report should add to the demands of workers on screen and off in Hollywood.

“When people from these communities are rendered invisible both on screen and behind the camera, the need to ensure that every opportunity merits a living wage is essential. This cannot happen if people are not working at all,"" said Smith. “Hollywood has a long road ahead to address the exclusion still happening in the industry alongside the concerns actors and writers are bringing to the forefront.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMvd2h5LWJhcmJpZS1pcy1hLXJhcmUtcGhlbm9tZW5vbi1wcm9ncmVzcy10b3dhcmQtcGFyaXR5LWZvci13b21lbi1vbi1tb3ZpZS1zY3JlZW5zLWhhcy1zdGFsbGVkLXJlcG9ydC1maW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlNjcyMDkzODguZWNl0gGxAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21vdmllcy93aHktYmFyYmllLWlzLWEtcmFyZS1waGVub21lbm9uLXByb2dyZXNzLXRvd2FyZC1wYXJpdHktZm9yLXdvbWVuLW9uLW1vdmllLXNjcmVlbnMtaGFzLXN0YWxsZWQtcmVwb3J0LWZpbmRzL2FydGljbGU2NzIwOTM4OC5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 19:05:44+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Movie Gives Left and Right Another Battlefront, in Pink","Political figures of all types grabbed for the legs of a doll-turned-movie-turned-cultural moment, with predictable results.","“Obviously, the little girls that are going to see Barbie, none of them are going to have any idea what those dashes mean,” Mr. Cruz told Fox News. “This is really designed for the eyes of the Chinese censors, and they’re trying to kiss up to the Chinese Communist Party because they want to make money selling the movie.”

The response on the right is not a one-off. For a generation of conservative personalities, weaned on Andrew Breitbart’s much-cited observation that “politics is downstream of culture,” Hollywood and other ostensibly liberal bastions are to be confronted head-on, lest their leanings ensnare young voters without a fight.

Recent years have provided ample evidence, some on the right say, for a “go woke, go broke” view that progressivism is bad business. Last year’s apolitically patriotic “Top Gun: Maverick” was a smashing success, as was this year’s kid-friendly “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” By contrast, critics on the right contended that Disney’s remake of “The Little Mermaid,” with its title character portrayed by the Black actress Halle Bailey, failed to match its producers’ hopes. (Of course, there is no way to trace exactly what determines any movie’s success or failure, and many observers adhere to the screenwriter William Goldman’s axiom: “Nobody knows anything.”)

“Barbie” cannot be said to have gone broke. But its purported politics, conservatives have argued, did damage it by making it less entertaining — “a lecture,” in the words of The Federalist’s Rich Cromwell, “that self-identifies as a movie.”

Kyle Smith, a reviewer at The Wall Street Journal, complained that the film “contains more swipes at ‘the patriarchy’ than a year’s worth of Ms. magazine.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjQvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLW5ld3NvbS1nYWV0ei5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 19:24:55+00:00,Who is the old lady on the bench in 'Barbie'?,"The ""Barbie"" movie features a touching scene between Barbie (Margot Robbie) and an old lady on a bench. But who is the old lady? It's Ann Roth!","The best moment in the Barbie movie isn't in any of the musical montages, Ken serenades, or slumber parties; it's nestled quietly on a park bench.

In a scene teased by an early trailer, Barbie's (Margot Robbie) bombastically pink adventure quiets down for a moment when she sits next to an old woman on a bench. Barbie, who's feeling fragile after being brutally roasted by a teenage girl, turns to the old woman and softly says, ""You're beautiful."" The woman's response? ""I know."" Barbie's laughing through her tears. I'm laughing through my tears. Is it even a Greta Gerwig film if a woman didn't make you cry?

Credit: Screenshot YouTube/Warner Bros.

It's been largely speculated that the old lady on the bench is Barbara Handler, the daughter of Barbie inventor Ruth Handler and the doll's namesake. But the lady on the bench is actually played by Ann Roth, an Oscar-winning costume designer and a friend of Gerwig's. Roth's extensive film credits include three films with Gerwig's co-writer and real-life partner Noah Baumbach: Margot at the Wedding, While We're Young, and White Noise.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gerwig explained that she needed to cast an older actor for this small but poignant role, so she turned to her friend Roth, whom she described as a ""legend."" Gerwig also expressed her thoughts on the bench scene, which she thinks is ""the heart of the movie,"" and shared, ""It's a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way — it doesn't lead anywhere. And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, 'Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.' And I said, 'If I cut the scene, I don't know what this movie is about.'""

Barbie's bench scene is one of the most emotional moments in the film. It speaks volumes about what Barbie's been trying to do this whole time, which is to make women feel confident. And just when Barbie fears she's failed, a gorgeous stranger on a bench reminds her that sometimes we don't really need Barbie’s help. We can all do it on our own.

Barbie did not begin as a doll but as a kind of page-filler. In the summer of 1952, the German publisher Axel Springer was poised to print a new newspaper—a conservative tabloid based on the British gossip rags angling to compete with the great new medium of the age: television. But just as the first edition hit the presses, Springer and his staff faced a problem. Amid the pasting of pictures and inverted pyramids, the editors had ignored a narrow chasm on the broadsheet that was too small for a photo, but too large to leave blank. Springer needed something to fill the space, so he turned, at the last minute, to a cartoonist acquaintance. What he got was “Lilli”—a thin, blonde, and slightly austere woman who looked like a caricature of Marlene Dietrich. Lilli, in the original sketch, was visiting a psychic. The caption read: “Do you know the address of a tall, beautiful, rich man?”

Lilli was supposed to be a one-off, but she attracted a fan base nearly overnight. Readers wrote in about the svelte babe en masse. Springer and his staff decided to keep her on, and in two years, Lilli was omnipresent on merchandise—from postcards to champagne bottles to novelty perfume. She soon gained a third dimension and became a doll. The gag gift was mostly intended for men; a car ornament model made her the mid-century equivalent of truck nuts. But Lilli was also the paper’s public face; it was its most effective ad.

Interest spread across Europe. In Switzerland, an American toy maker named Ruth Handler was on vacation and spotted a Lilli doll in a small shop. Handler had been angling for an adult-shaped doll in the United States, and here was a figurine already fully formed. She tasked a deputy named Jack Ryan—a former Raytheon missile designer who moonlighted briefly as Zsa Zsa Gabor’s sixth husband—with sending a Lilli to a toy company in postwar Japan as the model for a similar product. The Stateside replica debuted in 1959 under a new name: Barbie. Handler’s company, Mattel, had more resources than Lilli’s manufacturer and better marketing; the doll soon eclipsed her continental predecessor and lodged so firmly in the American psyche that she seemed a symbol of the country itself.

Barbie had begun as a literal blank, and Mattel tried to maintain that blankness. Barbie had no age, no kids, no qualities anyone might mistake for a flaw. She gained some personal details: Her full name was Barbara Millicent Roberts. She was a teen model. She had a boyfriend named Ken Carson; sisters named Skipper, Stacie, and Kelly; and friends named Midge, Christie, and Teresa. When Barbie was licensed to a set of serial children’s books, readers learned that she went to high school in a small town called Willows. But soon details about Barbie’s specific biographical backstory seemed to disappear. In the 1980s, Mattel introduced numerous races, ethnicities, hairstyles, and builds—not as secondary characters but as various versions of “Barbie” herself. Barbie also began to work in a variety of professions: There was “Day to Night Barbie,” an executive who changed from business formal to club attire, in 1985 and “UNICEF Ambassador Barbie” in 1989. After the Gulf War broke out in late 1990, Barbie joined the Air Force. In the 1992 election cycle, she announced her campaign for president—the first candidate to run while also in high school. Her plasticity was both figurative and literal, a deliberately open-ended doll designed not to tell a story but to facilitate someone else’s. A 1985 tagline captures this aim for universal appeal: “We Girls Can Do Anything.” Popular ""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe → The Right to Speak for Ourselves The Right to Speak for Ourselves Feature / Mohammed El-Kurd The “Harvard Law Review” Refused to Run This Piece About Genocide in Gaza The “Harvard Law Review” Refused to Run This Piece About Genocide in Gaza Rabea Eghbariah Damn It, Joe Biden and Michelle Obama, Stop Rehabilitating George W.

In making Barbie, Greta Gerwig, therefore, needed to tell a story about an icon that purposefully did not have one. Gerwig’s approach: to literalize Barbie’s malleability in almost every absurd way. In Barbie Land, nearly every woman is a Barbie (as nearly every man is a Ken). Barbie’s blankness, in fact, becomes the butt of endless jokes: The protagonist’s name is “Stereotypical Barbie”; she drinks from empty cups; when Ken asks to spend the night, the pair puzzle over what they would even do (both have blanks where sex organs might be). But that emptiness also gets in the way of actually giving her an arc. Gerwig tries to give Barbie a challenge to overcome. She tries to let Barbie change. Eventually, she even makes Barbie into a human. But in the end, it is not Barbie but Ken, of all people, who proves the most compelling character, because it is Ken who is allowed to make real errors—ego, insecurity, longing, horrendous taste—and who, as a result, turns out to be the most human.

Barbie begins, appropriately, in a place called Barbie Land: a pink utopia, populated by women named Barbie, men named Ken, and occasional side characters from Mattel’s half-buried past: the pregnant doll Midge, her vibeless husband, Allan (known mainly as “Ken’s buddy”), and the sister Skipper who sprouts breasts on demand. The dolls are aware of the human world, but clearly have had some comms issues: They believe that, on Earth, “all the problems of feminism and inequality have been solved.” Barbie Land operates similarly. Women run all branches of government, win all its Nobel Prizes, and appear chiseled into a Barbie-fied Mount Rushmore.

Barbie’s ubiquity in Barbie Land means that her many iterations are differentiated by vocation. We meet, among others, President Barbie (Issa Rae), Doctor Barbie (Hari Nef), Mermaid Barbie (Dua Lipa), and the protagonist, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie). For this legion of gainfully employed Barbies, we are told, every day is a perfect day: They wake up in idyllic Dream Houses, drive exotic pink cars to well-remunerated jobs, dance at pristine clubs untouched by spilled beer, and spend each night at an ongoing sleepover. Life is less rosy for the Kens, who are uniformly introduced as “just Ken.” Ken “has a great day only if Barbie looks at him” and is otherwise doomed to existential inconsequence.

This fuchsia paradise seems undisturbed by pedestrian concerns until Stereotypical Barbie undergoes something of a crisis. For whatever reason, she begins to worry about death, develops sudden pockets of cellulite, and, most disturbing in this realm of high arches, acquires flat feet. The Barbies recommend that she seek answers from the town’s Boo Radley: a damaged-looking doll nicknamed “Weird Barbie” for her jagged hair, erratic makeup, and constant splits—attributed to a human owner who “played with her too hard.” Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) diagnoses Stereotypical Barbie with the same condition, advising that she venture to the human world and console her kid owner who is doing the damage. This sends Stereotypical Barbie on a prolonged road trip to the real world, unknowingly trailed by Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling), whose lack of a pituitary gland does not preclude his abiding (but unrequited) affection for Stereotypical Barbie.

To get to the real world, the two Stereotypes undergo an extensive voyage and several wardrobe changes—driving through cardboard deserts, swimming through cardboard oceans, floating through cardboard space—until they arrive by roller-skating through Earth’s portal (aptly, Venice Beach). The dolls get a dose of reality—aggressive stares, accidental shoplifting, multiple arrests—before Barbie ditches Ken to find her troubled kid. Her troubled kid, however, turns out not to be a kid at all. She is Gloria (America Ferrera), a depressed Mattel employee who has been drawing a range of more relatable Barbies with ordinary issues like cellulite and flat feet. When Gloria overhears Mattel’s all-male executives discussing Stereotypical Barbie’s flight from Barbie Land and their plot to put her “back in The Box,” she sets out to find Barbie and help her escape.

Left to his own devices, Ken meanwhile spends time in a place he believes to be an earthly Eden: Century City. There, he gets red-pilled: He discovers that, unlike Barbie Land, men run the real world. He returns home to tell the discontented Kens about male dominance, rallying the group into an over-accessorized mob. The Kens mount a notably January 6–ish coup, converting the Barbies’ mansions into “Mojo Dojo Casa Houses,” and taking over the Barbie-controlled Congress to rewrite the Constitution. They rename Barbie Land “Kendom.” Without any experience with patriarchy, the once-liberated Barbies all fall immediately in line, and it’s now up to Stereotypical Barbie and Gloria, who have arrived in Barbie Land, to deprogram them.

Until now, we’ve been on a wild goose chase of a film, full of absurd turns, several high-octane dance numbers, multiple digs at Mattel, and some almost Simpsons-like sight gags. But once Barbie and Gloria get back to Barbie Land, the joking mostly stops: They are there to help their fellow women emancipate themselves from the Ken world order. The pep talk they give, about the impossibility of being a woman, waffles from occasionally moving to meme-format observations on par with holding a “Male Tears” mug. Despite this rather trite strategy, the Stereotypical Barbie and Gloria succeed: A feel-good montage of empowerment monologues cures the Barbies’ brainwashing, and they band together to reclaim their queendom. The Barbies let the Kens drone on about The Godfather and play guitar for hours on end, only to neg them into feeling envious of other Kens, who start fighting among themselves, and get so distracted that they miss the vote on the new Constitution. The Barbies have restored their feminist ancien régime by playing to the Kens’ vulnerabilities. They make some modest changes to accommodate Ken rights and then return to an age of pink feminist utopianism.

If this all sounds a bit unbearable, that is because, well, it often is. But Gerwig’s sense of humor can often drive the movie forward even in its most exhausting moments. The film is funny—and often intentionally so. Barbie Land operates under an often hilariously plastic logic: Her home is open-air, like a bisected dollhouse; its rooms are tight, as the toy versions are 23 percent smaller than human scale. Closets resemble display boxes. Ken’s abs are constantly flexed. No one uses stairs; they float instead from floor to floor like a child has picked them up. Barbie can walk on water for the same reason Ken crashes into waves when he tries to surf—Barbie Land is liquidless. The cups are empty and the shoreline is ocean-less.

As an exercise in archival research and overdetermined excess, Barbie is a production design triumph. And if it had a slightly more Seinfeld “no hugs” sensibility—or at least scrapped some of the saccharine montages of frolicking girls and unconvincing speeches—it might have succeeded as a comic one too. But this is a toy movie where tears must be jerked, and the literal stiffness of the source material makes for a confusing set of arcs. Despite the marketing rollout touting an array of different Barbies, most of them are, as in the toy aisles, sidelined for the Stereotype. The absence of any character development or coherent world structure creates continuity issues too strange to laugh off: Are these women who have spent years under matriarchy so susceptible to subordination that they can be immediately brainwashed? And if aggressive doll play has real impact in the Barbie dimension, why aren’t half the Barbies beheaded, a fate so common it has its own field of academic study? What do the Mattel executives, who ultimately prove less evil than the boy-brained Kens, stand to gain from putting Barbie in “The Box”? The movie, perhaps rightly, assumes viewers will not overthink its internal logic; this is a toy story. But its appeals to the unexplained and absurd strain an overt desire for viewers to feel something for these dolls we don’t entirely understand.

Even our protagonist proves stilted. She is, as her name spells out, an empty archetype, whose sole personality comes from discovering the rough edges of the real world (“I don’t have a vagina,” she tells a group of catcalling construction workers). Barbie’s emotional arc hinges on a meeting with her maker, Ruth Handler. The former CEO, we learn, maintains a celestial office (depicted, curiously enough, as a quaint, mid-century kitchen) in Mattel’s otherwise soulless corporate structure and appears at the end to deus ex machina Barbie out of dollhood.. In real life, Handler was forced out of Mattel after being charged with fraud and remained exiled from the company into the mid-1990s, when she was rebranded as its sweet elder statesman. The movie treats her “tax problems” as a punch line, pitching her instead as the human heart of Mattel’s otherwise profit-driven operation. In the film’s climactic (and perhaps most phoned-in) scene, Handler materializes from nowhere and walks Barbie into an all-white other dimension, possibly Heaven, to discuss her desire to be human. “Humans have only one ending,” Handler cautions. “Ideas live forever.” (The irony here is perhaps unintentional: Handler is a ghost, and one the movie is reviving as Barbie’s benevolent leader.) But when Barbie insists, Handler reveals that she doesn’t need her help at all. Barbie, we learn, has had the power to transform herself all along—we girls can do anything, even alchemy.

There is a lot going on here—one could not accuse Gerwig of playing it safe. But perhaps when it comes to the film’s feminism, one does feel that in trying to say too much, Gerwig winds up not saying much at all. While women exist in a world with very few challenges and can easily overcome any resistance to their rule, it is Ken, whose status as an afterthought casts him an obvious underdog, who ends up having the most interesting, and funniest, arc—not Barbie or Handler or the myriad characters parroting critical theory. In the upended order of the Barbie Land universe, it is Ken who feels the most feminine. Ken is the one who can’t have a real career (his job is just “Beach”). Ken is sidelined for Barbie’s endless nights of homosocial bonding. Ken is the one who languishes outside the Barbie gaze. Ken does not “control the railways or flows of global commerce.” He also gets the best punch lines. Ken likewise offers the film’s only intelligible politics. Both he and Barbie recognize the flaws in their worlds, but he’s the only one who tries to do something about it.

The end product of Barbie is obviously a commercial, so maybe it’s not worth thinking too hard about the politics of a film that clearly is designed to give a languishing commodity more market interest and to extract even more value from Mattel’s existing IP. The movie tries to make light of Mattel’s omnipresence, not least by painting its executives as unsubtly sexist buffoons. But Gerwig refrains from fully indicting the bumbling bosses. In the end, they too care about little girls, at least enough to keep Ken from conquering Barbie Land. The gesture feels more like a strategy to make the company more appealing to a new generation suspicious of corporate influence. And while Barbie may become a person in Gerwig’s story, she has no meaningful narrative arc, no surprising twists and turns, no intelligible interior life. She remains a doll with nothing offensive, nothing to change. Her personality feels focus-grouped. Even as a hero in a film, she appears ready-made for retail testing, with little that might alienate the consumer. In the end, Ken, on whom much less money relies, gets to be a real character—with all the dumb mistakes and personal foibles that entails.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jdWx0dXJlL2JhcmJpZS1ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWctZmlsbS1yZXZpZXcv0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlbmF0aW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2N1bHR1cmUvYmFyYmllLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1maWxtLXJldmlldy90bmFtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

What is the 'Barbie' movie about?

Directed by Greta Gerwig, the Warner Bros. flick features Margot Robbie as the iconic Mattel doll and Ryan Gosling as her plastic partner, Ken. The star-studded cast also includes America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon, among others.

Marketed as a movie for people who love Barbie and also those who hate Barbie, the PG-13 comedy seems destined to be a summer hit. It follows Barbie and Ken on a journey of self-discovery in the ""real world"" after they are forced to leave the comfort of Barbieland.

Critic reviews have started to roll in, and so far the film adaptation of the iconic toy has been hailed a ""smart and hilarious delight"" and certified fresh by the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes.

Where can I watch it?

""Barbie"" officially releases in theaters nationwide Friday, July 21, but places like the Picture Show at SouthCoast Marketplace in Fall River have held early access screenings.

2023-07-07 15:35:12+00:00,Original ‘Barbie’ Writer Exited Sony’s Failed Movie Because ‘They Wanted a Girl-Boss Feminist Twist on Barbie’ and ‘That’s Not What Barbie Is’,"""Juno"" Oscar winner Diablo Cody was brought on to write Sony's ""Barbie"" movie, but the project failed.","When Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie’s “Barbie” finally opens in theaters later this month, it will mark the end of a long, long journey to get the iconic Mattel doll to the big screen. Sony Pictures originally had the rights to Barbie and spent years trying to get a movie off the ground. Actors such as Amy Schumer and Anne Hathaway came and went. Schumer said last month that she exited her “Barbie” movie because the script wasn’t “feminist and cool” enough.

Another talent that left “Barbie” during the film’s development at Sony was Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “Juno.” She exited the film in 2018 and told ScreenCrush at the time, “I was literally incapable of turning in a ‘Barbie’ draft. God knows I tried.”

Why was “Barbie” so hard to crack for an Oscar-winning talent? Cody reflected on the failed project in a new interview with GQ magazine.

“I think I know why I shit the bed,” Cody said. “When I was first hired for this, I don’t think the culture had not embraced the femme or the bimbo as valid feminist archetypes yet. If you look up ‘Barbie’ on TikTok you’ll find this wonderful subculture that celebrates the feminine, but in 2014, taking this skinny blonde white doll and making her into a heroine was a tall order.”

Sony’s plan to pair Cody’s idiosyncratic writing style with a crass comedian like Schumer didn’t work, the writer remembered. “That idea of an anti-Barbie made a lot of sense given the feminist rhetoric of 10 years ago,” Cody said. “I didn’t really have the freedom then to write something that was faithful to the iconography; they wanted a girl-boss feminist twist on Barbie, and I couldn’t figure it out because that’s not what Barbie is.”

Cody also said “The Lego Movie” loomed large over the development of Sony’s “Barbie” movie. The 2014 animated comedy was a massive critical and commercial hit for Warner Bros., grossing $468 million worldwide and landing Oscar nominations for best animated feature and best original song. “The Lego Movie” took a brilliant meta approach to bringing toys to the big screen, and Sony wanted to emulate that for Barbie.

“I heard endless references to ‘The Lego Movie’ in development,” Cody told GQ magazine, “and it created a problem for me because they had done it so well. Any time I came up with something meta, it was too much like what they had done. It was a roadblock for me, but now enough time has passed that they can just cast [‘The Lego Movie’ antagonist] Will Ferrell as the antagonist in a real-life Barbie movie and nobody cares.”

,Bobi Wine: The People's President movie review (2023),Arrives at a moment when strongman politics are in ascension around the world.,"This applies to the new documentary “Bobi Wine: The People’s President,” directed by Christopher Sharp and Moses Bwayo. Sharp is a second-generation Ugandan-born Englishman, and Bwayo, who also serves as one of the film’s cinematographers, is Ugandan. For five years, including inevitably the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, they shadowed and filmed the unlikely rise of Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu to a place of prominence in Ugandan politics. Kyagulanyi, performing under the name Bobi Wine, is a pop musician whose music (a blend of reggae, dancehall, and Ugandan kidandali) has made him a big name. However, Bobi Wine risks it all when he decides to enter politics, taking a seat in the Ugandan Parliament before deciding to run for president.

The incumbent is Yoweri Museveni, a septuagenarian war hero who took up arms against the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin only to become a de facto dictator himself after losing a presidential election and launching a civil war to take power. Museveni has ruled Uganda since 1986.

The filmmakers construct this documentary as a first-person account of Wine and his formidable wife, Barbie. Their unlikely courtship—a good girl from a middle-class family falling for a musician from the streets with no family to speak of—feels like something out of Old Hollywood. The differences between the two are the secret to this dynamic union, and Wine would probably have never transitioned from pop idol to statesman without her influence and counsel.

All dictators are, to some degree, creatures of the media, and every strongman’s worst nightmare is being challenged by a beloved entertainer. Museveni is threatened by Wine and uses his army and police to go to war with Wine’s National Unity Platform opposition party. Wine is arrested and brutalized, which temporarily forces him into exile as he tries to raise international awareness of Museveni’s abuse of power.

The documentary balances footage from the news (both Ugandan media and from abroad) with their footage from inside Wine’s inner circle to the violent clashes between Wine’s supporters and the army. The film is in many ways a spiritual sibling to Marshall Curry’s 2005 Oscar-nominated documentary “Street Fight,” which tells the story of (now-) U.S. Senator Cory Booker’s first failed attempt to become the Mayor of Newark as his campaign is smothered by incumbent Sharpe James who ruled Newark in ways strikingly similar to Museveni.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvYm9iaS13aW5lLXRoZS1wZW9wbGVzLXByZXNpZGVudC1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXctMjAyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Rob Thomas glad Matchbox 20's Push wasn't a joke in 'Barbie',"After having 'Kenough' of being an easy target in the '90s, Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas was glad to hear 'Push' wasn't the punchline in the pink and punchy 'Barbie' movie.","Barbie Land advisory: This article contains spoilers for Barbie.

The peppy pink pop of the Barbie soundtrack may be bejeweled with tracks like Dua Lipa's disco pop banger ""Dance the Night"" and hyperpop odyssey ""Speed Drive"" from Charli XCX, but there's still room for a little '90s alternative on the cotton candy confection. Case in point: Matchbox Twenty's 1996 hit ""Push,"" which Ken (Ryan Gosling) belts out on the beach, of all places.

Frontman Rob Thomas shared his thoughts on the song's inclusion in the film as well as director Greta Gerwig reaching out for permission for Gosling to re-record his own version.

""I want to preface this by saying that I thought it was hilarious. But in Bring It On, (Kirsten Dunst's character) has this douchey boyfriend,"" Thomas told USA Today in a July 21 interview. ""And there's a scene where he was in his dorm room with a Matchbox Twenty poster in the background. There was a whole period during the '90s where the more successful we got, the bigger target we were. We were an easy takedown. When I got the call for Barbie, they told me, 'Ken's by the fireside, he's playing the song and it's his favorite band.'""

But this didn't immediately quell Thomas's fears that the band wouldn't simply be the ""butt of the joke,"" though it was something he insisted he'd be ""fine with"" considering his thick skin. When he learned the true breadth of the scene, however, it cemented Gerwig as one of his ""crushes"" forever.

""To the point where I was on a plane one time and I called my wife, like, 'Baby, Greta Gerwig just came on the plane, oh my God.' So just the fact that it didn't diminish my crush of Greta, that's even better,"" he said.

When ""Push"" first shoved its way onto mainstream radio, it was met with less-than-enthusiastic feedback from some. It was mired in controversy after its debut thanks to its subject matter. Lyrics that feminist groups labeled as ""misogynistic"" at the time like ""I wanna push you around"" and ""I wanna take you for granted,"" prompted Thomas to defend the track. He instead insisted he had penned a ""panoramic song,"" when speaking to the Washington Post in 1998. ""The chorus is just the overall way I was looking at relationships at the time.""

Now, it seems ""Push"" has been given a new lease on life, especially as audiences seem to have a brand new appreciation for the track. As Thomas recalls, Atlantic Records' Julie Greenwald reassured him that, after seeing the movie, ""You come out of it loving Ken and loving 'Push."" Making audiences fall in love with another decades-old song with a completely new interpretation? It looks like there's truly nothing Barbie can't do.

,Todd Haynes' infinitely weirder Barbie movie about Karen Carpenter,"Before Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' there was Todd Haynes' infinitely weirder Barbie movie about Karen Carpenter. 'Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story' has been illicitly popping up here and there since the director premiered it in 1987.","Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie may be poised to walk way with the summer box office — in an invisible heel, no less — but she's tip-toeing in the footprints of giants.

Back in 1987, when he was an an MFA student at Bard College, Todd Haynes co-wrote (with Cynthia Schneider) and directed Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, an experimental biographical short about the last 17 years of the iconic singer's life as she struggled with, and was ultimately consumed by, anorexia — using Barbie dolls.

Both Mattel and the Carpenter family had their own disputes with Haynes' film, for different reasons.

Indie producer Christine Vachon, who received a ""Special Thanks"" from Haynes for Superstar, told the audience at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, via Deadline, that Mattel paid a visit to their office when the film was released, but Haynes was one Barbie-toed step ahead of them.

""Todd bought all those dolls in garage sales,"" Vachon said. ""They were Barbie rip-offs, so he was able to prove to Mattel that it was an off-brand. That it wasn't Barbie, but it was what you got if your parents couldn't afford Barbie.""

With that bullet dodged, Haynes was free to get struck by another from Richard Carpenter, Karen's brother and bandmate, for the use of the Carpenters' music. Haynes didn't bother to seek permission for the songs he used in the film because, according to Vachon, ""he didn't expect the film to blow up the way it did.""

Richard Carpenter, who was upset at his and his family's portrayal in Superstar, sued Haynes and won for failing to obtain the proper rights to the music, thus blocking any potential theatrical release of the film. Still, that hasn't kept Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story from obtaining cult status.

""It pops up on YouTube all the time. It's kind of like Whac-A-Mole. It pops up and gets taken down. Pops up again and gets taken down, so you can almost certainly find it,"" Vachon said. ""And now it's been restored. There's a wonderful version that keeps popping up and it's the true director's cut.""

Haynes spoke with EW last year about Superstar, and seemed confident that its eventual public release is ""going to happen — it will happen, yeah.""

""There have been some legal opinions written about the film that seem favorable to a way through. But there's a lot more work that I need to do that I haven't had time to, which is annotate the film and provide all of the sources of information and so forth,"" Haynes told EW.

""It's been shown a couple of times, not announced publicly, and not for any fee, not for any ticket, under the terms of its cease and desist,"" Haynes continued. ""But it has been remastered by UCLA and Sundance a couple years ago, and it looks so beautiful. Every time I see it now, I'm just like, Oh, man, I'm so lucky that we have this version out there.""

But until Superstar is made widely available, Margot Robbie and co. will just have to suffice when it hits theaters on July 21.

2023-08-10 13:54:06.008000+00:00,Barbie and Ken Baby Name Searches Surge Amid Movie's Success,Greta Gerwig's Barbie has birthed a cultural phenomenon that may have found some parents considering naming their babies after the movie's eponymous doll or her Ken-panion.,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie has birthed a cultural phenomenon that may have found some parents considering naming their babies after the movie's eponymous doll or her Ken-panion.

Popular baby-naming website Nameberry told People that searches for the name ""Barbie"" (short for Barbara) have increased by a whopping 603% since the movie's first trailer debuted online, while page views for the moniker ""Ken"" (diminutive of Kenneth) have also shot up on the site, with users causing a 293% surge.

Barbie currently ranks at 1,896 on the list of popular baby girl names, while Kenneth is in the 113th spot on the charts for top baby boy names. The rising popularity of both of these names could very well lead to ""Hi Barbie"" and ""Hi Ken"" exchanges in real life. However, these searches do not reflect what ends up on a birth certificate.

""Barbie and Ken are piquing parents' interest, but this doesn't mean that will translate into actual usage,"" Nameberry Editor-in-Chief Sophie Kihm said. ""Barbie and Ken are both dated names that aren't due to comeback yet, so while there may be a slight bump from the movie, neither will be among the most popular baby names of 2023.""

In the movie, Margot Robbie portrays the main Barbie and Ryan Gosling stars as the lead Ken doll, with several other notable actors also stepping outside of the toybox to ultimately discover that life is not all about blowout parties, beach hangouts, and rollerblading dates. There are actually a lot of mundane tasks and appointments.

Barbie has broken all kinds of records since debuting on July 21 as one part of the 'Barbenheimer' experience. The movie earned rave reviews from fans and critics, with IGN's own review describing it as a ""hyper-femme roller-coaster ride"" that provides ""a masterful exploration of femininity and the pressures of perfection"".

2023-08-02 21:05:03+00:00,Daily Wire Host Michael Knowles Genuinely Loved the ‘Barbie’ Movie: Ben Shapiro ‘Is Completely Wrong’ (Video),"Michael Knowles openly professes a long laundry list of conservative beliefs -- and a gushing love for Greta Gerwig and the ""Barbie"" movie.","Michael Knowles, the former Rush Limbaugh guest host and longtime Daily Wire right-wing staple, openly professes a long laundry list of conservative beliefs, from opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion to total support of Donald Trump and a gushing love for Greta Gerwig and the “Barbie” movie.

Wait – what?

That’s right: Knowles not only sincerely called Greta Gerwig a “genius director,” but flat-out said his boss Ben Shapiro is “completely” wrong about the Warner Bros. smash hit – which he called a “conservative” movie.

“I left the movie a lot more optimistic about the culture,” Knowles said Wednesday on “The Michael Knolwes Show,” and with not even the least bit of irony.

“‘Barbie’ is great,” he said. “Ben is completely wrong. A lot of conservatives, mostly who haven’t seen the movie, are wrong to think it’s terrible and woke. The movie is splitting the right. I’ve noticed that a lot of the conservative, traditional, kind of hardcore right-wingers really like ‘Barbie.’”

In fact, Knowles said The Daily Wire asked him to go see it specifically because of Shapiro’s harsh – and harshly criticized – critique.

“They said OK, see it and see if you agree or disagree with Ben because it’s probably going to come up on the show,” Knowles said. “I did not watch or read any reviews before the movie. I saw that Ben hated it and saw the little clip of him throwing the Barbies and setting them on fire in the trash.”

But he also said he saw some of his favorite fellow conservatives praising the film, and “wanted to go in with a totally fresh slate, not colored by anyone else’s views,” and as a big fan of Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” felt he might even be primed to like it.

Boy did he ever. Knowles even went as far as to say that “It’s not even particularly ambiguous that Barbie is a conservative movie,” suggesting it had “strongly anti-feminist moments – clearly intentional and clearly very precise.”

The truth is, no film becomes an $800 million-and-counting global box office smash – and the biggest hit of summer with weeks left to go – by aggressively catering to only one half of the population’s political sensibilities. Gerwig is too smart and nuanced to make that mistake, and Knowles’ seemingly genuine love for the film – even if he genuinely thinks it’s got a “conservative” message – makes that case all by itself.

“She says the word ‘patriarchy’ like a dozen times in there – that’s a joke – that’s a punchline,” he said. “In order to cope with the craziness of this world we just make things up – like Barbie – we make things up like patriarchy. Does this mean we make things up like the actual structure of the patriarchy that controls everything, or we make things up like the concept of the patriarchy just like the concept of Barbie? I think it’s the latter, and Greta Gerwig an interviews has said everything in this movie is intended to operate on two levels.”

You can listen and watch Knowles make his entire case in the video above.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2RhaWx5LXdpcmUtbWljaGFlbC1rbm93bGVzLWxvdmVkLWJhcmJpZS1iZW4tc2hhcGlyby13cm9uZy12aWRlby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-20 15:49:00+00:00,"Pink Corvette Only a Bit Player in Big, Bright Barbie Movie","Ken can also be seen driving a massive GMC Hummer, and they both briefly enjoy a VW Camper van.","“Why am I seeing a review of Barbie in my beloved Autoweek?” you demand. “I want to read about AJ Foyt, Don ‘Big Daddy’ Garlits, and carburetors.”

It’s here because there’s a Corvette in the movie! In fact, all the Barbies in Barbieland own and drive Corvettes. And who deosn’t love Corvettes? These are somewhat stylized, completely modified, shortened C1 Corvettes with back seats. And Barbie’s Corvette serves as the vehicle in which she escapes Barbieland to go out in the real world.

But is the presence of a small fleet of what may be 1958 Corvette-inspired movie cars enough to warrant plunking down $16 to go see the nearly two-hour movie when it opens worldwide on Friday, July 21? Not just for the Corvettes, no.

The real, plastic Barbie and her Corvette. Warner Bros.

Using Hollywood insider connections, I got to see the entire movie last night, and I kept you, the reader, in mind the whole time. And frankly speaking, while you will almost certainly get a kick out of the Corvettes, especially when Margot Robbie barrel rolls one of them, it’s entirely possible you would not like the movie as a whole. But that’s just based on armchair psychographics of reader comments for numerous other stories. Judging by those, you guys love: Corvettes, whatever car you had in high school, whatever car you own now, all three generations of Earnhardts, everything Tony Stewart does, and the complexities of the Ford nine-inch rear end. Some of the movie’s themes might exceed the parameters of those subjects. So go see Mission Impossible: Tax Audit instead. Because most of the second half of the movie has to do with issues that may grate on your various sensitivities.

If you’re still reading, then you at least want to find out what those sensitivities are. I did. In addition to the Vettes, I was drawn to the movie by the very entertaining trailers that make it look like an existentialist sendup of a beloved child’s toy aimed at girls as seen through modern feminist ideologies. Take this perfect doll and plunk her into a modern reality she has never encountered, make her human, with human feelings and human complexities, instead of just being 11-and-a-half-inches of plastic perfection.

Leveraging Intellectual Properties From Barbie to Hot Wheels, Mattel Is Making Movies

It starts out like the fun world we see in the trailers: Every day in Barbieland is perfect, every Barbie is perfect, every Barbie friendship is perfect. Then, real human thoughts intrude on Barbieland. She thinks about death, cellulite, and why she has to wear high heels all the time. Which sends her on a journey of self-discovery. She goes to the real world, with decidedly imperfect humans and where no day is exactly like the other, as it was in Barbieland. Ken tags along, learns the word “patriarchy,” and starts to see that he doesn’t have to be just a boy toy anymore. Everyone is liberated!

Audience reactions to the movie’s existential scenes will likely be drawn along gender lines. When the Mattel employee played by America Ferrera is describing the difficulties thrust upon women by Barbie’s perfection, many in the audience cheered—there was one, “You go girl!” But others might be less enthusiastic about this teaching moment. The plot goes from the fun, happy Barbieland of the movie trailers into an inside view of the role gender inflicts on half the population.

Or is that a vast oversimplification? Maybe you should go see it. Tell us what you thought of it in the comments below. There’s a lot more going on here than just the Corvettes. But the Corvettes are cool.

THIS JUST IN: Warner Bros. just responded to a list of questions we sent in about the Barbie Corvette. We got answers from Nico Ferrari (great name!) who runs ‘Picture Vehicles,’ the company that worked on all the vehicles in the film. Who knew it was remote-controlled?

Autoweek: How did you choose the Corvette to be Barbie's car? Were any other cars considered? She has been associated with many different models over the years, from an Austin-Healey to a Ferrari.

Nico Ferrari: Truth is, a decision of this magnitude involves a huge element of product placement discussions with multiple manufacturers. Other vehicles were considered, but the relationship with Corvette was the most attractive from all angles.

AW: Does the car in the movie actually drive?

NF: Yes, but not by the driver inside! The car was driven remotely by an operator using a VR headset! This was felt the safest option to allow Margot to fully express herself in the vehicle without having to worry about controlling the vehicle.

Two of the five Corvettes made for the movie by Picture Vehicles. Warner Bros.

AW: How did you build it? Is it on the frame rails of another car or is it all a unique platform?

NF: A lot of hard work from an amazing crew! Nothing on the car is ‘off the shelf.' Everything, including the chassis and the body had to be custom made. There are no components from an existing car on the Barbie car we built. It wasn't possible to use anything from a real world car as it would all be too big! The Barbie car is 23% smaller than the original Corvette, so the whole car had to be drawn, manufactured and installed to create the finished piece!

AW: What powers it? I assume it's a small electric motor? Is it front wheel-drive or rear wheel-drive?

NF: A small electric motor, similar to the type found in a golf buggy. Direct drive to a rear differential to power the rear wheels! Very simple, very easy! Some hidden 12volt batteries from a fork lift hidden under the rear passenger seat!

AW: Does Barbie - Margot - actually drive it, as in step on an accelerator pedal and steer, or is it on a rail of some sort?

NF: It cannot be operated from inside the car, the only way to move it is the VR remote system which was installed by the SFX (Special Effects) team. It doesn’t even have fake pedals inside, just a steering wheel!

They could have titled it, 50 Shades of Pink. Haha. Warner Bros.

AW: Is there only one or were there several cars for different scenes?

NF: In total, we made 5. Margot’s never changed and was a different shade of pink to two other cars which were a darker more vibrant pink. We also made a yellow and a blue. The blue car was the one we wrapped in Ken’s Kendom graphic with the flames.

AW: Is there a motor home in the movie? Does that drive?

NF: No motorhome, but two ambulances. One for when Ken has his accident on the beach and ‘Weird Barbie’ has an ambulance to use when she’s collecting the Barbie’s for reprogramming. These are based on the same system and technology as the Barbie cars!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9jYXItbGlmZS9hNDQ1OTU1NTEvcGluay1jb3J2ZXR0ZS1iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Kate McKinnon didn't do those Barbie splits or cartwheels,The scene-stealer of Greta Gerwig's stacked 'Barbie' cast? Kate McKinnon's fake legs. The 'SNL' alum reveals how she did those splits and cartwheels as Weird Barbie.,"Barbie Land advisory: This article contains minor spoilers for Barbie.

While much of the Barbie attention has been on stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the real scene-stealer is Kate McKinnon's fake leg.

In a clever nod to the Mattel dolls' bendy limbs, McKinnon's ""legs"" are all over the place throughout the pastel pink film, whether she's doing the splits or casually resting one leg against the exterior of her eclectic and colorful dreamhouse. And while the Saturday Night Live alum excels at physical and slapstick comedy, she reveals that, no, she is not actually flexible enough to get in those positions or do cartwheels as the delightfully eccentric Weird Barbie.

""Can't do that,"" she quips while in conversation with director Greta Gerwig and her costars for EW's Around the Table (above). ""So that was a fake leg, and a heavy one.""

The secret to achieving those shots so McKinnon could retain her balance? No, not CGI, but holes carved into the walls and flooring, masterminded by production designer Sarah Greenwood.

""Sarah who did the set design was like, 'I've made all these holes in the wall where she can put her real leg in, and then we'll rig the other leg up,'"" Gerwig explains. ""It was like a practical effect."" In one scene with Weird Barbie doing the splits, McKinnon's legs were hidden within a secret compartment while she had ""two fake legs on the side,"" the director reveals.

It's during the chat that America Ferrera, who plays human Gloria, learns that her costar didn't actually do those acrobatic movements. Issa Rae, who plays Barbie Land president, gives McKinnon's convincing performance the presidential seal of approval: ""Every single person asked if that was your leg, and so the way that you sold that, you should be proud,"" the Insecure star says.

As for crafting Weird Barbie's disheveled look, ""every square millimeter was so finely considered,"" McKinnon says. With her unkempt, chopped-up hair and face marked by colorful squiggly lines, Weird Barbie represents all of the dolls who have been ""played with too much"" — and in some instances, mutilated by their humans. (Kids, man.) ""There was so much philosophy and thought behind it,"" McKinnon says. With hair and makeup artist Ivana Primorac, ""We talked a lot about what this sort of Barbie who had been played with and burned and drawn on would look like,"" McKinnon shares. ""I just pulled a bunch of pictures off the internet. I think I typed in, like, 'effed up doll.'""

Many of these ""effed up"" dolls would typically end up naked, she explains, with their outfits strewn across the carpeted living room floor of homes across suburbia and apartment dwellings alike. But of course, McKinnon couldn't be nude, so the costume department, led by designer Jacqueline Durran, landed on a pink whimsical baby doll dress. One note she received from Gerwig was that nothing about Weird Barbie was dirty. ""There's no dirt,"" McKinnon observes. ""I thought I was in rags or something and you were like, 'No, it's elevated.'""

,Tom Felton jokes about not getting 'Barbie' callback,Does Draco Malfoy have Kenergy? 'Harry Potter' star Tom Felton joked about being 'kind of pissed' that he didn't get a callback for 'Barbie.',"Could Ken ever be a Slytherin?

Harry Potter star Tom Felton made a pretty compelling case Wednesday with a humorous Instagram post comparing his devious Hogwarts alter ego, Draco Malfoy, to Ryan Gosling's equally blond himbo Ken in the new Barbie movie.

The split photo features Draco on one side sporting his black and green Slytherin attire, platinum locks, and an unimpressed expression; on the other side is a similarly scowling Ken, wearing a jacket adorned with the letter K and holding a sparkly wine glass.

""Kind of pissed I never got a callback,"" Felton, 35, wrote in the caption. He also added the hashtag ""#sLYTHERKen.""

Felton's tongue-in-cheek post got the comments section going with comparisons between Malfoy and the famous Mattel doll. Fans were quick to agree with Felton's insistence that he and Gosling as their respective characters channeled some similar vibes.

""You're Harry's ken,"" one follower commented.

Another bestowed a nickname on Felton: ""DraKen.""

But while the two may strike some of the same poses, their two personalities couldn't be more different.

Gosling has been promoting his particular brand of ""Kenergy"" throughout the many stops on the Barbie press tour, highlighting Ken's affable demeanor and effervescence. Draco, of course, has always been better known for his scheming ways and sour attitude.

In any case, moviegoers will be able to decide for themselves whether Felton would have made a good Ken when Barbie hits theaters Friday.

,Get a first look at John Cena as Mermaid Ken in Barbie,John Cena shared some insights on the 'Barbie' movie in a behind-the-scenes featurette that offers the first look at his Mermaid Ken.,"This Ken is a mermaid with billowing blond hair.

In the behind-the-scenes Barbie featurette above, which offers the first look at John Cena wearing his ""Kenmaid"" costume, the pro wrestler turned actor says he was ""blown away with the concept"" of the film from director Greta Gerwig, adding that he believes the movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling will be one that ""all audiences enjoy.""

""I think it's going to be a movie that evokes conversation,"" Cena, 46, said. ""And I think it's going to be beautifully visually appealing. I think the audience will walk away with a mixed bag of opinions, which I think is the greatest form of entertainment. When you have one universal feel about a project, it's not like that's bad, but when people can get into a fiery debate about something, I think that's good.""

Cena plays one of the various Kens and Barbies in Barbie Land, the pink utopia at the center of the film. Dua Lipa, who penned and performs the first single, ""Dance the Night,"" plays a Mermaid Barbie opposite Cena's Merman Ken. Other Barbies and Kens are portrayed by Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Kingsley Ben-Adir, and Scott Evans, to name a few.

Cena previously revealed that his casting was a ""happy accident,"" as he had been filming Fast X right across the street from Barbie and pitched himself to star and producer Robbie for a cameo role. ""I haven't worked with Margot before,"" Cena told Today back in May. ""Fast X was filming across the street from Barbie, and [she asked], 'Why don't you do Barbie?' I said, 'I've been trying!' And Margot makes a lot of the decisions for that and I said, 'Well, I'll do whatever you need.'""

He continued, ""I think Barbie and Fast X share a lot of parallels. The Barbie cast list is amazing. The Fast X cast list is amazing. It was a chance to [say], 'Hey, would you guys be willing to have me if I could do something?'""

Barbie arrives in theaters July 21. Watch the clip with Cena above.

2023-08-14 18:59:39+00:00,‘Barbie’s’ Big Payday: Margot Robbie Will Earn $50 Million in Salary and Box Office Bonuses (EXCLUSIVE),Margot Robbie will earn $50 million in salary and box office bonuses for her role in 'Barbie.',"Margot Robbie is being richly rewarded for her key role in bringing “Barbie” to the big screen. The star and producer behind the summer’s biggest hit stands to make roughly $50 million in salary and box office bonuses, according to three individuals with knowledge of her deal.

“Barbie” director and co-writer Greta Gerwig will also likely receive bonuses because of the film’s outsized success. “Barbie” has earned an astonishing $526.3 million at the domestic box office since it opened a month ago, as well as $657.6 million at the international box office. That comes out to $1.18 billion globally — and that figure should keep climbing given that “Barbie” is still topping box office charts. The film is now the second highest-grossing release in the history of Warner Bros., behind “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.” It’s also the highest-grossing film ever from a female director, overtaking the previous record holder, “Frozen II,” which was co-directed by Jennifer Lee.

In addition to bringing the popular children’s toy to glittering life, Robbie produced the film through her production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, which she founded in 2014 with her now-husband, Tom Ackerley, and friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. The goal of the company was to tell women’s stories on screen and support women creators behind the scenes. Its slate of projects includes the Oscar-winning “Promising Young Woman,” the superhero sequel “Birds of Prey” and the Netflix series “Maid.”

Robbie has been nominated for two Academy Awards for her performances in “I, Tonya” and “Bombshell.” She first came to prominence in Martin Scorsese’s “Wolf of Wall Street” and scored commercial hits with “Suicide Squad” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” But none of those films has come close to achieving the lofty box office heights of “Barbie,” which is shaping up to be one of the bigger blockbusters in movie history.

Warner Bros. declined to comment and a representative for Robbie had no comment.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLXBheS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXNhbGFyeS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJvbnVzZXMtMTIzNTY5NTU2My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,You can buy Ryan Gosling's 'I am Kenough' hoodie from Barbie,Ryan Gosling's tie-dye 'I am Kenough' hoodie from 'Barbie' is available for purchase.,"He's just Ken (and he's enough).

Ryan Gosling's ""I am Kenough"" tie-dye sherpa hoodie from Barbie is available to shop on Mattel's merch website. Up for pre-order for $60, the hoodie is set to ship around Sept. 29, just in time for sweater weather.

If you were one of the bevy of Barbs who came out opening weekend, then you know Gosling sports the cozy hoodie towards the end of the film. The real world-corrupted Ken comes to the realization that he'll have to figure out who he is without Barbie (Margot Robbie). Hence the colorful wardrobe change.

The ""I am Kenough"" merch also come in the forms of a coffee cup, tie-dye t-shirt, and baseball cap.

The film directed Greta Gerwig follows Robbie's doll as she malfunctions and experiences a very human existential crisis. At the weekend box office, the star-studded musical comedy opened with a massive $155 million, making it the biggest debut for a female director since Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's Captain Marvel ($153 million) in 2019. Come Monday morning, Barbie had the biggest opening weekend of the year with $162 million.

The Oscar campaign for Gosling has already begun, with many moviegoers heralding his subversive performance and dazzling musical moments. The La La Land star performs not just one but two musical numbers: a cover of Matchbox Twenty's ""Push"" and the original song ""I'm Just Ken."" During EW's Around the Table with Gerwig and the cast (conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike), Gosling said he had to ""make peace"" with his child actor past to play the character.

""At a certain point, I thought I had left that kid behind, and I realized that I needed his help to make this movie,"" said Gosling, who was a former All New Mickey Mouse Club cast member during the '90s. ""So I had to go back and make peace with him and ask for his help. It was good for me.""

Of harnessing his inner Kenergy, he added, ""It was like, at one moment I was a human male in my backyard picking up a Ken doll, and then somehow magically I had become that doll and I was being picked up by Greta Gerwig, and the only way to become human again was to just follow her very specific directions.""

Barbie is now playing in theaters.

2023-07-24 14:00:01+00:00,"Box Office Stunner: ‘Barbie’ Opens to Staggering $162M, ‘Oppenheimer’ Snags $82.4M","Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie' opened to a record $155M at the domestic box office, followed by Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' with a strong $80.","The summer box office just went nuclear.
Filmmaker Greta Gerwig‘s female-fueled Barbie opened to a historic $162 million domestically, a threshold usually reserved for male-driven superhero fare or marquee IP, such as the final Harry Potter movie. It came in well ahead of an expected $90 million to $110 million and helped fuel one of the biggest weekends in history. And the final figure of $162 million was even ahead of Sunday’s already-stupendous $155 million.
Barbie — which brings to life Mattel’s iconic fashion doll — is also strutting to big numbers overseas. The pic launched to an impressive $194.3 from 70 markets for a dazzling global debut of $356.3 million against a $145 million production budget (similar to domestic, Monday actuals were ahead of Sunday estimates). It scored the biggest opening ever for a WB title in major markets, including Mexico ($22.3 million), Brazil ($15.9 million) and Australia ($14.6 million). The U.K. led with $22.9 million, the biggest showing for the studio since the pandemic. Barbie wasn’t expected to make a big splash in Asian markets, although it did do better than expected in China, with $8.2 million.
In North America, Barbie scored the biggest domestic start ever for a movie directed by a woman, solo or otherwise. The solo crown previously belonged to Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman, which started off with $103.3 million domestically in 2017. In 2019, the Anna Boden- and Ryan Fleck-directed Captain Marvel opened to $153 million.
Barbie also set a slew of other records, including landing the top opening of 2023 to date, ahead of The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($146.3 million). The next closest 2023 launch belonged to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($120.7 million), followed by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($118.4 million) and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($106.9 million). Otherwise, many releases haven’t been able to inch past the $100 million mark.
It also marks the biggest opening for Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the biggest three-day opening for a movie based on a toy — eclipsing Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($115.9 million) — and Warners’ biggest opening for a non-DC pic or a sequel.
Gerwig’s film towered over Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer, the weekend’s other new wide release.
Not that Oppenheimer, from Universal, is any slouch. The three-hour, R-rated historical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the making of the atomic bomb likewise came in well ahead of expectations with $82.4 million (that’s up from Sunday’s estimate of $80.5 million). That’s the filmmaker’s third-biggest domestic debut behind The Dark Knight Rises ($160.9 million) and The Dark Knight ($158.4 million), not adjusted for inflation. It also will come in ahead of recent summer pics including The Flash, Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Barbie is skewing heavily female, or 68 percent, while Oppenheimer is male-dominated (64 percent). The performance of Oppenheimer was almost more surprising to some than Barbie, considering its running time and topic.
Other stats: Oppenheimer ranks as the third-biggest opening ever for a biographical film in North America behind American Sniper ($89.3 million) and The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million), not adjusted for inflation.
Overseas, Oppenheimer launched with a strong $98 million from 78 markets, up from Sunday’s estimate of $93.7 million. The film was Nolan’s biggest non-superhero opening in no fewer than 55 markets. The film’s global start is $180.4 million against a $100 million production budget.
Heading into the weekend, tracking suggested Nolan’s film would start off with a solid $50 million domestically.
The one-two punch of Barbie and Oppenheimer — a phenomenon dubbed “Barbenheimer” — was a needed boost for moviegoing and the box office, which has yet to recover fully from the pandemic. This will be the first three-day weekend in history when one movie earns $100 million or more and another $50 million or more.
Revenue-wise, this is the fourth-biggest weekend of all time and the biggest since Avengers: Endgame, according to Comscore, with combined ticket sales hitting $311.1 million in a rare feat. The sizzling box office is a welcome respite from the ongoing writers and actors strike, which has brought Hollywood to a standstill and sparked worry among theaters owners that studios will begin moving their fall and winter releases if actors can’t promote their films.
Both Barbie and Oppenheimer were graced with A CinemaScores from audiences in the U.S., and their critics’ scores on Rotten Tomatoes store aren’t far apart — 90 percent versus 93 percent, respectively.
Cinemark, one of the country’s largest theater circuits, said the two films fueled the exhibitor’s biggest summer weekend of all time.
“People love coming together to experience great storytelling in a movie theater, as proven yet again by the sheer volume of consumers who visited our locations to see Barbie and Oppenheimer during opening weekend,” said Cinemark chief marketing and content officer Wanda Gierhart Fearing. “It appears Barbie actually is everything, and Christopher Nolan fans turned out in droves to see his newest masterpiece in the larger-than-life theatrical format that he intended. Congratulations to our studio partners, as well as the entire creative community for delivering films that generate these record-breaking results.”
Barbenheimer isn’t making life easy for Tom Cruise starrer Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One. The film tumbled a steep 65 percent to $19.4 million for a domestic total of $118.6 million. It held up better overseas, where it earned another $55 million from 72 markets for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally.
Paramount’s seventh Mission: Impossible film had to contend with losing Imax screens to Oppenheimer in addition to losing other premium large format screens to either Oppenheimer or Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and premium large-format screens is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line.
Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom enjoyed another strong weekend. And, in the U.S., it beat narrowly Dead Reckoning with $19.9 million for a cume of $124.4 million, ahead of MI7.
Sound of Freedom stars The Passion of the Christ’s Jim Caviezel as the real-life Tim Ballard, who worked as an agent for the Department of Homeland Security before embarking on his own quest to bring child traffickers to justice. While the conservative-leaning Sound of Freedom has been discussed on QAnon message boards, Angel says it isn’t a QAnon movie. In late 2021, Caviezel spoke at a QAnon convention in Las Vegas, where he invoked the QAnon slogan, “The storm is upon us.”

2023-07-23 15:00:22+00:00,"'Barbenheimer' tops $235 million in domestic debut, eyes second-highest box office weekend ever","""Barbenheimer"" exploded over the weekend, generating an estimated $235.5 million in ticket sales and reinvigorating the domestic box office.","""I don't think anyone could have reasonably predicted this kind of confluence between 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie,'"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""If you're going to a theater right now, the communal experience is reminiscent of major Marvel and Star Wars films, but without those franchises remotely involved.""
""Barbie"" tallied around $155 million during its first three days in theaters, the highest opening of 2023. Its counterpart ""Oppenheimer"" made $82.4 million over the weekend, according to numbers released Monday.
""Barbenheimer"" exploded over the weekend, generating more than $235.5 million in ticket sales and reinvigorating the domestic box office.
More than 18.5 million tickets were bought for the combination of Warner Bros. ' ""Barbie"" and Universal's ""Oppenheimer,"" 12.8 million for ""Barbie"" and 5.8 million for ""Oppenheimer,"" according to data from EntTelligence.
""It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""More importantly, it proves once again that America loves going to the movies to see great films.""
Both films hold a rating of more than 90% ""Fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes and inspired moviegoers to dress head-to-toe in pink or don suits and hats during their screenings.
""People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,"" O'Leary said. ""Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.""
With additional ticket sales from Paramount's newest ""Mission Impossible"" film, Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" and Angel Studios' ""The Sound of Freedom,"" the weekend box office is expected to reach $302 million, the highest of any weekend in 2023, according to data from Comscore.
""The unprecedented performance of these two films, and the boost it gave to the overall movie marketplace, solidified the movie theater as a cultural hub and epicenter of social interaction,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
""Barbenheimer"" weekend is currently set to be the fourth-highest weekend haul of all-time, just below the three-day stretch when Disney's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" arrived in theaters in December 2015 and helped boost the overall weekend haul to $313 million. The second-highest is $314 million from April 2018's opening weekend of ""Avengers: Infinity War.""
Some box office analysts project that Monday's official weekend numbers could be quite a bit higher than Sunday's estimates, and push ""Barbenheimer"" weekend up the charts. However, they won't come close to the highest-grossing weekend ever, which occurred in April 2019 when ""Avengers: Endgame"" hit theaters, drumming up $357 million on its own, and leading to a $402 million overall weekend tally.
The success of ""Barbenheimer"" comes at a time when the domestic box office has faced some hurdles. A slew of adult-aimed blockbusters have underperformed, leading many in the industry to question if consumer tastes have shifted away from Hollywood.
Warner Bros.' ""The Flash"" has fizzled, Pixar's ""Elemental"" failed to lure in family audiences and even the return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones wasn't enough to pack cinemas.
However, the combination of bombs and blonde bombshells seems to have inspired plenty of moviegoers to leave their couches for the cinema.
""It's a historic result that showcases the enthusiasm audiences have for a variety of fresh content,"" Robbins said. ""These films have exquisitely tapped into the cultural zeitgeist.

2023-08-06 15:58:15+00:00,'Barbie' makes history with $1 billion box office,"“Barbie” has answered the billion-dollar question with a resounding “yes.” Barely three weeks into its run, writer-director Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster has raked in an astounding $1.03 billion at the global box office, Warner Bros. reports. This makes Gerwig the first female director with a billion-dollar movie.","New York CNN —
“Barbie” has answered the billion-dollar question with a resounding “yes.” Barely three weeks into its run, writer-director Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster has raked in an astounding $1.03 billion at the global box office, according to official Warner Bros. estimates. This makes Gerwig the first solo female director with a billion-dollar movie.
As one half of the viral “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, it isn’t shocking “Barbie” has performed well. And, standing on her own two feet, the doll’s incredible success is not unexpected at all.
“I’ve been in this game for 30 years and the Barbie and Barbenheimer phenomenon is as unprecedented as it was unpredictable,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
According to Dergarabedian, only about 50 films in history, unadjusted for inflation, have hit the billion-dollar mark.
He added the movie’s marketing campaign was the first hint “Barbie” would be a box office smash. “The marketing campaign for ‘Barbie’ set into motion a chain of events that led to the word ‘Barbenheimer’ being added to the popular lexicon by virtue of its shared release date with ‘Oppenheimer,’ and that’s when we all knew something very special and unique was going to create a much bigger than expected outcome for the film not only for the opening weekend, but for its global run in theaters.”

In an interview with Collider last month, Margot Robbie — who produced the movie in addition to playing the titular character — shared a premonition she had at a greenlight meeting with studios.
“I think I told them they’d make a billion dollars which, maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make!” she said.
“Barbie” was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.
Its global success was driven by box office sales in some of the world’s largest movie markets, including the United Kingdom, Mexico and Australia. The movie has been the No. 1 release in these markets every weekend since its release, according to tracking site Box Office Mojo.
“Barbie” also performed well in China, the second-largest market in the world and one that has becoming increasingly insular over the past few years. According to experts, franchise films like “Transformers,” “Fast and Furious,” and Marvel’s superhero movies tend to perform well with Chinese audiences. While “Barbie” is similar to “Transformers” in that it’s based on an existing toy, it’s “not an IP that generations of Chinese have grown up with, so you lack the intergenerational appeal that a film like ‘Barbie’ has in the United States,” said Michael Berry, director of UCLA’s Center for Chinese Studies.
But Berry, who researches Chinese cinema and pop culture, says Barbie is still iconic around the world, giving the movie a solid springboard for international acclaim.
“Children in hundreds of countries… have grown up with the dolls, her imagery… (but) the film exploits that name-recognition in a very savvy way by playing into both the Barbie lovers and Barbie haters,” he said. “The film is also able to deftly walk a tightrope that appeals to both naïve and wide-eyed eight-year-old dreamers, who approach the film on one level, and adult audiences, who are able to interpret the film on an entirely different level, full of irony, humor, sexual innuendos, and allegory.”
“Barbie” has become everything from a relationship litmus test to a celebration of womanhood for people who may have come for the hot-pink outfits and stayed for the film’s existential questions.
“Driving that discourse is the film’s embrace of what generations of women have both loved and hated about the brand and what it’s often represented in the past,” said BoxOffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, adding that the movie “has tapped into cultural conversations about gender roles and female empowerment that aren’t bound by international borders.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJiaWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1oaXN0b3J5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzA4LzA2L2J1c2luZXNzL2JhcmJpZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWhpc3RvcnkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Make that 28 men and one woman: Greta Gerwig.
“Barbie,” directed by Ms. Gerwig from a script she wrote with her partner, Noah Baumbach, will finish the weekend with more than $1 billion in ticket sales at the global box office, according to Warner Bros. No movie in the studio’s 100-year history has sold so many tickets so fast, said Jeff Goldstein, Warner’s president of domestic distribution. As of Sunday, “Barbie” had been playing in theaters for 17 days. (“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” was previously the fastest to $1 billion, at 19 days.)
Ms. Gerwig could not be reached, according to a spokeswoman. Warner Bros. was giddy. “PINK FEVER,” Mr. Goldstein wrote in a text message. “Barbie” was No. 1 in the United States and Canada for the third weekend in a row, collecting $53 million, for a new domestic total of $459.4 million.

2023-07-19 19:40:01+00:00,Weekend Box Office Forecast: BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER Tracking to Combine for Potential $200M+ Opening as ‘Barbenheimer’ Phenom Takes Off,"""Barbenheimer"" has captured the pop culture zeitgeist as Barbie and Oppenheimer are set to deliver one of the biggest moviegoing weekends since 2019.","© Universal Pictures. All Rights Reserved.; © 2022 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved.
“Barbenheimer” has captured the pop culture zeitgeist, as Barbie and Oppenheimer are set to deliver one of the biggest moviegoing weekends since 2019.
To date, the biggest overall weekend at the box office since 2020 is Spider-Man: No Way Home‘s debut frame in December 2021, which saw the domestic market earn a total of $283 million. Prior to that, theaters posted $263.9 million during The Lion King‘s opening in late July 2019.
Individually, both Barbie and Oppenheimer could be aiming for significant milestones. For Barbie, Greta Gerwig could secure the record of largest opening weekend for a female-directed film. The top three films in that category now are Captain Marvel ($153.4 million, co-directed by Anna Boden and Nia DaCosta alongside Ryan Fleck), Frozen II ($130.3 million, co-directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck), and Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman ($103.3 million).
Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan’s career-best domestic openings outside the Dark Knight franchise are Inception ($62.8 million) and Dunkirk ($50.5 million). Current opening weekend projections for Oppenheimer put the film right in that range.
As the two films, especially Barbie, continue to track above long range expectations in their counter-programming showdown, here’s a rundown of what’s in play for the highly anticipated weekend.
Barbie
Warner Bros. Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $140M-$175M
PROS:
Throughout its marketing campaign, Barbie has spurred immense awareness and interest from women of all ages, an audience that has been largely underserved this summer—with the exception of Disney’s The Little mermaid, a domestic box office hit that’s nearing $300 million in total thanks to healthy holding power amid little competition.
Pre-sales have blown away all expectations in recent weeks as the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon has taken hold of social media. Independent sales data reflects the meme’s popularity, with Barbie trending more than 200 percent ahead of The Little Mermaid‘s Thursday previews in true admissions, when Wednesday’s “Barbie Blowout Party” screenings at approximately 500 locations are taken into account. Other bullish models have Barbie trending 29 percent ahead of recent Marvel films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Boxoffice Pro‘s parent company, The Boxoffice Company, reports the film has outpaced all 2023 releases at the same point in the release cycle, making it their top pre-seller since Avatar: The Way of Water.
Reviews are very positive for director and co-writer Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of the Mattel toy line with a 90 percent Rotten Tomatoes score from 138 critics. If audience reception is comparable, Barbie could avoid a sharply frontloaded run.
CONS:
Although the film is gaining scattered showtimes where possible (particularly in Dolby Cinema), Barbie will be missing a large portion of the typical premium screen footprint that accompanies most major studio tentpole releases due to Oppenheimer exclusively holding IMAX as well as many showtimes in other formats. That creates significant volatility in the floor and ceiling of forecasts. (Notably, Warner Bros. is cautiously expecting $75 million for Barbie‘s opening.)
Reviews are pointing to Barbie‘s appeal as a satirical comedy, which is likely to narrow its target audience to young adults and older moviegoers rather than the kid- and parent-friendly demographics that drove The Super Mario Bros. Movie earlier this year.
Oppenheimer
Universal Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $52M-$72M
PROS:
Christopher Nolan’s reputation as a pioneer of modern spectacle cinema driven by strong narratives with wide audience appeal is a major driving force behind his latest original film. Another factor driving admissions is Nolan’s loyal fan base, which has expanded since the release of The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception.
Perhaps as a partial consequence of the “Barbenheimer” phenom, Oppenheimer pre-sales across sample regions have exceeded even optimistic expectations, with independent tracking sources putting the film at least 73 percent ahead of the pace of Dune and slightly ahead of John Wick: Chapter 4 when adjusting for Oppenheimer‘s large premium screen demand.
Adjacent to pre-sales trends, double feature screenings are being planned by more than 200,000 moviegoers, according to a report from the National Association of Theatre Owners. This may be working to increase Oppenheimer‘s already high profile among segments of the younger Barbie audience that may not have otherwise turned out for the Universal release on opening weekend.
Oppenheimer‘s initial wave of reviews are incredibly positive, standing at 95 percent fresh from 98 critics. The film is widely considered to be an early award season candidate with strong adult appeal that could drive box office through the rest of summer.
CONS:
With preview show demand adjustment in mind, audiences seem to be favoring PLF for their viewing of Oppenheimer. That could create a more backloaded run in the grand scheme of things—which would be a positive development, even though it increases volatility and lowers the ceiling for opening weekend projections in the event that walk-up sales outside major cities don’t end up as robust as is typical for other films.
As a three-hour, R-rated film, the film may be stepping outside some of Nolan’s audience wheelhouse and skewing appeal more toward metro regions.
Current projection ranges call for a 97% to 127% increase from last weekend’s $134.2 million top ten aggregate.

2023-08-13 20:17:46+00:00,'Barbie' box office: Movie on track to become highest grossing domestic film of the year,“Barbie” has broken numerous records since its July 21 opening and the summer blockbuster is close to breaking another one.,"New York CNN —
“Barbie” has broken numerous records since its July 21 opening and the summer blockbuster is close to breaking another one.
Trailing behind “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” by an estimated $48 million, writer-director Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” appears destined to gain the top spot for highest grossing domestic film of 2023.
“Barbie” raked in a stunning $155 million domestically in its opening weekend and last week joined the $1 billion club in global box office sales – a feat only achieved by about 50 films in history, adjusted for inflation, Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN. While “Pink Fever” has slowed in the last week, “Barbie” is estimated to have earned $33.7 million this weekend to maintain its stronghold in the theaters.
The comedy about the iconic doll is estimated to have reached $525 million domestic and nearly $1.2 billion worldwide. “Barbie” took in $10 million Friday alone, earning an average above $11.3 million per day from August 5-11. “Barbie” passed the $500 million domestic mark in the middle of its third week, while “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” needed more than five weeks to reach the milestone.
The combined release of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” dubbed “Barbenheimer,” has become a pop culture sensation and one that might revive the struggling movie theater industry. Together, Barbenheimer was the fourth highest-grossing industry weekend of all time in North America, totaling $302 million. Most top-grossing films often involve elaborate action scenes and special effects, unlike “Barbenheimer.”
“I’ve been in this game for 30 years and the ‘Barbie’ and ‘Barbenheimer’ phenomenon is as unprecedented as it was unpredictable,” said Dergarabedian.
He added the movie’s marketing campaign was the first hint “Barbie” would be a box office smash.
“The marketing campaign for ‘Barbie’ set into motion a chain of events that led to the word ‘Barbenheimer’ being added to the popular lexicon by virtue of its shared release date with ‘Oppenheimer,’ and that’s when we all knew something very special and unique was going to create a much bigger than expected outcome for the film not only for the opening weekend, but for its global run in theaters,” said Dergarabedian.

2023-07-29 15:16:46+00:00,Box Office: ‘Haunted Mansion’ $9.9 Million Opening Day Can’t Scare ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’,"Disney's new ""Haunted Mansion"" earned $9.9 million on its opening day, as ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" look to stay strong at the top of the box office.","“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” ain’t afraid of no ghost.
Disney’s new “Haunted Mansion” is settling for third place behind the formidable pair of blockbusters. The reimagining earned $9.9 million from 3,740 locations on its opening day, a figure that includes $3.1 million in Thursday previews. The family-friendly funhouse feature was projecting an opening between $25 million and $30 million, a range that some rivals predict the debut will end up falling short of.
With a $150 million production budget, “Haunted Mansion” is looking to be another disappointing chapter for Disney’s summer slate. Things kicked off strong with Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” which released in May and tallied up $358 million in North America. But after “The Little Mermaid” failed to make a substantial splash overseas, the studio followed with two costly underperformers in “Elemental” and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”
No doubt that a swath of family audiences have kept their attention on “Barbie.” “Haunted Mansion” simply doesn’t have the critical buzz to keep up, turning in a low 27% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are more friendly with a “B+” grade through research firm Cinema Score, but the Disney remake could certainly use some stronger sentiment than that.
Directed by Justin Simien, who showed teeth with “Dear White People” and the horror satire “Bad Hair,” “Haunted Mansion” draws inspiration from the Disneyland theme park ride of the same name. The attraction spawned a feature starring Eddie Murphy in 2003, which flipped a $90 million production budget for a $180 million global gross. This new entry recruits a substantial cast that includes LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Dan Levy, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto.
Also opening this weekend, A24 is putting its latest horror play “Talk to Me” in 2,340 locations. The Australian ghost story was acquired by the indie banner after a buzzy screening at the Sundance Film Festival. With some positive reviews on its side, the film is projected to open in sixth place with a solid $10.1 million gross.
“Barbie” will remain on top in its second weekend, earning a commanding $29 million on Friday. That’s down 59% from its massive $70.5 opening day, which ranks as the largest of the year. The Warner Bros. release actually added 94 more locations for its sophomore outing, now playing in 4,337 venues.
It’s impressive for a film like “Barbie,” which opened north of $150 million, to be projecting a drop of less than 50%. Most blockbusters with that immediate impact face a sharper tumble in their sophomore outings. It all speaks to the superlative one-two punch behind the Greta Gerwig-directed feature: ubiquitous build-up marketing and the perception of quality that delivered.
The hot-pink fantasia will push its domestic total beyond $350 million this weekend, already making it the fourth-highest grossing North American release of the year in just 10 days. It’ll likely pass “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” ($377 million) and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” ($358 million) within the next week, only leaving “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($574 million) ahead of it on 2023 charts.
Universal’s “Oppenheimer” is maintaining second place, projecting a $46 million haul from 3,647 theaters. That’d notch an impressive 44% drop from its opening and would be enough to rank as the fifth-biggest sophomore outing ever for an R-rated release.
The Christopher Nolan feature would probably have landed an even stronger hold if it wasn’t playing strongly throughout the week. On Thursday, “Oppenheimer” became the first R-rated release to sell more than $10 million in tickets for seven days in a row. A big factor to that is the film’s play in Imax. Audiences believe that a Nolan feature demands a huge screen; that’s left consumers motivated to set aside time during the week to land a ticket for one of those premium large formats.
“Oppenheimer” should push its domestic haul to $173 million through Sunday, enough to slot it as the eighth-highest grossing North American release of the year after 10 days of release. It’s already the biggest non-IP production of the year too.
“Sound of Freedom” looks to take fourth, with rivals projecting another slim drop (-31%) this weekend, for a $13 million gross through the three-day frame. The film was acquired by Angel Studios from 20th Century Studios after the acquisition of Fox by Disney; it’s proven a wise investment. Rolling Stone has deemed “Sound of Freedom” a “QAnon-tinged thriller” that targets “the conscience of a conspiracy-addled boomer” — but controversy has likely only gotten more eyeballs on the film as religious and conservative media groups rally behind it.
With a total domestic gross likely reaching $150 million this weekend, a finish above $200 million and among the top 10 highest-earners of the year does seem to be in the cards. Angel Studios has instituted an unconventional “Pay It Forward” system, allowing people to donate money to the distribution banner so that the studio can purchase tickets for its own movie and distribute them for free. The company touts the initiative as a tool to raise awareness on child trafficking. Regardless of what fraction of those admissions end up redeemed, that’s all still money in the pocket for exhibitors.
Rounding out the top five, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is relishing a softer fall in its third weekend, down 44% from its sophomore outing. The Tom Cruise action sequel faced a sharper tumble than expected last week at 64.6% — not an auspicious development for a franchise that has usually enjoyed long runs at the box office.
The Paramount release will hit $139 million through Sunday, still tracking behind what its predecessor “Fallout” earned through the same stretch of time ($161 million). With a production budget skirting $300 million, “Dead Reckoning” has been dealt a tough hand at the box office, facing stiff competition for viewers by contending against “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and even “Sound of Freedom.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaGF1bnRlZC1tYW5zaW9uLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWJhcmJpZS1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NjgyODkxL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvaGF1bnRlZC1tYW5zaW9uLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWJhcmJpZS1zZWNvbmQtd2Vla2VuZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1NjgyODkxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Xolo Mariduena stars ase Jaime Reyes in Warner Bros.' ""Blue Beetle."" Warner Bros. Discovery
It's pink vs. blue at the box office this weekend. As ""Barbie"" continues a historic run in theaters, a little-known superhero called ""Blue Beetle"" is looking to take the top spot on the charts this weekend. With $3.3 million from Thursday night previews, Warner Bros. Discovery's latest film based on a DC Comics character is expected to take in between $22 million and $32 million during its domestic debut. Meanwhile, Warner Bros.' ""Barbie,"" which has steadily tallied $545 million domestically since its late July release, is expected to add between $17 million and $22 million during its fifth weekend. ""Blue Beetle"" arrives in theaters after several DC Comics-based films have flopped at the box office and while the studio undergoes a major creative regime change. ""The four movies released this year are orphans,"" said Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University and a pop culture expert, referring to DC titles ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods,"" ""The Flash,"" ""Blue Beetle"" and the upcoming ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom."" ""They're part of the old universe that's about to get completely rebooted. [Warner Bros.] has to promote these, they want them to be big hits, obviously, but there is a sense that they're part of the old guard,"" Thompson said. And audiences haven't turned out for these films so far. ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods"" generated just $57.6 million domestically and ""The Flash"" tallied a little more than $100 million in the U.S. and Canada. These performances show an ""indifference"" from audiences, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
Will 'Blue Beetle' take flight or be squashed?
When ""Blue Beetle"" first entered development in 2018, there was potential for the character of Jaime Reyes, the man behind the moniker, to cross paths with DC's other famed heroes. However, turnover at the studio, mostly due to the merger between Warner Media and Discovery, has put the future of the hero in question. As superhero movies have become more popular in the cultural zeitgeist, much of the appeal of big franchises has been the interconnectability of the stories. It's why Disney's Marvel Studios was able to to introduce obscure comic book characters like the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man and Moon Knight into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and turn them into fan favorites. Blue Beetle, without the promise of interaction with Justice League veterans like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash or Aquaman, might not be able to drum up much enthusiasm at the box office. To be sure, standalone, unconnected films have had success for DC in the recent past, but they featured well-known characters like Batman and the Joker. ""We're in limbo now,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""In a world where superheroes aren't really novelties anymore, that's going to be a tough sell for a lot of people."" Robbins said ""Blue Beetle,"" which features a Mexican-American family at its core, could benefit from an influx of Hispanic moviegoers in the same way that Marvel's ""Black Panther"" saw Black moviegoers who were not comic book fans rush out to see the film. Critics have raved about Xolo Mariduena's magnetic performance as the titular character and how the film centers on a hero who is family-focused, not a lone gunslinger. ""Blue Beetle"" still falls into some of the old trappings of past superhero movies, including chaotic, repetitive CGI fight sequences, but some say as DC course corrects in the next few years, it should look to keep Mariduena and Blue Beetle on its roster. ""A film like 'Blue Beetle' could benefit from solid word-of-mouth,"" said Dergarabedian. ""Judgement for the latest DC entry should come after the first three weeks, not the first three days in theaters.""

“Barbie” wore several hats this weekend, with domestic “Barbie” impressing with $93 million in gross revenue and international “Barbie” bringing in around $122 million, making it the No. 1 release worldwide.
It is the largest domestic second weekend performance ever for Warner Bros., which distributed the movie. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)
“Oppenheimer” also had a blowout weekend, with a domestic total of $46 million, according to estimates from media analytics company Comscore, bringing its worldwide total to almost half a billion dollars. Universal, which distributed the movie, estimated Oppenheimer will be Nolan’s biggest non-superhero film of all-time in 40 regions, and his biggest film ever in 28.
Crucially, these numbers reflect that not only is there high energy and excitement for movies, but an appetite for the movie theater experience.

“Barbenheimer was never going to happen on your TV, it’s just not,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners in the United States. “You have to go into the theater to experience it.”
Repeat viewings are also fueling box office earnings. Midwest-based chain B&B Theaters estimated that across its 55 theaters, more than 2,100 people saw “Barbie” both opening weekend and this weekend, and almost 500 returned to see “Oppenheimer.”
“Hollywood” is often considered interchangeable with “the movie industry,” and O’Leary notes that there has always been a strong movie theater culture in the United States.
After the pandemic ravaged theaters and public screenings, people are now looking forward to “sitting in a theater with world-class projection and sound systems, having an immersive experience alongside other people,” he said.
“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” will trigger more and more people going to the movies by reminding them “the best of what the theatrical experience can be. It’s a reawakening,” he added.

O’Leary expects the movies to perform well for weeks to come, noting there’s been a rise over the past several years in very strong holdover weekends. That could be partly due to energetic word-of-mouth stoked by social media.
“At their core, consumers want to go see a compelling story, they want to be entertained,” he said. “If stories resonate with people… they tell other people.”
The overwhelming appreciation for these creative projects means that the ongoing Writers Guild of America and actors union SAG-AFTRA strikes could be a dark cloud over the these financial successes, according to some analysts.
“There’s pressure to resolve (these labor disputes) because the possibility of revenue is built on the foundation of having movies and actors to promote them,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “For now we have high-profile films, but that pool will be drying out.”

The production limbo caused by a lack of negotiations on the part of studios are leading to a ripple effect where the release dates for those projects will also be postponed. According to Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, this means that in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024, theater chains will need “to keep a weather eye on the horizon for problems beyond their control.”
“While it’s important to celebrate the good times right now and realize they can be a barometer for the future, it’s just as important to recognize the fight for equality by so many who play a part in creating the content we see on our screens, large and small,” he added.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8zMC9idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItYm94LW9mZmljZS1tb3ZpZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDcvMzAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtbW92aWVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Barbie
Warner Bros.’ comedy declines only -36% to $21.5M, finally notching the runner-up slot after spending four frames in first place.
All time, Barbie has now earned the:
With $567.2M total through 31 days, it now ranks as the #15 biggest movie of all time, between April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie with $574.2M and 2019’s The Lion King with $543.6M.
Barbie also ranks #2 of the year so far, behind only Mario. However, it’s running +12% ahead of Mario through the equivalent 31-day point in release: $503.7M.
Oppenheimer
Universal’s historical war drama declines only -43% to $10.6M, falling from second to third place.
All time, Oppenheimer has earned:
Opening weekend outside the top 100: $82.4M
Fifth frame once again falling outside the top 100: $10.6M
With $285.2M total through 31 days, it now stands as the #117 biggest movie of all time domestically, ranking between 1990’s Home Alone with $285.7M and 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 with $281.7M.
It also stands as the #7 biggest R-rated movie of all time domestically, between 2018’s Deadpool 2 with $324.5M and 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded with $281.5M.
Depending on how it holds, Oppenheimer stands a shot at finishing among the top five R-rated film, with a small shot at #1. Currently, that mark has been held for 19 years by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ: $370.7M.
Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to the top five R-rated films ever, through the equivalent 31-day point in wide release:
-6% behind 2004’s The Passion of the Christ : $305.6M -13% behind 2016’s Deadpool : $328.2M -13% behind 2014’s American Sniper : also $328.2M -3% behind 2019’s Joker : $299.1M -6% behind 2017’s It : $305.2M
Oppenheimer is also poised to become writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biggest (non-Batman) film. Here’s how Oppenheimer compares to his other biggest original titles:
+14% above 2010’s Inception , through the equivalent point in release: $248.4M / only -2% behind its final total: $292.5M
+51% and counting above the final total for 2014’s Interstellar : $188.0M
+50% and counting above the final total for 2017’s Dunkirk : $190.0M
Last Wednesday, Oppenheimer also set another unusual record: highest-grossing film to never top a weekend box office.
It beat the prior record holder, 2016’s Sing with $270.3M, which peaked at #2 behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
Overseas / global
This weekend, Oppenheimer declined -38% overseas, milder than its -44% domestic drop.
Oppenheimer has earned $432.6M overseas and $717.8M globally.
That beats Dunkirk globally with $530M and Interstellar with $648M, and is right on the verge of surpassing Inception with $728M, likely later this week.
Globally, it’s now the #132 film of all time, ranking between 2021’s F9 with $726.2M and Nolan’s Interstellar with $715.7M.
Top overseas markets totals are:
U.K.: $63.8M Germany: $39.5M France: $31.2M Australia: $22.9M India: $18.4M Spain: $18.3M Mexico: $18.0M Netherlands: $16.1M South Korea: $12.6M Brazil: $12.5M
Later this month, the film will debut in key markets including China and Italy.
IMAX
Oppenheimer has earned $80.8M domestically and $146.4M globally from IMAX, the #4 domestic and #5 global IMAX total of all time.
Globally, it only trails 2009’s Avatar, 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water, 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem
In its third frame, Paramount’s animated action comedy reboot declines -45% to $8.4M, falling from third to fourth place.
After a midweek Wednesday debut, Mayhem has earned $88.1M after 19 days. It’s already outgrossed two of the last three films in the franchise:
+7% and counting above the final total for 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows – $82.0M
+62% and counting above the final total for 2007’s TMNT : $54.1M
However, it’s running below both the franchise’s 2014 installment and another comparable title, through the equivalent 19-day point in release:
-40% below 2014’s hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : $148.4M
-23% below 2018’s similar animation style Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse – $114.3M
Overseas / global
This weekend, Mayhem declined -52% overseas in holdover markets, slightly steeper than its -45% domestic drop.
Mayhem has now earned $30.3M overseas and $118.4M globally.
It looks certain not to reach the $485M global total for 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but could still match the $245M global total for 2016’s Out of the Shadows.
Top overseas markets are:
U.K.: $9.0M Mexico: $5.0M France: $3.2M Germany: $2.0M
Last weekend, the film opened with less than $1M in China, only eighth place in that market.
Later this month and next, the film will debut in key markets including Spain, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, and Japan.

Strays
Universal’s R-rated comedy about talking dogs didn’t have much bite, with only a $8.3M fifth place debut.

It also opened below some of this year’s other R-rated comedies:
-44% below June’s No Hard Feelings : $15.0M
Even with February’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance : $8.3M
However, it did open +43% above July’s Joy Ride: $5.8M
Audience demographics
Strays earned a “B+” CinemaScore, from an audience estimated at 56% male, 67% ages 25+, and only 46% white.
Overseas / global
Strays opened in a limited 21 overseas markets to $1.9M, for a $10.2M global opening.
While it’s not an exact comparison because of the wider rollout, Feelings opened to $9.5M overseas in 48 markets, for a $24.5M global opening.

2023-07-23 23:03:08+00:00,Inside ‘Barbie’s’ Pink Publicity Machine: How Warner Bros. Pulled Off the Marketing Campaign of the Year,"Here's everything that went into ""Barbie's"" ubiquitous marketing campaign.","Unless you’ve been trapped in a plastic toy box, there’s no escaping the Barbie-core movement that’s sweeping the globe — and potentially contributing a nationwide shortage of the color pink.
The marketing department at Warner Bros. has been working in overdrive to entice the masses for Greta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored fantasy “Barbie,” which has been everywhere this summer. A key factor has been a dizzying array of partnerships with products that range from a bright fuchsia Xbox (for STEM Barbie) to this $1,350 Balmain cropped hoodie (for Disposable Income Barbie).
And that’s only scratching the surface of the brands that helped propel the movie to cultural touchstone status before arriving in theaters on July 21. In Malibu, there’s a real-life Barbie Dreamhouse that’s bookable through Airbnb. There’s also a themed boat cruise that’s setting sail in the Boston area.
The efforts of the extensive and expensive marketing campaign — which rival studio executives estimate to cost $150 million, not including the $145 million production budget — are already paying off.
“Barbie,” starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as life-size versions of the popular Mattel dolls, crushed box office expectations with $165 million in North America and a stunning $337 million globally. With the help of “Oppenheimer,” which debuted to $80.5 million, this weekend boasted the biggest collective box office turnout of the pandemic era, as well as the fourth-biggest in history. It’s an especially big deal at a time when Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford have struggled to save the box office.
In wake of its record-breaking debut, Warner Bros. president of global marketing Josh Goldstine spoke to Variety about the buzzy memes, must-have costumes and “Barbenheimer” phenomenon that led to this summer’s very pink smash hit.
When did you start to notice the “Barbie” marketing was resonating in a big way?
We had a lot of internal discussions about “What’s the right first piece of material?” and “When is the timing of it? How much of the story should we give away?” Each time we released something, the movie was getting to a new level of engagement in the culture.
The first electric moment was at CinemaCon in 2022. We put out a single image of Barbie in her Corvette in Barbieland. It was one of those moments that took on a life of its own. About a month later, they were shooting in Santa Monica and we knew people were going to be able to take pictures on the street of Margot and Ryan in their multi-color Dayglow outfits on the beach. We started to see the material electrify the culture.
Pink was a big part of the campaign. How did you decide to lean into that color palette?
Barbie Pink has been such a part of the brand. This movie has a wonderful girl-power element, and pink became the color of the movie. We saw it start to resonate in the culture very early in the long process. The concept of Barbie-core coming to life in fashion kept going. It didn’t have its moment; it sustained and kept growing and growing with the movie.
How much of the marketing was manufactured and how much took off organically?
We saw it as a breadcrumb strategy, where we gave people little elements of the movie to stimulate curiosity and that created conversation. In every campaign, there are elements of earned media [like social media buzz] and paid media [such as a trailer spot]. We believed this brand had the opportunity to generate some exciting earned media. Some of the choices we made stimulated that. Then it did totally take on a life of its own.
A movie of this scope and scale usually costs $100 million to $150 million to market. Did you go over budget?
I won’t comment on the budget. The reason people think we spent so much is that it’s so ubiquitous. That’s a combination of paid media and how many partners came to play with us. Because it pierced the zeitgeist, it has the impression that we spend so much. In fact, we spent responsibly for an event movie.
Can you talk about how some of the less-obvious partnerships, like Crocs or Flo from Progressive Insurance, came together?
Some of those were licensing deals with Mattel and some are brands that made their own decisions to be part of the color schema of the movie. Fashion, frankly, jumped onto the bandwagon. Brands wanted to become part of this because they saw the film was finding its way into culture in such a dynamic way. It stopped becoming a marketing campaign and took on the quality of a movement.
How rare is it that so many brands wanted to partner with the studio on a non-franchise movie?
I’ve been doing this for 35 years. This is one of the most unique experiences I’ve ever had.
Who came up with the Malibu Barbie Dreamhouse for rent on Airbnb?
That was a promotion our team did working with Airbnb. We had a partnership with a giant mansion in Malibu that was given a massive makeover and turned into a modern-day Malibu Dreamhouse. They had great aerial photography of it. It was a “Dreamhouse” in the Barbie sense of the word, but it was also just an incredible Malibu mansion that got this crazy makeover.

What was your favorite less-flashy aspect of the campaign?
We did a very provocative teaser trailer and put it [before showings of] “Avatar: The Way of Water” which is maybe not your first thought for a “Barbie” movie. It had music from “2001: A Space Odyssey” in an homage to the Stanley Kubrick film. It made a bold statement that this movie isn’t going to be exactly what you think it is.
Were you concerned that parodying “2001,” which is a film that was released in 1968, would go over the heads of people who actually play with Barbies?
Yes, that was absolutely a concern. We wanted to challenge people. We wanted to make something thought-provoking. People had preconceptions. We thought that, by shaking them, we could create a tremendous amount of curiosity.
How did you come up with the various taglines, like “If you love Barbie, if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you”?
That was a collaboration with our director. It was a thought that she had and we refined it with her. We wanted to recognize there were legions of Barbie fans, but that Barbie had quite a history and there are people who felt like Barbie wasn’t for them. This was a movie that understood that and was acknowledging it. Listen, the word “hate” is a tricky word for marketing and we don’t usually use it. But in this case, it allowed the tent of people to experience this movie and to realize that it understood the journey that Barbie has been on for the last 45 to 50 years.
How important is TikTok as a marketing resource?
We did promotional work with them, but a tremendous amount is organic. In a really exciting way, this whole “Barbenheimer” phenomenon created a series of conversations and engagements. It’s paid off in the sense that both movies are hitting the high side this weekend.
Have you seen the memes and jokes about the relentlessness of the “Barbie” marketing team?
Someone took a picture of a pink sunset and thanked the work of the Warner Bros. marketing department. I thought that was pretty amusing.
What has it been like to see people decked out in pink and dressed up in costumes to watch the movie in theaters?
Wearing pink became a way of acknowledging their connection to the movie. My wife just came back from taking my 86-year-old mother-in-law to the movie. She was sending me pictures of a sea of pink in the theater. It’s a way of being part of this really wonderful collective experience.

2023-08-14 18:59:39+00:00,‘Barbie’s’ Big Payday: Margot Robbie Will Earn $50 Million in Salary and Box Office Bonuses (EXCLUSIVE),Margot Robbie will earn $50 million in salary and box office bonuses for her role in 'Barbie.',"Margot Robbie is being richly rewarded for her key role in bringing “Barbie” to the big screen. The star and producer behind the summer’s biggest hit stands to make roughly $50 million in salary and box office bonuses, according to three individuals with knowledge of her deal.
“Barbie” director and co-writer Greta Gerwig will also likely receive bonuses because of the film’s outsized success. “Barbie” has earned an astonishing $526.3 million at the domestic box office since it opened a month ago, as well as $657.6 million at the international box office. That comes out to $1.18 billion globally — and that figure should keep climbing given that “Barbie” is still topping box office charts. The film is now the second highest-grossing release in the history of Warner Bros., behind “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.” It’s also the highest-grossing film ever from a female director, overtaking the previous record holder, “Frozen II,” which was co-directed by Jennifer Lee.
In addition to bringing the popular children’s toy to glittering life, Robbie produced the film through her production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, which she founded in 2014 with her now-husband, Tom Ackerley, and friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. The goal of the company was to tell women’s stories on screen and support women creators behind the scenes. Its slate of projects includes the Oscar-winning “Promising Young Woman,” the superhero sequel “Birds of Prey” and the Netflix series “Maid.”
Robbie has been nominated for two Academy Awards for her performances in “I, Tonya” and “Bombshell.” She first came to prominence in Martin Scorsese’s “Wolf of Wall Street” and scored commercial hits with “Suicide Squad” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” But none of those films has come close to achieving the lofty box office heights of “Barbie,” which is shaping up to be one of the bigger blockbusters in movie history.
Warner Bros. declined to comment and a representative for Robbie had no comment.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLXBheS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXNhbGFyeS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJvbnVzZXMtMTIzNTY5NTU2My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-12 16:49:42+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Last Voyage of the Demeter’ Sinking After $2.6 Million Opening Day, ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Sail On","The Dracula horror movie ""Last Voyage of the Demeter"" is projecting a meagre $6.5 million opening as ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" stay on top.","“The Last Voyage of the Demeter,” a new period horror film set aboard a merchant ship, is capsizing in its debut at the domestic box office amid the ongoing success of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”
The Universal release — the studio’s second stab this year at a Dracula film after the action-comedy “Renfield” bombed in the spring — is facing some choppy waters after earning $2.62 million on its opening day from 2,715 locations, a figure that includes $750,000 in Thursday previews. “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” is projecting a fifth-place debut and a mere $6.5 million gross for its three-day opening weekend.
Nothing really says the summer blockbuster season is winding down like an anachronistic genre picture meeting a swift end in its debut. Even with a production budget totaling only $45 million — a moderate figure for a period spectacle — it’ll likely be difficult for “The Last Voyage” to be a theatrical success. Reviews have been meager, turning in a 27% approval rating from top critics on aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences don’t really dig the film either, with Cinema Score’s survey of early ticket buyers leading to a mediocre “B-” grade.
Based on a chapter of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” tells the story of a merchant ship and its crew, who find themselves at the mercy of a vampire who has snowed away. Directed by André Øvredal (“Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”), the film stars Corey Hawkins, Aisling Franciosi, Liam Cunningham and David Dastmalchian.
It’s still a “Barbie” world at the box office, as rivals project the fantasy comedy added $31.4 million from 4,178 locations in its fourth weekend of release, down just 41% from its prior frame. Warner Bros. has yet to send numbers for Friday.
Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” surpassed $1 billion last week at the global box office, making Gerwig the first-ever solo female filmmaker with a billion-dollar movie. Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the hot-pink comedy crossed the $500 million mark domestically on Friday and is expected to become the top-grossing Warner Bros. release of all time in North America, unadjusted for inflation. “The Dark Knight” currently holds the record at $534 million.
Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” added $5.1 million from 3,761 theaters on Friday, a decline of 39% from last weekend. The Universal biographical drama is projecting $17.2 million for the weekend, which would be down 41% from its previous outing, bringing domestic ticket sales of $262 million.
In third place, Paramount Pictures’ “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” earned $4 million from 3,950 locations on its second Friday, a decline of 56% from its debut. The animated feature, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Point Grey Productions, is tracking for a $14.6 million three-day weekend, leading to a domestic total north of $71.6 million.
“Meg 2: The Trench” isn’t making huge waves at the domestic box office, as rivals project only $11.8 million from 3,604 theaters for its second outing. That’d be down a hefty 60% from its $30 million opening weekend, which was already a significant drop from the 2018 original’s $45 million domestic debut.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvbGFzdC12b3lhZ2UtZGVtZXRlci1vcGVuaW5nLWRheS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTY5NDI1OC_SAWtodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2xhc3Qtdm95YWdlLWRlbWV0ZXItb3BlbmluZy1kYXktYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU2OTQyNTgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 13:09:33+00:00,"International Box Office’s July Mega Month Propelled by ‘Barbie,’ ‘Oppenheimer’ and Chinese Blockbusters",A huge July in China and key international territories accelerated the recovery of the global box office.,"Theatrical cinema in July enjoyed its highest revenues since pre-pandemic times, with global box office hitting $4.54 billion during the month.
“This is the single highest-grossing month since before the pandemic began. The result sees July 2023 track 17% ahead of the July average of the last three pre-pandemic years (2017-2019),” said research and advisory firm Gower Street Analytics.
“July 2023 also marked the first month since the pandemic began in 2020 that all three key component markets that make up the global picture — North America, China and international (excluding China) — tracked ahead of their pre-pandemic averages.”
The July box office in North America stacked up to $1.36 billion, 11% better than the 2017-2019 three-year average; $1.98 billion in international (excluding China), 7% ahead of the same three-year average; and $1.2 billion in China, some 53% better than its three-year average.
The July surge has most notably been propelled by the “Barbenheimer” duo of “Barbie” (with a $423 million international cumulative and $351 million in North America, of Sunday) and “Oppenheimer” ($226 million international cumulative and $174 million in North America), and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1” ($309 million in international territories and $139 million in North America), plus the June-released “Elemental” ($250 million international, $145 million in North America). But it has also been lifted by a string of July-released mainland Chinese blockbusters.
These include “Lost in the Stars” ($503 million after 28 days), “Never Say Never” ($310 million after 28 days), “Chang An” ($233 million after 26 days) and “Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms” ($197 million after 14 days).
The hot streak propelled giant screen specialist Imax to its best July of all time. “Last month was the highest-grossing month of July ever for Imax worldwide, in North America and in China,” the company said in a filing this week. “[In China] Maoyan’s ‘Creation of the Gods I’ has earned $20.1 million to date for the company. The film debuted July 20 to an $8.6 million opening weekend in Imax — an Imax-record 16.6% of the debut for a local release and Imax’s biggest ever summer opening weekend for a Chinese film.”
“Oppenheimer,” which was made with Imax-certified cameras, is being given an additional week through Aug. 17 in many territories, and there are plans in some to continue playing the film through late summer and fall.
“Oppenheimer” is set to debut in China on Aug. 30 on conventional and Imax screens, though a potential flashpoint exists if Universal and the film’s famously protective director Christopher Nolan do not agree to cuts expected to be required by China’s censors. In addition to the sex scene that has been blacked out in some territories, communism is a recurring negative theme throughout the movie.
Even without major help from “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” (which opened weakly, but has now rallied to a $30 million running total) the China box office rebound is remarkable. July further accelerated the recovery trend.
Consultancy firm Artisan Gateway says that July (worth $1.28 billion, or RMB8.7 billion, by its calculation) was the second biggest month this year in the Middle Kingdom. Only January, which benefitted from “Avatar 2” and a slew of Chinese New Year tentpoles, was bigger at $1.4 billion (or RMB10.1 billion).
The strong July lifts China’s gross year-to-date box office to $4.9 billion (RMB35 billion). That figure represents a 69% improvement when compared with a heavily disrupted 2022 and sees the running total only 6% behind the January-July total in pre-pandemic 2019.
It was achieved with Hollywood’s contribution largely muted. Artisan Gateway notes that four Chinese films each exceeded RMB1 billion, a notable landmark in China. “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1” was the best performing import of the month with $46.5 million (RMB 330 million). Overall, Chinese-language titles accounted for 81% of the China total box office in July, with all imports (mostly Hollywood and Japanese animation) sharing the remaining 19%.
Nor was China the only international market where July was a box office scorcher. Gower Street data shows several other major markets beat their three-year averages for that month. The U.K. and Ireland market was 18% ahead, France was 14% ahead, Germany was 35% ahead, Spain was 14%, Italy almost double at 98% ahead, Australia was 13% ahead and Brazil was 5% improved. Another big territory, Mexico, was on par with its pre-pandemic July average.
July has lifted the global year-to-date box office total to $20.95 billion. That is fully 31% better than 2022 and only 11% worse than the 2017-2019 average of $23.6 billion.
International markets lead the way. International (excluding China) is 12% behind the three-year average at $10.3 billion to the end of July. Within that, Latin America is the standout, at $1.76 billion, only a 3% deficit to the three-year average; Europe, the Middle East and Africa at $5.23 billion is 12% down and Asia-Pacific (excluding China) at $3.32 billion is 15% down.
The North American total to end of July, at $5.83 billion, is still 18% behind the average, Gower Street calculates.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWp1bHktYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWNoaW5lc2UtYmxvY2tidXN0ZXJzLTEyMzU2ODY3MjUv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtanVseS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItY2hpbmVzZS1ibG9ja2J1c3RlcnMtMTIzNTY4NjcyNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-03 22:45:55+00:00,Peter Bart: ‘Barbie’ Has Box Office Floating On Pink Cloud With Its Fascinating Distractions,"Barbie is confounding: In addition to setting box office records, the movie has also inspired a flood of commentaries about its presumed ""message.""","Barbie is confounding: In addition to setting box office records, the movie has also inspired a flood of commentaries about its presumed “message.”
Yes, there have been more editorials about a doll than about a bomb. Why did Barbie complain about “cognitive dissonance” at a Mattel corporate meeting? Or denounce “sexualized consumerism”? For that matter, was it rude to joke about Proust, the revered French novelist?
Were director Greta Gerwig and her co-screenwriter, husband Noah Baumbach, nurturing a hidden subtext in their script?
And should we care? The big news on Barbie: it’s headed for $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales by this weekend, vastly surpassing Oppenheimer, which has a longer running time and more limited release schedule (it’s at $181 million U.S.).
Even Barbie swag is as inescapably pervasive as it is numbingly pink. The caps, T-shirts, tote bags, sunglasses and toy cars have arrived like a wave of Pepto Bismol. Try entering a bar wearing a hint of Barbie regalia, and heads turn while the talk swings away from residuals.
Why did Mattel, the toy giant, co-produce a feminist movie that satirizes its own executives? Sure, it’s all about big business, but did that justify Ariana Greenblatt’s Sasha shouting “you fascist” to Barbie?
To be sure, an analysis of swag may not be appropriate at a time when pickets are circling the block and negotiators have been silent since July 12. Hollywood has a right to be glum, which may be why Barbie — even Barbie swag — provides a fascinating distraction.
I have been a student of swag over the years and am continually bemused by the way in which it reflects and distorts the mood of its subject matter. No character in Casablanca ever uttered “Play it again, Sam,” but we all wore those T-shirts. Woody Allen even shot a movie with that title.
T-shirts asserting “I’m gonna make you an offer you can’t refuse” were worn by crew members on The Godfather, which didn’t help location scouts who were repeatedly turned away by wary homeowners.
The normally congenial Clint Eastwood was furious when ”Eliza” T-shirts turned up following the wobbly release of Paint Your Wagon. Eastwood famously detested his singing rendition of “I Can Still See Eliza” and felt that his enemies were taunting him with the swag.
The basic plot of Barbie, with all its jolting interruptions and semi-feminist diatribes, is downright traditional compared to those films. Barbie and Ken, like Dorothy in Wizard of Oz, are traveling from Kansas to Oz, except they’re really going from “Barbieland” to Los Angeles with a major stop at Mattel.
While Barbie and Ken are girlfriend-boyfriend, she is haunted by thoughts of death, not lust. Fortunately her friend Weird Barbie is conveniently around to help her re-connect with reality, albeit a weird reality.
Despite its bulging budget ($145 million) and complex messaging, the Barbie shoot was relatively peaceful, according to reports. Gerwig, the director had run into corporate conflicts on her previous movie, an adaption of Little Women (the seventh).
Nearing the end of her shooting schedule, Gerwig made a major change in that Louisa May Alcott plot: Jo March, her heroine, would not get her man but instead would get her book published, which meant more to her.
The studio liked the original ending but Gerwig nonetheless prevailed. Given the historic success of Barbie, it’s doubtful she will encounter any further blowback from studio executives.
Similarly, Barbie never quite “gets” Ken but, on the other hand, she takes showers without water, eats breakfast without cereal and only drives pink automobiles. Ken, too, may prove evanescent — until the sequel.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtZmFzY2luYXRpbmctZGlzdHJhY3Rpb25zLXBldGVyLWJhcnQtMTIzNTQ1NDExNy_SAWJodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4L2JhcmJpZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWZhc2NpbmF0aW5nLWRpc3RyYWN0aW9ucy1wZXRlci1iYXJ0LTEyMzU0NTQxMTcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Mattel stock is poised to benefit in a big way from the expected success of the ""Barbie"" movie, according to a Thursday note from Goldman Sachs.
The movie, starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, is expected to beat Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and become the number one movie in America this weekend.
Domestic box-office forecasts for the ""Barbie"" debut range from as low as $75 million, which is a conservative estimate from producer Warner Brothers, to as high as $159 million, according to projections from BoxOffice Pro. The movie has positive reviews with a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Mattel is set to benefit from the ""Barbie"" movie's success as a strong performance at the box office could translate into higher sales of Barbie products and lead the company to develop more content tied to its intellectual property.

Goldman Sachs raised its Mattel price target to $24, representing potential upside of 13% from current levels. These are the three factors that could help Mattel benefit from the potential success of the ""Barbie"" movie.
1. Licensing opportunities
While Mattel is set to collect licensing fees directly from the movie's box-office sales, it also has inked new licensing deals for various products that should help boost its licensing revenue.
""Mattel has engaged in dozens of partnerships that license the Barbie brand to popular consumer retail companies in order to elevate awareness and enthusiasm among consumers well beyond the traditional doll,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Stephen Laszczyk said. ""We believe that Mattel is collecting licensing fees from each brand for the right to license the Barbie logo/imagery for their own products. We estimate that typical licensing fees of this nature range from 10% to 20% of product revenues.""
2. Lower marketing costs for Barbie brand
""The enthusiasm around the Barbie film from both social media and the press has generated similar enthusiasm for these licensed consumer products, and consequently for the more classic Barbie toys Mattel sells directly. We believe this potentially reduces the need for Mattel to advertise its products in the near-to-medium-term,"" Laszczyk said.

3. Increased toy sales
The satirical nature and PG-13 rating of the ""Barbie"" movie suggest it is mostly targeting adults, not young kids, which means Mattel may not benefit from a big sales boost for its toys. But...
""We believe that toy sales will benefit from a 'halo effect' over the medium-to-longer-term as adults, who may gain a renewed affinity for the brand because of the movie, become more inclined to gift Barbie with the next occasion. As a result, we believe that it is more likely that Barbie's seasonal sales cycle is amplified as a result of the movie rather than altered by a near-term spike in demand,"" Laszczyk said.
A bonus reason exists for Mattel stock to benefit from the ""Barbie"" movie, and that's the possibility of Mattel licensing more of its intellectual property for content creation, according to the note. Mattel's Hot Wheels toy line already has a movie in the works, being produced by J.J. Abrams with an expected release date in 2025.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL2JhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1tYXR0ZWwtc3RvY2stcHJpY2UtdXBzaWRlLW1hdC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWVzdGltYXRlcy0yMDIzLTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Hate sells. Just ask Jason Aldean. But the 'Barbie' box office domination is a ray of hope,"Jason Aldean's ""Try That in a Small Town"" is No. 2 song in the US, riding a wave of hateful images. But ""Barbie"" is the No. 1 movie. Why that matters.","Not everyone was excited about “Barbie” hitting theater screens.
In the massive run-up to the film, directed by Greta Gerwig, some conservative blowhards began baying their new mantra, suitable for use concerning anything they don’t agree with: go woke, go broke. (I even got an email using the slogan.)
Surely the man-hating message of this movie they hadn’t actually seen would keep good Americans at home, watching reruns of “Duck Dynasty” or, who knows, maybe they would buy a ticket for “Oppenheimer.” The U.S. blows stuff up in that one, after all.
How’d that work out?
Pretty great for “Barbie.” The movie made more than $162 million in its first weekend, the biggest opening so far this year and the largest opening ever for a woman director. It also won massive critical acclaim to go along with its massive box-office haul.
But quality isn’t a concern for the anti-woke crowd. Outrage is.
Tequila, books and 'new territories:'Olivia Fierro talks life after 'Good Morning Arizona'
'Try That in a Small Town' is the No. 2 song in the country
Let’s face it, hate sells. But maybe “Barbie” can save us.
With “Try That in a Small Town,” Jason Aldean now has the No. 2 song on the Billboard Hot 100 — for a song that was released in May but didn’t take off till the music video inflamed passions.
The song basically champions the virtues of small towns, if you consider taking the law into your own hands a virtue. (“Vigilante” is the word, I think.)
And no, that’s not overstating things. Here’s the chorus: “Well, try that in a small town/See how far ya make it down the road/Around here, we take care of our own/You cross that line, it won't take long/For you to find out, I recommend you don’t/Try that in a small town.”
Worse, the video originally included images of a Black Lives Matter demonstration — including footage projected onto the wall of a Tennessee courthouse where a Black teenager was lynched in the 1920s.
Yeah, just regular stuff. Aldean has said the song has nothing to do with race. But it’s worth noting the Black Lives Matter footage has since been edited out of the video. (Aldean's record label said it was edited ""due to third-party clearance issues."")
Bud Light backlash proves the power of hate works both ways
It works both ways. Hate is a powerful tool that can drive down sales, as well. On Thursday, Anheuser-Busch said it was laying off hundreds of employees after a backlash against Bud Light knocked the beer from its perch as the No. 1 beer in the U.S.
And what caused the backlash? Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.
The horror!
There was reliable lunatic Kid Rock shooting cans of Bud Light, to the great surprise of no one, in protest. What a hero. Seriously, though, isn’t one of the conservative values to live and let live? Evidently not.
It’s depressing. But “Barbie” offers hope.

Ben Shapiro ranted against 'Barbie,' then set dolls on fire
Though not without some effort. Attention seekers like conservative media figure Ben Shapiro went out of their way to trash the movie, though at least Shapiro watched it first. Then he made a 43-minute video trashing it — the movie itself is only 114 minutes long — calling it a “flaming garbage heap of a film.”
While wearing, the internet helpfully pointed out, an outfit identical to the one Ken wears in a dance number.
He also throws Barbie and Ken into a trash can and lights them on fire. Again, just normal stuff.
And then there’s “Barbie” itself.
The film, written by Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, does offer criticism of certain types of toxic masculinity and ridicules blind adherence to the patriarchy. It also champions strong, independent women. To some, of course, this is practically a call to arms. If you’re dumb enough to go around lighting dolls on fire because you didn’t like a movie, anything is.
But the criticism Gerwig delivers in her film isn't rooted in hate. It’s smart, it’s funny and it’s serious when it needs to be. But it threatens no one. If anyone is truly offended by it, then the movie probably hits a little too close to home.
Here’s a thought: Stop throwing tantrums. If you want to listen to “Try That in a Small Town,” listen to it as a song, not a we’ll-show-them political statement. If you don’t want to see “Barbie,” simply don’t see it.
But it’s your loss.

What more to say about the summer of “Barbie”? I think I can admit, now that I’ve been thoroughly proven wrong, that I was only moderately excited about this movie. That I had three or four Barbie-universe dolls growing up, that they neither scarred me nor particularly inspired me, that for 25 years I’ve remembered that one of them was named “Keiko,” but a quick Google has just informed me that Keiko was apparently the name not of the doll but of the doll’s accessory killer whale (??).
On opening weekend, I took myself to a “Barbie” matinee and ended up loving it. But after a monsoon of coverage about Barbie fashion and Barbie feminism, and actress America Ferrera’s fiery monologue in the movie (“It is literally impossible to be a woman”) and commentator Matt Walsh’s brainwormy monologue about the movie (It’s a “man-hating sledgehammer”), and after think pieces about how “Barbie” was uplifting girls and saving cinema — after all that, it seemed like there couldn’t possibly be anything more to add.

Then, last week, the movie set a record. It became the first film solely directed by a woman to break the $1 billion box office. Only 28 male directors have ever reached that benchmark either, and “Barbie’s” Greta Gerwig got there with remarkable speed — faster than any movie in Warner Bros. history, the studio’s president of domestic distribution told the New York Times.
This is the final word on “Barbie.” It’s spelled out with numbers, and it adds up to this: The movie made more because it showed us more. Women doing more, wanting more, being more. (And, as it ultimately turns out — Kens, too.)
For anyone who ever elbowed through a swarm of cosplaying Captain Americas at the opening night of a Marvel flick, and who believed that superhero worship was a guy thing, “Barbie” was the rebuttal. Women unearthed pink they didn’t even know they had and showed up at multiplexes in droves. At my theater, I saw a group of resplendently dressed elderly Black women, six or seven college-aged Muslim women in matching pink hijabs, and a bachelorette party of blondes.

Women needed this, is what I’m saying. All kinds of women, in a melting-planet July, in a disappearing-bodily-autonomy post-Roe America, needed to sit in air-conditioned darkness and watch something with smart dialogue, elaborate dance sequences, Ryan Gosling, a chase sequence and a Bechdel test passed with flying colors. The movie has come to be a lightning rod in current culture, but it’s also just really fun.
A quick refresher: The movie follows the adventures of Stereotypical Barbie, who is played by Margot Robbie and who lives in the matriarchal paradise of Barbieland along with many Scientist Barbies and Politician Barbies and Supreme Court Justice Barbies. One morning, her world goes mysteriously wonky — her high-heeled feet fall flat; she becomes aware of her own mortality — which turns out to be because the woman who once played with her in the real world (Ferrera) is also struggling. Doll and woman must team up to get things back on track before Ken, who has been massively red-pilled by his own visit to the real world, turns Barbie’s Dreamhouse into the “Mojo Dojo Casa House” and changes the constitution to take away the Barbies’ power.
If you participated in “Barbenheimer” — making a double feature out of “Barbie” and World War II epic “Oppenheimer” — you might have noticed that the mojo-dojo patriarchy of Ken’s dreams was essentially the state of affairs in Los Alamos, N.M.: a rugged frontier where scientist men (plus exactly one scientist woman) carried out the orders of politician men and military men, where wives were left to fold laundry or mix drinks or, if they were especially lucky, take dictation.
Does that mean that “Oppenheimer” was, to flip Matt Walsh’s phrase, a “woman-hating sledgehammer”? No, of course not. What it means is that the men who populated that world were doing serious, monumental work, and the interior lives and needs of the women surrounding them were an afterthought.
Advertisement
The female residents of Barbieland don’t hate the Kens who live there. They just don’t think much about the Kens who live there. They’ve got a country to run and lives to lead, and a nightly slumber party requiring sequins.
I can see why a commentator like Walsh, who admitted he hadn’t actually seen “Barbie” and had no plans to, would misinterpret this dismissiveness as an affront to men. But for the women buying popcorn, it was a revelation. Do you have any idea how liberating it is to imagine a society in which women do not need to plan their attire, their speech, their behaviors and their routines with male reactions in mind? Where women’s interior lives are more interesting than their romantic ones? Gerwig, who also wrote and directed “Lady Bird” and the 2019 adaptation of “Little Women,” has become a master of that form, and of recognizing that a cinematic experience isn’t “niche” if it’s targeting a full 50 percent of the population.
In one of the most biting scenes in the “Barbie” movie, Ken announced that it was time to sing “at” Barbie, pulled out his guitar and began to strum the chorus of Matchbox Twenty’s “Push.” As Barbie sat frozen on-screen, smiling through her discomfort, a woman in my theater shouted: “GOD. NO.”

It seemed obvious she had been there, sung at, and had no desire to ever return.
Here’s the thing, though — and, spoiler alert. At the end of the movie, Ken doesn’t succeed in overthrowing the government of Barbieland. But he does articulate that living in Barbie’s world has felt hurtful and diminishing to him, and that he wants more. And Barbie realizes that she wants more, too. That a plastic world in which one group of people gets jobs like president and astronaut and one group of people gets jobs like “beach” isn’t going to satisfy her anymore. She’d rather get wrinkles and make gynecological appointments in the real world.
It’s a lovely idea. It’s worth a billion dollars.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMy8wOC8xNC9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtYm94LW9mZmljZS1tZWFuaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Barbie with already $394.5M in the bank stateside will cross the $400M mark today on her 14th day in release (I previously mis-counted), besting the 18-day runs to that box office benchmark of Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie which crossed that domestic point in 18 days.
Paramount is still spotting low to mid $30M for the Nickelodeon/Point Grey animated Turtles movie which got an A CinemaScore by moviegoers. Others believe it could easily go north of $40M. Wednesday’s number includes the $3.85M the pic made in its Tuesday previews.
On the upside, Mutant Mayhem made more in its opening day than the first Friday of the previous animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, TMNT, back in 2007; that pic doing $8.7M and a 3-day of $24.2M. TMNT also had an A- CinemaScore, but was panned by critics at 36%. Mutant Mayhem has won reviewers over at 94% certified fresh.
I’m told there’s no comps for Mutant Mayhem when it comes to animated movies opening on a non-holiday Wednesday, so let’s look at the closest thing we got: cartoon movies that debuted on a Wednesday, but over a holiday. Mutant Mayhem‘s first day isn’t far from Sing‘s $11M Wednesday which turned into $55.8M 5-day boasted by Christmas, and it’s ahead of Sing 2‘s $8.1M which did $39.5M over 5 days, also fueled by Christmas. Anyway, Mutant Mayhem is finding its way in a marketplace dominated by Barbie and Oppenheimer, the latter seeing $5.7M yesterday for a running total of $194.1M. This weekend, Oppenheimer will overtake the domestic box office gross for Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins ($206.8M).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1tdXRhbnQtbWF5aGVtLWJhcmJpZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLTEyMzU0NTQwODQv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC90ZWVuYWdlLW11dGFudC1uaW5qYS10dXJ0bGVzLW11dGFudC1tYXloZW0tYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtMTIzNTQ1NDA4NC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Together, Barbenheimer was a massive success. Here's how the two movies divided the nation:
States take sides on 'Barbenheimer'
Americans have been web-searching for ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer,"" and in every state but two, there was a clear winner. The winning states for ""Oppenheimer"" may come as a surprise. More people searched for the Christopher Nolan film in California than they did for ""Barbie,"" where the movie was filmed. There's even a Barbie DreamHouse available for rent in Malibu.
There can only be one winner (except, in this case, we grant two ties). Which movie won out in each state?
Memes went viral over the weekend for comparing the search popularity of the two films in each state, with some even comparing it to the 2020 U.S. electoral map.

The film's more than $162 million in weekend sales is not only the best opening of the year, but it's also the most successful opening weekend for a film with a female director.

Hollywood's biggest weekend at the box office in years wasn't fueled by superheroes, Jedi or the promise of a sequel. Sure, there were big names: Barbie, the iconic fashion doll; Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb; and, of course, directors Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan. But what set ""Barbenheimer"" weekend apart was fresh storytelling, a fear of missing out on a cultural moment and a desire to experience movies on the biggest screen possible. ""They did a great job of positioning it as a movie that not only needed to be seen in theaters, but needed to be seen with your friends in a theater,"" said Mike Polydoros, CEO at cinema marketing firm PaperAirplane Media.
'At a crossroads'
The historic box office combination of Warner Bros. Discovery's ""Barbie"" and Universal's ""Oppenheimer"" arrived at a time when even the most dependable franchise movies have failed to lure in audiences. Marvel and DC movies aren't pulling in the same ticket sales as they did before the Covid-19 pandemic, nor are new installments in film series such as Mission Impossible, Fast and Furious, Indiana Jones and Transformers. Movie nostalgia is no longer enough to inspire consumers to leave their couches for cinemas. ""The industry is at a crossroads,"" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""The success of 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie' shows why studios need to start thinking more outside the box while allowing creative talent the room to do what they do best. Gone are the days when a brand can simply be slapped onto a product and people be expected to show up in droves just because they have before or because an algorithm suggests they will.""
Together, ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" generated $244.5 million during their first three days in theaters — $162 million for ""Barbie"" and $82.5 million for ""Oppenheimer."" Adding ticket sales from Paramount's newest ""Mission: Impossible"" film, Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" and Angel Studios' ""The Sound of Freedom,"" the weekend box office topped $311 million, the fourth-highest weekend haul in history.

The FOMO effect
""Barbenheimer's"" historic weekend was also fueled by a sense of urgency, which the box office has been lacking in recent months. ""A fear of missing out on such a special moment motivated people to see one or both, perhaps sooner than they ordinarily would have,"" Robbins said. Audiences were drawn to see ""Oppenheimer"" on the biggest screen possible, or in specialty theaters that showed the exclusive 70mm footage of Nolan's biopic. Nolan's films have come to be event cinema, as the director shies away from computer-generated images in favor of practical effects and is known for creating powerful visuals. As for ""Barbie,"" a huge draw for audiences was the communal experience of donning bubblegum pink and going out in large groups, and, of course, Gerwig, who is known for her sharp, witty dialogue and focus on female-driven stories.
Another piece of the appeal was the fact that the two films were so drastically different. ""They compounded one another's success via the Barbenheimer meme, as it organically took over the pop culture consciousness and crossed over into mainstream channels that don't normally include movies in their casual daily discourse,"" Robbins said. He noted that both films would have been box-office hits regardless, but ""the mystique of them opening on the same day elevated their profiles to an entirely new level."" The meme-worthy trend of seeing both in the same day drove hundreds of thousands of people to cinemas over the weekend. Typically, two films arriving on the same weekend from rival studios would lead to cannibalization of ticket sales.

2023-07-10 21:56:09+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Is Out Of The Box In A Big Way, But Can It Bring Comedy Back To The Oscars Too?","Warner Bros new summer comedy Barbie landed big laughs at its world premiere Sunday, but can it break Oscar's comedy curse and score with Academy?","Comedy doesn’t always have the easiest time being taken seriously come Oscar season. Movies based on established toy brands don’t, either. But, based on reaction to Sunday night’s huge world premiere at the Shrine in downtown Los Angeles, as well as my own feelings watching it with the packed crowd of first-nighters, Barbie just may have the stuff to not only become a smash box office hit this summer (I would now guarantee it), but also a surprising genuine awards contender for Warner Bros and Mattel (I can’t believe I just wrote that sentence).
The formal review embargo is set for July 18 following critics screenings (Deadline’s Valerie Complex will be reviewing), but the social media embargo lifted at the conclusion of last night’s screening and initial reactions are rampant. For my money this is a razor-sharp, hilarious and totally fun movie that more than lives up to my hopes based on the fact the script comes from Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, the latter also the director. It delivers on every front, but gets gravitas from its sly satirical commentary on society’s ever-changing and challenging place of men vs. women. A feminist manifesto? Not quite. It has more complexity than you might think, and nothing is held back. Props also have to go to Mattel for letting these supremely talented filmmakers go wild with the beloved brand, even in unflattering ways.
“What a smart movie this was, so fun but with so much to say, too,” one filmgoer told me as she exited the Shrine last night to head to the after-party. That person happened to be Janet Yang, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and her effusive reaction (just one of many similar I heard afterwards) led me to think, despite its genre and July release, that Barbie could have some real potential come Oscar time, even as Warners tees up other more obvious hopefuls in the fall like Dune Part Two and the film adaptation of the Broadway musical version of The Color Purple.
Comedy, or actually more broad comedy like Barbie, usually gets treated like a second-class citizen at the Academy Awards with some exceptions — like Tootsie, which made it into the Best Picture race; Tom Jones, which won; Some Like It Hot, which got a few nominations; more recently Adam McKay films like Don’t Look Up; and movies like The Producers, Pillow Talk, Moonstruck and others over the years that took home screenplay Oscars in their time. Broad comedy master Mel Brooks is getting an honorary Oscar in November, so that’s high acknowledgement of the genre. Even this year the Academy showed by anointing Everything Everywhere All at Once with its highest honor that it is willing to look more out of the box, something Barbie would be literally and figuratively.
‘Barbie’ Warner Bros
Because this is a movie that sneaks up on you and has more of an acidly witty Billy Wilder sensibility to it, I could see it playing surprisingly well with the Academy. It is as relevant as it is LOL funny. For starters in crafts categories like Sarah Greenwood’s bright Production Design, Jacqueline Durran’s Costume Design, and Rodrigo Prieto’s candy technicolored cinematography, it could be a real player. Original songs like Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” and the rollicking Ryan Gosling-led production number “I’m Just Ken” could compete for Best Song. Both Gosling and title star Margot Robbie deserve consideration in the lead categories for pitch perfect performances that also have a real shot to gain momentum at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. Gosling in particular is real scene stealer. Baumbach and Gerwig’s script could have a lot of support for Original Screenplay. Whether Barbie gets into Picture and Director races remains to be seen, but if the movie becomes a bit of a phenomenon following its opening than don’t count it out.

On another front, despite their widely divergent differences, the social media-tagged “Barbenheimer” connection with Christopher Nolan’s A-Bomb drama Oppenheimer, a film that on the surface at least would appear to be genuine Oscar-bait material, might also help it in a weird way. Exhibition reports significant numbers of moviegoers are even planning to the see the dueling July 21 openers on the same day. Go figure.

Warner Bros. Pictures
The year 2023 has really turned out to be the year of the product biopic, and the good news is so far each one of them are really good. Ben Affleck’s Nike Air Jordan tale, Air, grossed over $50 million in theaters. The superb smartphone origin story BlackBerry was critically acclaimed, as was the backstory of a video game in Tetris that played like a nail-biting spy thriller on Apple. Eva Longoria’s lively and heartfelt tale of the emergence of spicy Cheetos, Flamin’ Hot, has been a hit on both Disney+ and Hulu since debuting in June. Now we have Barbie ready to take the trend to new levels. Opening in limited theatrical the same day, and then streaming on Apple starting July 28, is another brand marketing saga, The Beanie Bubble with Zach Galifianakis and Elizabeth Banks, which chronicles the rapid rise of Ty’s Beanie Babies phenomenon.
For me it is just heartening to see comedy in a position to really spark a comeback, especially after Jennifer Lawrence’s terrific No Hard Feelings continues to play well and draw solid word of mouth this summer, albeit on a smaller scale. It will be fascinating to see just how far Barbie can take that baton and run with it. At the very least there are some much-needed laughs to be had.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvY2FuLWJhcmJpZS1icmluZy1jb21lZHktYmFjay10by1vc2NhcnMtMTIzNTQzMzQwNS_SAVNodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2Nhbi1iYXJiaWUtYnJpbmctY29tZWR5LWJhY2stdG8tb3NjYXJzLTEyMzU0MzM0MDUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

What are some of the most packed movie screenings at the Maya Cinemas Fresno 16 in Fresno, California, these days? “Oppenheimer?” The multiplex’s dozen daily showings of “Barbie?” Actually, it’s the matinees of both.
In the early afternoons, when temperatures in central California have been circling triple-digits, people start heading into the theaters, said assistant manager Hope Torres. The heat is boosting attendance, she said — and the uptick started even before those blockbuster films opened. Maya Cinemas Fresno 16 keeps the thermostat at 68-70 degrees Fahrenheit, stocks up on frozen drinks and “when people come into the theater, they comment on how nice the air conditioning feels,” Torres said.

This summer, scorching heat waves are helping take the movie box office to new levels. AMC, the world’s biggest theater chain, on Sunday reported its largest single-week admissions revenue (July 21-27) since the company’s founding in 1920. AMC attributed this 103-year high to the incredible opening weekend of both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” as well as the strong momentum that continued to carry them along.
As high or even record temperatures blanket much of the country, the combination of the cultural moment that is “Barbenheimer” and the movie industry’s inviting air-conditioned theaters are accelerating a return to movie-going.
Box office sales in 2023 are outpacing last year’s by $1 billion, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst with Boxoffice Pro, with movies grossing $5.8 billion through July 30, versus $4.8 billlion in the same period last year.
A lot of that has to do with a strong movie release slate, he said, but record temperatures are contributing to ticket sales. “As we get into July and August, the dog days of summer, the heat can be a determining factor [at the box office].”
Three hours of cool
“Oppenheimer” stretches 180 minutes but that doesn’t seem to be deterring the box office in this climate, maybe just the opposite.
In Phoenix, Arizona, where temperatures have been hitting triple digits, ReelTok podcast host Tyler Whitmore said, “Walking from the parking lot to the theater in 115 degrees in Arizona, it doesn’t take that long to heat up. Luckily, ‘Oppenheimer’ is 3 hours long.”
Whitmore has air conditioning at home, he noted. But in movie houses, he gets to enjoy it “without running up the electricity bill.”
Theaters have been using air conditioning as a marketing draw for decades, said Salvatore Basile, author of “Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything”. He explained: “Movie theaters would open their front doors so that those passing by would feel a blast of cold air and decide to buy tickets.” This early marketing technique was called “advertising air.”
Of course, many people have air conditioners at home, or fans, but they can be pricey to run and not as efficient as movie-house behemoths. Movie-theater air conditioning is generally silent, powerful and adapts quickly to temperature swings. It has to, noted the Hollywood Reporter, in a 2013 look at the history of AC in cinemas. The publication reported this is because theaters cycle from empty to full regularly, with some rooms packed while others have few guests. (Some people can even get too cold in air-conditioned rooms.)
‘Escape the heatwave at Cineworld’
The crowds couldn’t come soon enough for some in the movie industry.
Cineworld, the owner of Regal Cinemas, announced Tuesday that it had emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy after slashing billions off its debts, just as smash hits such as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” give the movie theater industry a much-needed lift.
(“Barbie” is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

Cineworld didn’t credit AC, but in June, the UK-based chain had a campaign inviting guests to “Escape the heatwave and cool off at Cineworld.”
AC changed the movie industry. Within 5 years of the introduction of air conditioning in movie theaters in the 1920s, Basile said, 3,000 movie theaters were forced to put it in just to keep up with the industry. “Before air conditioning existed in movie theaters, summer was considered the dead season.” Not anymore.
“Summer is movie-time,” said Michael O’Leary, CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners. “It is the prime time to go to movie theaters.”
More people than usual this year showed up for The Loft Cinemas’ annual 12-hour Slumber party Sci-Fi marathon in June, said Jeff Yanc, program director of the Tucson, Arizona, theater. It was a sweltering 90 degrees that night and, in the face of the heat, moviegoers were able to sit back and watch six consecutive films indoors.
The audience may have been there mostly for the night’s bill, he said, which included John Carpenter’s 1988 “They Live!” and “Mantango: Attack of the Mushroom People.”
“But it is nice to be in an air-conditioned building for twelve hours,” Yanc said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9tb3ZpZS10aGVhdGVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYWlyLWNvbmRpdGlvbmluZy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wOC8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9tb3ZpZS10aGVhdGVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYWlyLWNvbmRpdGlvbmluZy9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:21:00+00:00,An Exhaustive List of (Almost) Every Single Reference in the Barbie Movie,"Greta Gerwig drew inspiration from unlikely sources such as Grease, Top Gun, and Sylvester Stallone when dreaming up the film.","This post contains spoilers for Barbie
During the filming of Barbie, Margot Robbie’s production company LuckyChap hosted a film festival of sorts for the cast and crew that would serve as inspiration for the movie. Robbie, the star of Barbie and its producer, had long discussed with writer-director Greta Gerwig how the visual palette of the film would draw from images ranging from the stagecraft of 1950s musicals to the color pops in Jacques Demy films. And the movie’s many jokes riff on some of the most popular moments in cinematic history, from the introduction of 2001: A Space Odyssey to The Matrix and even (surprisingly) The Snydercut of Justice League.
It’s virtually impossible to compile an exhaustive list of every single reference made in Barbie. Gerwig and her partner and co-writer Noah Baumbach have stuffed it with so many gags and nods to various pieces of art that only multiple viewings will reveal all of the film’s secrets. But here is every Easter egg that we could find.

2001: A Space Odyssey
The internet has been chattering about this one ever since the first teaser trailer for Barbie dropped. That spot spoofed 2001′s famous opening scene by replacing apes with little girls smashing their baby dolls when they discover the first doll who looks like an actual grown woman: Barbie.
Pygmalion
On a plot level, Gerwig and Baumbach are drawing inspiration from the Greek myth of Pygmalion (as written by Ovid), a sculptor who creates a statue meant to represent the perfect woman and then falls in love with his own creation. The story has been adapted many times over, including in George Bernard Shaw’s play of the same name and the musical My Fair Lady. In this case, Ruth Handler is the creator and Barbie is supposed to represent the perfect woman. Gerwig explores the impossibility of a single doll representing an entire gender, not only by adding a multiplicity of Barbies to the movie (played by different actors) but by showing how Barbie’s supposed perfection rubs some of the human girls who play with her the wrong way. Like the statue Galatea in Pygmalion, Barbie eventually does “come to life” by venturing into the real world, learning about death, and trading her Dream Life for an existence that’s more flawed but rewarding.

The Philadelphia Story
Gerwig told Letterboxd that she asked Margot Robbie to watch Katharine Hepburn’s performance in The Philadelphia Story as inspiration for Barbie. In that movie, the incomparable Hepburn plays a woman who is worshipped by men, like a goddess, because she is so cold and distant. It is only when she begins to fall apart emotionally in the film that she discovers something new about herself. Similarly, Gerwig envisioned a movie in which Barbie’s perfect world is punctured by thoughts about mortality, and it’s only then that Barbie begins to discover the beauty of life.
The Wizard of Oz
A classic tale of a young woman venturing into an unknown land, Barbie is kind of Wizard of Oz in reverse: Barbie travels from what we would consider a wonderland to the real world. Barbieland has a pink brick road in place of a yellow brick road, and if you look closely you’ll see The Wizard of Oz is displayed on the marquee of the Barbieland cinema.
Clueless
Barbie’s getting-ready routine pays homage to another fashion-forward blonde, Alicia Silverstone’s Cher, brushing her hair and browsing her high-tech closet in Clueless. In the Architectural Digest tour of Barbie’s Dreamhouse, Robbie talks about how Clueless set the high bar for cinematic closets, one that the crew of Barbie tried to meet. Just like Cher, Barbie will go on to discover that there is a deeper meaning to life than clothes.
Read More: We’re Ignoring the Real Reason Barbie Might Dominate the Box Office
An American in Paris
Barbie’s mornings also mimic how Gene Kelly’s character wakes up and gets ready in American in Paris. Gerwig actually references quite a few Gene Kelly movies in Barbie. We’ll talk about Singin’ in the Rain later.
The Truman Show
Gerwig talked to The Truman Show director Peter Weir about how he shot his movie about a man unknowingly living on a reality TV set. Not only does Barbieland mimic the artificiality of The Truman Show in concept, but Gerwig and Weir discussed how to physically light their sets to capture that feeling.
The films of Jacques Demy
Gerwig has credited the French filmmaker with inspiring how she layered colors (particularly different shades of pink) in Barbie so everything would pop instead of clash. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The Young Girls of Rochefort, and Model Shop all served as aesthetic inspiration.

Saturday Night Fever
The disco number at the beginning of the movie (which is briefly interrupted by Barbie querying her fellow dolls as to whether they ever have thoughts of death) is an homage to John Travolta’s dances in Saturday Night Fever, down to the costuming.
The Red Shoes
Kate McKinnon plays Weird Barbie—a Barbie that’s been played with too hard and so has a wonky haircut and marker scribbles all over her face. When Robbie’s Barbie begins having thoughts of death, the other Barbies in Barbieland urge her to visit Weird Barbie for answers. Gerwig modeled the scene of Barbie walking up the stars to Weird Barbie’s abode on a scene from Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell’s 1948 romantic drama The Red Shoes. The soundstage feel of that movie heavily influenced the look of Barbieland.
The Matrix
Weird Barbie is the mystical guide you see in a typical adventure movie, laying out the quest. At the end of her spiel, Weird Barbie offers Robbie’s Barbie two options, represented by two shoes: Choose the stiletto heel and stay in Barbieland or choose the Birkenstock and venture into the real world. It’s a riff on the Red Pill-Blue Pill moment from The Matrix.
Read More: Every Single Barbie Partnership That We Could Find
Proust
While Barbie is on the run in the real world, the Mattel executives are endeavoring to put her back in her box. The smell of said box triggers a Proustian sense memory from Barbie of her birth. (In Remembrance of Things Past, a bite of a madeleine has a similar effect on a character.) Will Ferrell’s CEO character then cracks a joke about how poorly “Proust Barbie” sold.
The Shining
When Barbie ventures from Barbieland into the real world to figure out why she is suddenly having thoughts of death, she discovers that a mom named Gloria (America Ferrera) has been playing with her and has essentially imprinted on Barbie. When they meet, they realize they’re having the same thoughts of death, of depression, and of cellulite. Gloria’s daughter, when she discovers this information, asks her mom if she and Barbie are “shining” right now, a reference to the mystical ability to establish a telepathic connection in the Stephen King’s horror story The Shining.
Top Gun
When Barbie returns to Barbieland, she finds that the beach where the Barbies usually play volleyball has been overrun by Kens. The Barbies are instead serving as fawning cheerleaders. It’s the first hint that the power dynamics of the matriarchal Barbieland have suddenly flipped. You cannot have a bunch of Kens playing shirtless beach volley ball on the beach and not be referencing that scene in Top Gun.
Sylvester Stallone’s penchant for mink coats
Sylvester Stallone apparently had a thing for fur, often donning mink coats and fuzzy vests in the ’70s. When Ken discovers the patriarchy, he adopts the look in a bid for macho cool.
Read More: How Greta Gerwig Is Leading By Example
The Snydercut
Yes, Barbie makes fun of Mattel. But the movie gets in a few barbs directed at studio Warner Bros. as well. When the Kens turn Barbieland into a Kendom, they essentially hypnotize the Barbies into becoming housewives. Gloria, Barbie, and others have to remind all the zoned-out Barbies that they’re actually accomplished writers and doctors and politicians in order to overthrow the patriarchy in Barbieland. When one of the Barbies, played by Alexandra Shipp, wakes up from her daze, she says, “It’s like I’ve been in a dream where I was really invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League,” which if you followed the toxic (male-driven) online campaign around that movie as closely as I had to for work, is pretty hilarious.
The Godfather
Once each Barbie snaps out of her daze, she is sent to distract a Ken while another Barbie is stolen away and reprogrammed by Robbie’s Barbie and Gloria. Issa Rae’s President Barbie pretends to be interested in Simu Liu mansplaining Francis Ford Coppola’s cinematic masterpiece The Godfather. In one of the funnier line readings in the film, she asks “Oh, are you watching The Godfather,” putting the emphasis on the wrong syllable to seem ditzy. Liu’s Ken jumps at the chance to talk over the entire movie in a bid to impress her.
Grease
The Barbies eventually trick the Kens into breaking into two factions and fighting one another. The fight turns into a dance-0ff, and Ken’s numbers in Barbie have a “Greased Lightnin'” vibe, especially when Ken wears all black like Travolta.
West Side Story
The other ultra-famous musical involving rival gangs: one can’t help but think during the Battle of the Kens of the many different iterations of the rumble in West Side Story, which usually mashes up dance and fight choreography.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail
When the realize they’ve been tricked, all the Kens ride on imaginary horses across the Kendom. The sight gag recalls a famous recurring joke in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in which the knights ride fake horses while their squires hit coconuts together behind them to imitate horses’ feet.
Singin’ in the Rain
The entire aesthetic of Barbieland has a purposeful Golden Age of Hollywood feel to it. The backdrops, including the sky, are hand-painted to give the movie that specific feeling of soundstage musicals from the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s. When the Kens are fighting on the beach the background suddenly changes to a pastel background with the Kens dressed in monotones. They perform a rather balletic number which, set against that backdrop, recalls Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse’s famous dream-within-a-dream dance in Singin’ in the Rain.

The Sistine Chapel
As Greta Gerwig shared with me for TIME’s cover story on Barbie, there are two shots in the movie in which Barbie’s hand touches that of Ruth Handler, Barbie’s creator. The trajectory of their hands is modeled after the specific positioning of God’s and Adam’s hands in Michaelangelo’s Creation of Man painted on the Sistine Chapel. In this case, Ruth Handler is God to her creation, Barbie, who as a doll has long represented all women.

The audience was 65 percent female. “For a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female — we got a ton of guys,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “It exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.”

Some theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight “Barbie” and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.
Another theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.
The question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing — that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.
There are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, and studios.
“Oppenheimer” helped fuel “Barbie” and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan’s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjMvbW92aWVzL2JhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW51bWJlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,"Even the stars of ‘Barbenheimer’ love the unlikely summer box office rivalry, ‘It’s a perfect double bill,’ says Margot Robbie","Both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" come out July 21 and an unlikely love/hate relationship is brewing.","The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.
It’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.
There’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”
It didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.
Both movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.
“’Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”
AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.
“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”
Cruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.
“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.
“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.
The showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.
One has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.
“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.
Is the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.
There is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.
And social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.
“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.
The official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.
“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”
Still, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.
Still even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.
Back in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).
The bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.
But with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.
“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”

,'Talk to Me' Sequel in the Works from A24 After Original's Breakout Success,"Danny and Michael Philippou, the brother duo who directed the horror movie, will return for the sequel 'Talk 2 Me'","Brace yourself for more Talk to Me.
On Tuesday, A24 announced plans for a sequel to the horror movie, which the distributor picked up after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival.
The next installment, Talk 2 Me will be written by Danny Philippou and Bill Hinzman and directed by Danny and Michael Philippou, the real-life brothers and former YouTubers who directed Talk to Me.
The well-reviewed Talk to Me hit theaters on July 28 and earned over $10 million on its opening weekend, A24's biggest box office debut since 2018's Hereditary, according to Deadline.
Talk to Me is about a group of Australian teens who peer-pressure each other into letting spirits possess their bodies for 90 seconds at parties. They accomplish the feat by holding a creepy embalmed hand. Things take a turn for the bloody when Mia (Sophie Wilde) gets hooked on communicating with her late mother.
The directors told The Hollywood Reporter last month they had ideas for followup movies.
""Part of me is like, ‘Yeah, maybe it is done.' The other part of me is like, ‘Oh, my God. Give me a sequel, please,' "" said Danny. ""I’ve got these set pieces that I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, I so badly want to shoot this. This is the coolest thing ever.' ""
""So, if A24 came to me and said, ‘You know what? We’d like a sequel.’ I wouldn’t be able to resist. I’d want to do it so bad,"" he added.

Michael said, “I guess a question would be, would you continue the story around Mia and those characters, or do you go to another part of the world? That’s a debate.""
A24 has another horror franchise that's also expanding. After the dual success of slashers X and Pearl in 2022, the trilogy will be rounded out with the upcoming MaXXXine, again starring Mia Goth.
Talk to Me is in theaters now.

Warner Bros.’ comedic feature take on girl toy Barbie starring Margot Robbie in the title role and Ryan Gosling as Ken cruised onto tracking today, and hot would be a modest way of describing the box office outlook here. While Warners conservatively is saying $60M, tracking shows that Barbie is bigger than last month’s The Little Mermaid in pulling in general audiences and young women under 25. A weekend start of $80M minimum is what we’re hearing, and that too is a tampered-down expectation because Barbie on paper has all the glitz for a potential $100M start. Little Mermaid‘s 3-day over the Memorial Day holiday weekend was $95.5M.
Barbie’s sweet spot is under-35 females and secondarily 35- to 49-year-olds.
Also, Barbie presales at this point in time are pacing ahead of Little Mermaid. At the Wednesday before its opening Little Mermaid counted $19M in advance ticket sales before grossing a first Friday/previews day of $38.1M. Little Mermaid attracted 68% women and 61% between 18-34, with the largest demo being ages 25-34 at 35%.
Now Christopher Nolan’s three-hour movie about the architect of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, isn’t looking at leftovers. As one distribution insider describes its wattage, “It’s as much male and older as Barbie is female and younger.” We’re also hearing that one should not discount the female audience here in attending Oppenheimer, and under/over 25 both are strong too this ensemble pic starring Cillian Murphy in the title role, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and more.
A $40M-to-possible $50M opening is expected here, with the Universal movie having full control of Imax theaters for three weeks. Nolan’s Dunkirk opened to $50.5M and legged out to $189.7M in 2017. You’ll remember that Nolan’s previous film back in August 2020, Tenet, got shuttered theaters opened in the U.S. during Covid (except for LA, NYC and San Francisco) and posted a $20M 5-day gross over Labor Day weekend, including a pre-release in Canada; that film with its hands tied behind its back.
Filling out the rest of the near-$200M weekend over July 21-23 is the second weekend of Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One with around $35M. That’s looking at a franchise-best launch, and it wouldn’t be unheard-of if that movie does $100M in five days over July 12-16.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcHJvamVjdGlvbi0xMjM1NDI3MzcwL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcHJvamVjdGlvbi0xMjM1NDI3MzcwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

AMC Theaters (AMC) hit a revenue record last week, driven by the overwhelming success of the “Barbenheimer” pop culture craze.
In a news release on Sunday, the world’s largest theater chain announced that from July 21-27, it earned its largest single-week admissions revenue since the company’s founding in 1920. AMC attributed this 103-year high to the incredible opening weekend of both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” as well as the strong momentum that continued to carry them along.
“Barbenheimer” had tremendous staying power in its second weekend in theaters, with “Barbie” grossing $93 million and “Oppenheimer” almost $47 million, according to official studio numbers.
Last weekend was AMC’s busiest since the pandemic forced theaters to close in 2020, the company said, and this weekend marked the chain’s third-busiest worldwide since reopening. It reported that 65 AMC locations across 19 states and Washington, DC, set their own box office records this week as well. AMC shares were up about 7% in late-afternoon trading, to about $4.99.
In its opening weekend, Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” had raked in a stunning $162 million domestically, giving the film the biggest debut of 2023. It’s also the largest-ever for a female director. Meanwhile, “Oppenheimer” opened at $82.5 million, according to media analytics company Comscore.
Combined, the movies have made more than a billion dollars globally in just 10 days.
(CNN and Warner Bros., which distributed “Barbie,” are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery).

Gerwig became the highest grossing female director of all time, breaking a record previously held by Patty Jenkins, director of ""Wonder Woman.""
The highly anticipated paranoia thriller, ""Oppenheimer"" was directed by Christopher Nolan and released the same weekend as ""Barbie."" The two films collectively generated $244.5 million in North American ticket sales their opening weekend in theaters. “Barbie” brought in $162 million, followed by “Oppenheimer” at $82.5 million.
The Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place since the film's release on July 21.
Movie ticket sales are crawling back to pre-pandemic levels
According to The Numbers, a publicly available database of movie industry statistics, annual tickets sold for 2023 are expected to reach 922 million. That's compared to 2022, where total tickets sold reached 709 million. While 2023 ticket sales are not expected to surpass 2019’s pre-pandemic levels of 1.2 billion, they’re inching closer, partially in service to the global sensation that is ""Barbenheimer.""
Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, said ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" drove a huge social conversation that went above and beyond the internet. The meme of ""Barbenheimer"" caught wildfire, Robbins said. “Everybody heard about it, and everybody outside of movie circles has been talking about it for the last few weeks.” The cultural phenomenon drove non-moviegoers to the theaters, breaking significant box-office records.

“Barbie stands out as one of the very few female-centric, female-targeted blockbusters of the summer,” said Robbins. ""The movie offered something fresh in a summer that’s been jam-packed with franchise sequels.""
Young people are driving a movie-theater comeback
While movie ticket sales and box office numbers are not back to pre-pandemic levels, industry data shows that young people are behind the growing market of moviegoers. About 80% of the ""Barbie"" audience was younger than 35. And 65% of the audience was female, according to data from Box Office Pro.
“The audience driving this rebound has been young.” Robbins said. He pointed to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” as an example of a film playing well to a younger audience.
The year-to-date domestic box office recently crossed the $6 billion mark. The last time this mark was hit in summer was in early July 2019, according to data shared by Robbins.

What is Barbie all about?
Barbie revolves around the titular doll's quest for self-discovery when she stumbles upon minor imperfections in her once seemingly perfect life. Alongside her companion, Ken (Ryan Gosling), she embarks on an adventure into the real world, where they confront challenging issues related to beauty standards and societal norms. Together with Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), Barbie's owner, they bravely face their insecurities and societal pressures, ultimately sparking a profound transformation in the social fabric of Barbieland. Barbie makes a courageous decision to embrace her humanity, embracing a continuously evolving identity as she navigates the real world's complexities.
Barbie review
WION's Shomini Sen wrote in her review of Barbie, ""I would still say that the film very smartly shows how society is and humanises the iconic doll. For decades Barbie has been one of the most popular toys for young girls, setting unrealistic standards of beauty. Sure, Mattel has reinvented the doll and made every girl believe that they can be whatever they want to be - just like their favourite doll, but the narrative of everything being overtly perfect has also done damage to several. Greta, in that sense, spins the narrative and adds a layer of cynicism to Barbieland to show how things are in real. Flawed, depressed, and definitely not perfect- even though the plastic remains constant.""

One of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here’s how Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.
Barbie
Warner Bros. Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M
Domestic Total Range: $120M-$226M
PROS:
Barbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.
As a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.
Outside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer’s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie’s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid‘s comparable period.
CONS:
It’s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That’s especially true given the film’s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Premium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie‘s potential average ticket prices, but—as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience—could have a negative impact on attendance.
While early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.
Oppenheimer
Universal Pictures
July 21, 2023 (WIDE)
Opening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M
Domestic Total Range: $137M-$187M
PROS:
Director Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.
Counter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.
There’s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer‘s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.
Pre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer’s Nope and Nolan’s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film’s theatrical run—particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.
CONS:
Oppenheimer‘s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth—especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan’s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.
Men over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that’s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.
Nolan’s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.

2023-07-31 20:35:05+00:00,'Barbenheimer' is a billion-dollar win for the global box office,Both 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' held tough at the domestic box office in their second weekends.,"Movie posters for ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" are pictured outside the Cinemark Somerdale 16 and XD in Somerdale, New Jersey, 2023.
""Barbenheimer"" remains red-hot at the box office.
The combined force of Warner Bros.' ""Barbie"" and Universal's ""Oppenheimer"" has led to more than $1.1 billion in global ticket sales since July 21.
Domestically, ""Barbenheimer"" saw smaller-than-average second week ticket sales drops as millions of moviegoers headed to cinemas to catch the popular flicks. In fact, both films' ticket sales fell just 43% from their opening weekends.
Typically, blockbuster features will see ticket sales fall between 50% and 70% after the debut weekend. Second week numbers are often looked at by box office analysts as an indicator of whether a film will have longevity at the box office or will fizzle quickly. The smaller the drop, the better.
""'Barbenheimer' will go down as one of the most notable and unforeseeable milestones in the history of cinema not just for what it means to the bottom-line box office dollars for the industry but also as a cultural event centered around moviegoing,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
Over the weekend, ""Barbie"" added $93 million, bringing its domestic haul to $351 million. The Greta Gerwig and Mattel collaboration for Warner Bros. is nearing $800 million worldwide and could become the second billion-dollar film of 2023.
Universal 's ""Oppenheimer,"" meanwhile, tallied another $46.7 million over the weekend. Its domestic gross now stands at $175 million. Globally, it's generated $405 million.
""For a domestic summer marketplace desperately in need of a box office boost, the July 21 simultaneous theatrical debuts of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' set off a chain reaction of overall box office that has infused the all-important season with nearly three quarters of a billion dollars of bonus cash,"" Dergarabedian said.
Heading into ""Barbenheimer's"" first weekend, the summer box office, which runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, was down around 7% compared to 2022. Two weeks later, it's up 9%, according to data from Comscore.
Similarly, the confluence of these two films boosted the overall domestic box office compared with last year's haul to this point. Prior to ""Barbenheimer,"" ticket sales were up 12%. Two weeks later, they were up 20%.
The overall domestic box office still lags behind prepandemic levels by around 16%, however. And prospects for catching up are dwindling as studios have started to move big releases to next year as Hollywood digs in for drawn-out writers' and actors' strikes.

NBCUniversal is the distributor of ""Oppenheimer.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMzEvYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLWdyb3NzZXMtY3Jvc3Nlcy1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1tYXJrLmh0bWzSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wNy8zMS9iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItZ3Jvc3Nlcy1jcm9zc2VzLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLW1hcmsuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,'Barbie's Record-Setting $155 Million Box Office Debut Beats Out 'Oppenheimer's $80 Million,"The movie weekend dubbed,'Barbenheimer' by social media shattered box office records.","Moviegoers were thinking pink this weekend!
According to Variety, Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie exceeded box-office expectations and outsold Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. The trade publication projects that Barbie opened with $155 million -- and is one of the biggest opening weekends of the year.
With the global numbers, Barbie -- starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling -- capped out at $337 million. It wasn't a bad weekend for Nolan's historic drama, starring Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy. The film opened with $80.5 million. Both films opening on the same day sent the internet into a frenzy.
The idea that fans would see the movies as a double feature was officially dubbed, ""Barbenheimer,"" with some fans flocking to the theatre in split pink and black outfits in support of both films. The numbers done by both films, as a combined phenomenon, ranked as the fourth biggest weekend in history.
Still, it was Gerwig's film that took the top spot. The director even made an appearance over the weekend at a screening of the film at the Alamo Draft House in New York City.
Ahead of the film's highly-anticipated release, ET spoke to Margot Robbie (Barbie) who shared her excitement for the film's release and bringing Gerwig's vision to life.
""I am just so excited. We're at the point of sharing it with the world,"" she said. ""There's always that thing when you make a movie and you love it and you care about it so much and you hope that people are gonna like it and even see it. Like even if they don't like it, I just hope they see it and get to form an opinion. But I feel like so many people are gonna see this movie that it's really exciting.""
She added, ""It really is Greta's vision. I mean, the vision for Barbie obviously started 64 years ago, but Greta bringing it into the world today in the way that only Greta Gerwig can is what makes this movie worth making right now.""
Gerwig spoke about telling the iconic doll's story and why it was important for her to bring her to life.
""She's got a long history. She's gone through a lot of changes,"" she said. ""It's so joyful and so fun.... there's almost a delicious challenge to it. And I think that that must be part of it. But we just tried to always stay true to, like, is it interesting, funny, heartfelt, exciting, beautiful to us? And if it is, then we've just got to believe that that's going to be true for other people.""

2023-06-30 14:00:00+00:00,Barbie: Impossible and Indiana Oppenheimer: July Box Office Needs a Hero,"Whether it's Tom Cruise, Margot Robbie, or Harrison Ford, July needs a box office hero.","July, the season of fireworks, vacations, and light-hearted blockbusters, represents this summer’s last shot at a $100 million opening. It will also determine if box office has a shot at improving on last year’s $3.4 billion total.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney) opens tomorrow, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) is July 12, and “Barbie” (Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” (Universal) are July 19. All are expected to open to at least $50 million; $100 million is not entirely unrealistic, but it may be unlikely. All told, the month could represent anywhere from $1 billion to as much as $1.4 billion.
Going in, the hope was a $4 billion summer — an 18 percent improvement above the 2022 total of just under $3.4 billion. So far, the improvement is 3.5 percent, on track for $3.5 billion. Even that isn’t guaranteed, although there’s hope that August will represent a significant improvement over a very weak 2022.
The June estimate is slightly over $1 billion, a four percent uptick from last year. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) contributed about a third of this, followed at some distance by “The Little Mermaid” (Disney) and “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” (Paramount), both of which grossed over $100 million in June. “The Flash” (WBD) and “Elemental” (Disney) will both reach $100 million, but their sluggish trajectories hurt the month’s performance.
“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd.
Opening-day grosses for “Indiana Jones” will go on the June ledger, with the bulk of its run in July. At this point, opening projections are no better than $70 million. That would be disappointing: Its production budget is $100 million more than “The Flash,” which opened to an underwhelming $55 million.
“Mission: Impossible” should be the month’s best performer as well as the best long-term bet. However, current tracking places its opening under $100 million. At this point, it may not challenge “Spider-Verse” for the summer’s #1 title; it’s headed toward $400 million domestic.
“Oppenheimer” will not open to $100 million and “Barbie” is a longshot, but they’re non-franchise titles without clear multi-quadrant appeal; it’s more important to consider their longer-term prospects.
Both have intense interest, although “Oppenheimer” could suffer from the same premium-screen syndrome that depressed initial grosses for “Avatar: The Way of Water” last December. Marketing emphasizes the superiority of the biggest-possible screens, particularly IMAX. That limits seating, as does three-hour running time.
“Barbie” has particularly strong female appeal, perhaps skewing a bit older. It’s unclear what it will offer other audiences, although its marketing promises that “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you… if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” (No word on what it does for those who don’t have strong feelings either way.)

The guess is “Barbie” will have the bigger opening that is more likely to top $50 million. Both films have budgets around $100 million, far below “Mission: Impossible” — yet another pegged around $300 million.
Other wide openings include “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” (Universal) tomorrow, “Insidious: The Red Door” (Sony) and “Joy Ride” (Lionsgate) July 7, then at the end of the month Disney’s “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s horror title “Talk to Me,” both July 28.
We figure the holdovers will add $225 million to the month’s total; all other new films, perhaps another $75 million. July last year took in $1.133 billion, the best month post-COVID. There’s a strong chance this July won’t improve on that, although the potential should be there for at least $1.2 billion. That would be only six percent over 2022 and raise the season to about five percent ahead.
It’s a tall order to hope that the top titles and other new releases will gross reach $900 million in July. It will take everything working at full tilt for this to happen.
With the prospects of production delays due to the WGA and potential SAG strikes, a summer release schedule that has fallen short, and general concern around the viability of comic-book movies, a lot is at stake. At this point, we know theaters are central to achieving all-platform success; what’s in question is whether the high expense of making and launching these titles makes financial sense.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2p1bHktYm94LW9mZmljZS1wcmV2aWV3LWJhcmJpZS1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWluZGlhbmEtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNDg3OTI2OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
02:34.6,'Barbie' vs. 'Oppenheimer': Who will win the box office battle?,,"It's a big week for Hollywood with the release of two blockbusters that have collectively become known as ""Barbenheimer"": “Barbie,” about the iconic Mattel doll; and “Oppenheimer,” about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man often called the father of the atomic bomb.
One makes the shiny, pink, plastic world of Barbie come to life; the other explores what led to the real-life tragedy unleashed by America’s use of the atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.
The two movies seem like opposites, at least on the surface. But are they?
“I think that it's exciting to have such a dissonant initial impression of the diametrically opposed theatrical experience,” Sarah G. Vincent, who writes about film for Cambridge Day, In Between Drafts and other outlets, told GBH’s Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel on Morning Edition Wednesday. “But I actually think when they go to the theaters, it's not going to feel like that.”
For the uninitiated: In April 2022, studios announced that director Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” would open the same day as director Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.”
Some of the social media-driven excitement was about the difference in aesthetics: Barbie’s glamorous, shiny and highly-saturated magenta world juxtaposed against Oppenheimer’s darker tones.

People started getting excited about which film would find more commercial success, Vincent said. Nolan has a history of dominating summer box offices with releases like his Batman movies and “Interstellar.”
“This seems like almost a no-brainer, he's going to win. Maybe the odds are in his favor,” Vincent said. “I've been rooting for Greta Gerwig, who's the underdog in this race. But I also think — and this is going to be an unpopular hot take — [Gerwig] is the better filmmaker, because her movies are actually really empathetic and on a human level.”
It’s hard to tell which film will come out on top, she said. Both have definite draws, albeit for different audiences.
But they also may have more in common than meets the eye, Vincent said.
“The movies may deal with similar thorny human issues, and 'Barbie' might be deeper than everyone's expecting. And maybe 'Oppenheimer' will be the lighter movie,” she said. “I don't know how it's going to play out in the actual theaters, but I do think 'Barbie' might surprise. The fan base may not be expecting what they get from Greta Gerwig.”
She emphasized that “Barbie” might be a bit darker than people are expecting.
“I have a feeling it's going to be parents with their kids, in for a bit of a surprise,” she said.
There are also the die-hard film fans embarking on what’s being called ""Barbenheimer"" movie days, seeing both movies, one after the other. GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel plans to be among them.
But in the battle of Barbenheimer opening weekend, most people will opt for a third choice: Staying home.
Movie theater attendance is just not what it once was. Some audience members are more comfortable at home, on their own couches with their own reasonably-priced popcorn, and no summer blockbuster will lure them back into a movie theater.
“I don't think this is what's going to tempt them to necessarily come outside,” Vincent said. “But for the people who are reliable Christopher Nolan fans and the people who like Barbie, they're going to come out.”
Further complicating the weekend box office is the fact that the star actors are on strike with the Screen Actors Guild, meaning they cannot promote their projects until major studios reach an agreement with the union.
Still, movie theaters have not had an opening weekend with this much buzz in a long time.
“When I went to 'Barbie,' I wore different shades of pink,” Vincent said. “And I don't usually do that. I'm usually kind of incognito in, like, the grayest, darkest thing. So that was a nice contrast. Maybe I'll continue it for the 'Oppenheimer' screening.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndnYmgub3JnL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy0wNy0xOS9iYXJiaWUtdnMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItd2hvLXdpbGwtd2luLXRoZS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJhdHRsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-31 11:20:53+00:00,"China Box Office: ‘Barbie’ Gains Foothold, Crosses $25M","After a soft start in China, 'Barbie' began to make inroads in the world's second-biggest movie market in its second weekend.","After a soft start in China, Barbie began to make inroads in the world’s second-biggest movie market in its second frame, buoyed by great critics scores and strong word of mouth.
Barbie opened to $8 million in China last weekend, claiming fifth place amid tough competition from local hits Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms, Chang An and Never Say Never. The modest total seemed to suggest that Barbie would go the way of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and a slew of recent Hollywood tentpoles that opened weak in China and failed to show legs — feeding into the trend that Chinese consumers were turning away from Western fare at the multiplex.
But unlike other recent Hollywood releases, Greta Gerwig’s had excellent scores on China’s most respected movie apps when it opened, earning 9.4 on Maoyan, 9.3 on Tao Piao Piao and 8.6 on Douban. This, along with strong word of mouth from audiences, has seen Chinese theaters increase the number of screens dedicated to the film, jumping from over 9,000 on release to around 36,000 screens according to Maoyan’s data.
The increased number of screens has already made an impact, with Barbie earning an impressive $7.3 million during its second weekend, a negligible week-over-week drop, with the film’s China total reaching $25.5 million, according to figures from regional box office data company Artisan Gateway.
And the coming weeks look brighter for Barbie, as the film has penetrated the discourse in China, something that Hollywood films rarely do these days. Chinese feminists are flocking to see Barbie and urging others to do so, as both an antidote to the usual male-orientated patriotic action movie that dominates the box office in the country and also for the themes found in the film. Notably, Barbie has sneaked past China’s notoriously stringent censors, despite the film tackling issues of feminism and toxic masculinity and featuring prominent LGBTQ+ characters.
Still, despite the good news, Barbie likely won’t make anywhere near the same impact at the China box office as it has in other markets around the world. Maoyan still projects that the film will top out at around $36 million for its China run
Elsewhere, historical fantasy epic Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms, the first film in the Fengshen Trilogy, won a second consecutive week, earning another $57.6 million, for a total cume of $155.5 million after two weeks on release. In second place was Da Peng’s comedy One and Only, which debuted to $36.2 million. Rounding out the top five were holdovers Chang An (in third place with $22.4 million) and Never Say Never (in fourth with $12 million).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJhcmJpZS0xMjM1NTQ3NzM4L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWJhcmJpZS0xMjM1NTQ3NzM4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 14:27:54+00:00,"Massive Box Office Weekend Sets Records For AMC Entertainment, Imax","AMC had its best weeked since 2019, Imax hit an all-time market share high.","AMC Entertainment set a new post-Covid record for global admissions revenue this past weekend with Barbie and Oppenheimer leading a charge that drew 7.8 million moviegoers to theaters.
Warner Bros/Mattel’s Barbie racked up $162 million opening weekend. Universal’s Oppenheimer stands at $82.4 million for a $300 million weekend at the domestic box office.
For Imax, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer delivered a $35 million debut on 740 screens worldwide, representing the biggest share ever of a film’s global opening weekend box office with 20% of total receipts.
AMC has the biggest number of Imax auditoriums among major chains.
AMC said Saturday was its busiest day since July of 2019. In the U.S., Friday, Saturday and Sunday each set single day post-reopening attendance records. On Saturday, AMC recorded the fifth highest single-day U.S. admissions ticket revenues in its 103-year history – and its second-highest highest food and beverage revenue day ever after Avengers: Endgame in May, 2019.
The “Barbenheimer” phenomenon was in evidence with 87,000 members of the AMC Stubs loyalty program booking tickets through Sunday evening to see both films.
“AMC sends an enormous thank you and congratulations to Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the entire team at Warner Bros., and to Christopher Nolan and the team at Universal Pictures. They’ve demonstrated that well-made, well-marketed films that captivate audiences can open on the same weekend and both enjoy great success,” said CEO Adam Aron.
Holdovers Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1 and Sound Of Freedom helped nudge the numbers into post-Covid attendance records.
AMC Entertainment has 950 theatres and 10,500 screens worldwide.
For Imax, Oppenheimer — shot with Imax cameras — repped its the biggest July opening weekend ever, global and domestic, the biggest opening weekend of 2023, and the biggest opening weekend ever for a Christopher Nolan film.
“Oppenheimer is an undeniable demonstration of a paradigm shift in moviegoing, with Imax taking a commanding share of global box office as audiences show a clear preference for experiences that transcend the ordinary in cinema,” said Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. “As he has done throughout his career, Christopher Nolan pushed the boundaries of IMAX technology to deliver unforgettable storytelling with ‘Oppenheimer’ and audiences are responding in numbers we’ve not seen in our 50-year history.”
In North America, the film opened to $21.1 million, an Imax-record of 26.2% of the domestic box office from 411 screens. Internationally, it opened to $13.9 million for 14.8% of the box office on 329 screens.
AMC shares were up 17% at $5.15. Its preferred APE units were down slightly at $1.78 after a court ruling Friday that wasn’t great news for the company longer term despite the current booming box office.
Imax is up 4% at $17.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLXNldHMtYW1jLWltYXgtYm94LW9mZmljZS1yZWNvcmRzLTEyMzU0NDYyNTMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItc2V0cy1hbWMtaW1heC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXJlY29yZHMtMTIzNTQ0NjI1My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-24 03:15:07+00:00,‘Mission: Impossible’ Box Office: Can ‘Dead Reckoning’ Rebound From Barbenheimer?,'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning' tumbled a series-worst 64 percent as 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' turned into weapons of box office mass destruction.,"Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.
His Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.
The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.
The question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.
“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.
Mission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.
Titles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.
Mission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
Cruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).
Adds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”
Estimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.
Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.
Things looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtZGVhZC1yZWNrb25pbmctYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiZW5oZWltZXItMTIzNTU0MzYwMi_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWRlYWQtcmVja29uaW5nLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmFyYmVuaGVpbWVyLTEyMzU1NDM2MDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-02 18:27:28+00:00,"Box Office Preview: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Aims for $35 Million Debut, ‘The Meg 2’ Swimming to $30 Million","""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is taking on ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" at the box office.","Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo are facing off against Barbie and Ken at the box office.
Paramount’s animated adventure “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is projected to pick up $35 million to $45 million in its first five days of release. But those ticket sales won’t be enough to dethrone “Barbie,” which is expected to top the box office for a third weekend in a row.
Greta Gerwig’s colorful fantasy comedy is eyeing $45 million to $50 million between Friday and Sunday, another huge result for the plastic fantastic blockbuster. It’s already the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $381.6 million in North America.
“TMNT” opens nationwide on Wednesday, two days ahead of another newcomer, the Warner Bros. shark sequel “Meg 2: The Trench.” Those films will vie for second place alongside Christopher Nolan’s historical drama “Oppenheimer,” now in its third weekend of release.
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” already collected $3.85 million from Tuesday’s preview screenings. The PG film cost $70 million, which is less than recent animated offerings such as Pixar’s $200 million-budgeted “Elemental” and Sony’s $100 million-budgeted “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Still, “Mutant Mayhem” needs to stick around in theaters beyond opening weekend to justify the production budget. With great reviews and positive word-of-mouth, the movie is hoping to benefit from kids who are out of school for summer vacation.
Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies seem to have faith in the film, since they are already developing a sequel, as well as a two-season Paramount+ series that will serve as a “bridge” between the big screen adventures.
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the creative team behind “Superbad,” wrote and produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” Jeff Rowe, the filmmaker of the Oscar-nominated “The Mitchells vs. the Machines,” directed the film, which follows the Turtle brothers, who set out to conquer the streets of New York City after spending years sheltered from the human world. The sprawling voice cast includes Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan and Ice Cube.
“Meg 2: The Trench” is targeting $25 million to $30 million in its debut. Those estimates are a significant drop from the first film, which opened to $45 million in the pre-pandemic era. “The Meg” became a surprise smash with $145 million in North America and $530.5 million globally. The follow-up film cost $130 million, so Warner Bros. is banking on another strong turnout at the international box office.
Ben Wheatley directed the sequel, which again stars Jason Statham and centers on a group of scientists who travel to the depths of the ocean and must fend off a 75-foot-long behemoth known as a megalodon — and other terrifying sea creatures.
“Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, looks to add $23 million to $26 million in its third outing. The film has earned $181 million at the domestic box office and $419 million at the global box office, a mammoth result for a three-hour biopic that’s heavy on dialogue and light on action. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, “Tenet” ($365 million) and “Batman Begins” ($373 million).",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWVzdGltYXRlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1Njg1OTMwL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JveC1vZmZpY2UtdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWVzdGltYXRlLWJhcmJpZS1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci0xMjM1Njg1OTMwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-19 20:54:06+00:00,Margot Robbie Told Studios in ‘Barbie’ Pitch Meetings That It Could ‘Make $1 Billion Dollars… Maybe I Was Overselling’,"Margot Robbie told studios that with the right director, the ""Barbie"" movie could be a one billion dollar grosser.","As a producer of “Barbie,” it was up to Margot Robbie to convince a studio that her vision for the film would lead to financial success. No wonder the Oscar nominee flat out said during pitch meetings that she believed a “Barbie” movie could bring in $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Such success depended on landing writer-director Greta Gerwig, Robbie stressed to execs.
“I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they’re brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director,” Robbie said in an interview with Collider. “And then I gave a series of examples like, ‘dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg’ – pretty much naming anything that’s been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years. And I was like, ‘And now you’ve got Barbie and Greta Gerwig.’ And I think I told them that it’d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?”
Whether “Barbie” makes $1 billion for Warner Bros. remains to be seen, but it’s already shaping up to be a blockbuster for the studio. The film is tracking for an opening weekend in the $95 million to $110 million range, with some exhibitors believing the comedy could make as much as $140 million in its debut. Warner Bros. is launching “Barbie” in 4,200 North American theaters over the weekend.
Gerwig signed on to direct “Barbie” and to co-write it with Noah Baumbach. The hire paid off for the film’s cast, especially Ryan Gosling.
“Greta, she’s just such a brilliant person and such an inclusive person,” Gosling told Collider. “She’s brilliant but incapable of being pretentious. I think what I admire so much about her work is that she doesn’t allow herself to create a divide between drama and comedy, and she encourages everyone around her to do the same. So you end up mining places that are in the in-between and it feels very specific to her, but also something that you can relate to because it’s more like life.”
“Barbie” opens nationwide on July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1iYXJiaWUtcGl0Y2gtbWVldGluZ3MtZmlsbS1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhcnMtMTIzNTY3NDM0My_SAWtodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL21hcmdvdC1yb2JiaWUtYmFyYmllLXBpdGNoLW1lZXRpbmdzLWZpbG0tYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXJzLTEyMzU2NzQzNDMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-06 14:24:31.302000+00:00,"Barbie, Bombs, Blockbusters! Box Office Wars Return as a Spectator Sport","This summer, Hollywood needs to make $4 billion from movies like 'Barbie,' 'Mission: Impossible,' and 'Oppenheimer' to be truly in the pink.","Tom Cruise knows how to sell tickets—even to other people’s movies. “This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” the Mission: Impossible star wrote on Instagram recently, while he and director Christopher McQuarrie posed with tickets in front of posters for rival films. Cruise congratulated Harrison Ford for “creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history” with Indiana Jones, and identified himself as one of the many people who’d make a double feature out of Oppenheimer and Barbie, which will go head-to-head in theaters as of July 21. His act of goodwill proved to be contagious, as he must have hoped it would. A few days later, Barbie director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie tweeted their own photo shoot, in which they also waved tickets to their rivals: “Mission: Accepted!”
Summer box office used to be the ultimate showbiz blood sport. Now, publicly at least, it’s all kumbaya and collegiality, which says a lot about the industry’s enduring post-pandemic fears. Beneath the gracious social media shoutouts is a pervasive sense that if the public doesn’t fall back in love with in-person moviegoing for good now, the bottom will continue to fall out of the studio system and take stars down in the process. So far, summer 2023 has proven to be a bumpy ride. Sure-things have struggled, surprise sleepers have failed to emerge, and pressure is mounting on a handful of July titles to save the season.
Box office watchers are still predicting that movies like Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One and Barbie can help summer ticket sales in the US and Canada hit $4 billion, which would be taken as a sign that the industry has indeed recovered from an anemic three years. But a trail of early underperformers—including DC’s The Flash, Pixar’s Elemental, and Indy’s fifth and final outing, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—has only stoked worries. With his cheerleading post, Cruise, the man who “saved Hollywood’s ass” last summer with Top Gun: Maverick, is attempting to stage a rescue mission again. This time he’ll have some help from Barbie and the atomic bomb.
Hollywood power brokers are watching all this closely, to say the least. “I was very excited after Super Mario Bros., and then I got a little more concerned after the last four weeks,” says producer Jason Blum, best known for low-cost horror hits Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and M3GAN. “The movie business has in no way bounced back like the live events business has, but I really think that it’s a matter of time.” Few expect earnings to surpass summer 2019 levels—when 32 films brought in $4.34 billion—but anything close will be a win. The industry is used to absorbing bad news—and hoping for last-minute salvation. “Not everything works,” says another studio executive poring over summer ticket sales, “but that’s just the movie business.”
There are reasons to be at least optimism-adjacent. Moviegoers still want to see spectacle—and they are willing to pay extra to see it on premium large-format screens. “2023 has definitely been a much fuller slate than pre-pandemic times,” says IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond. “And for us, it’s even a little more intense because the audience has shifted more to premium on a global basis. IMAX’s market share went up by 50% in North America and it’s gone up by about 40% globally. So it’s not only more competition within the industry, it’s more competition for IMAX screens. We think our box office will be similar to 2019.”
Similar is the new amazing.
Moviegoers signaled that they were ready to return to theaters last summer when they showed up in droves for Top Gun: Maverick, the top performer of the year with a staggering $719 million in US ticket sales, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which outperformed 2016’s Doctor Strange. But the robust performance of a handful of titles belied ongoing challenges. Last winter, as one Oscar contender after another died gasping at the box office, a senior awards strategist told Vanity Fair, “the audience is just not there anymore for these sorts of movies.” One obstacle was simply a volume problem: Even though tentpoles like Avatar: The Way of Water were dominating the weekend, there just weren’t enough movies in theaters.
This summer, every weekend offers multiple options, and they’re often aimed at disparate demographics, as with the showdown referred to in some quarters as “Barbenheimer.” Since May 5, when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 dropped, there’s been a steady beat of new releases, among them The Little Mermaid, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. The major studios are expected to release 42 films widely across the country by Labor Day weekend. One studio executive moans about all this in a way that sounds almost nostalgic: “It’s such a crowded summer.”
Before Cruise began his goodwill campaign, the actor was involved in a behind-the-scenes fight for IMAX screens, according to Puck. His latest Mission: Impossible outing will play on IMAX screens for about a week, but then must give them up for Oppenheimer, which debuts a week later on July 21 and has all the screens exclusively booked for three weeks. That has little to do with earnings expectations, and everything to do with relationships. Nolan, a longtime IMAX champion, had struck a deal long before with the exhibitor to guarantee that his movie would play on those screens, regardless of who else parachuted into the market on a motorcycle.
IMAX’s Gelfond tells VF that he worked closely with Nolan and Universal on Oppenheimer’s release date more than a year ago. He visited the Mission: Impossible set and is “a huge fan of Tom’s,” he says, but this is the bottom line: “We made a commitment to Chris. Obviously, I think the movie’s going to be great, but irrespective, we honor our commitments.”
Executives worried about a crowded schedule are one sign that movies are back, baby. “We’ve had really big films since reopening from the pandemic, like Avatar and Top Gun and Spider-Man, but now we’re talking about many titles,” says Elizabeth Frank, the executive in charge of programming AMC Entertainment’s more than 10,000 screens. “People are saying, ‘Well, which one do you want to see first?’ And that’s a different level of excitement. In an industry where momentum is really important, it’s an opportunity for us to build back habitual moviegoing.”
In Hollywood, the weekend box office is treated with the same seriousness as the World Series. “I have a group of friends, we get together at the beginning of the year and we have a draft, we pick all the movies for the year, and points are awarded based on Metacritic score, based on box office, based on awards, and based on profitability,” says Blum, whose company, Blumhouse, has Insidious: The Red Door out on July 7. “We text each other every Thursday or Friday. I’m currently in second place.”
Guys like Blum no doubt pay closer attention to movie ticket sales than the average American, but even he has noticed that more people are following the money as they did years ago. “The box office derby is one of those things that everyone can be a part of,” says Paul Dergarabedian, an entertainment industry analyst for Comscore. “Not everyone has played professional sports or ridden a horse professionally or driven a race car, but we can all sit in a movie theater.”
More scrutiny, of course, means more headlines when movies stumble. For every winner like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (with its $356 million in domestic grosses) or Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($346 million), there’s something like The Flash, which has pulled a meager $102 million in the US in spite of its reported $200 million budget, or Elemental, whose $29.6 million debut was considered a major flop for Disney’s Pixar. Meanwhile, Dial of Destiny, which reportedly cost $295 million, arguably needed to make a lot more over Fourth of July than it did. One bright spot? Studios are focusing more on profitability, which Blum contends, “everyone forgot about for about five years.” Now, he says, there’s more pressure to rein in costs: “The budget conversation was the last conversation when you were introducing new projects to buyers. Now it’s the first, which makes me happy because I think less expensive movies are often better and more interesting.”
Even before June gloom hit the box office, Hollywood had largely put its faith in Mission: Impossible, Barbie, and Oppenheimer to carry ticket sales. Now it’s even more imperative that all three titles find their audiences. Early tracking—which pegs the Mission: Impossible opening at around $90 million, Barbie somewhere north of $70 million, and Oppenheimer around $40 million—suggests that they will. Though Ethan Hunt will likely be the biggest star of the summer, media attention has focused squarely on the matchup between Barbie and Oppenheimer.
“I do think a rising tide lifts all boats,” says a top film agent. “When we have pictures in theaters that start to feel like they’re ‘watercooler’—which I really think the Barbie-Oppenheimer thing is becoming—it’s incredibly healthy for the box office, because what we’re doing is delivering an experience that people feel like was worth their time and money.”
AMC has been preparing for the summer movie season by extending operating hours at its theaters, hiring more staff, and making sure its Icee dispensers are full. “Increasingly, fans of different films are also looking for movie-themed merchandise and movie-themed drinks,” says Frank. “It makes the moviegoing experience that much more engaging and dynamic. It’s a little complicated, though, to be moving in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cups while you’re figuring out whether you’ve still got a bunch of people who want the Mission: Impossible ones or the Barbie ones.”
Predicting the box office has always been like reading tea leaves or tarot cards. Even IMAX’s Gelfond admits to fixating on the returns—from the first night to the last. “Like a junkie,” he says. “I hate to admit it, but yes. Most of our movies open on Thursday nights because they’re big blockbusters. So by Friday morning, I’m on the phone with our distribution and marketing teams trying to understand what the weekend’s going to look like and what’s working and not working and why and why not.”

,Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' Flick Stalls at Domestic Box Office,Tom Cruise's latest 'Mission: Impossible' is proving to be a bit more challenging than previously thought as far as box office.,"Tom Cruise is flying high in the new 'Mission: Impossible,' but the flick itself is already coming in for a mediocre landing at the box office ... at least that's the outlook.
The early ticket sale numbers are in, and with the pace it's currently at right now ... 'Dead Reckoning: Part One' is projected to rake in about $78 million domestically through its 5-day run. The movie got released early this past week, with full screenings starting Tuesday.
The problem with that figure, assuming it holds true through Sat/Sun, is that the early estimates had 'M:I 7' coming in at a way higher amount ... about $90 mil in North America.
While the early global box office numbers have helped boost 'Dead Reckoning' to a total projected opening of about $122 mil thus far ... the movie is still well below its reported budget of $290 million (for just Part 1, mind you). At this rate, it needs to have the kind of legs ""Top Gun: Maverick"" had to make its money back ... let alone turn a profit.
Meanwhile, ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" are waiting in the wings ... with both set to come out next week, and likely knocking 'M:I 7' down a few notches. ""Barbie,"" particularly, is expected to take the cake among the 3 films ... with a projected domestic opening of $93 million.
Considering all the marketing that's gone into ""Barbie,"" ya gotta figure their actual haul will be somewhat close to that number ... not to mention whatever ""Oppenheimer"" snags as well.
This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters.
Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history.

In any case, this appears to be bad news for Tom and co. ... again, only if these figures work out how they're expected to. Funny enough, Tom has been embracing all the summer blockbusters -- encouraging moviegoers to go see all the big flicks coming out, including his direct competition. He did this publicly amid reports that he was actually pissed BTS.
The irony, of course, is that Tom is a huge advocate of seeing movies in theaters ... and he's repeatedly gone on record as touting that as his ultimate goal as he continues his legacy.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtei5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xNS90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1tb3ZpZS1zdGFsbC1kb21lc3RpYy1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRtei5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xNS90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS1tb3ZpZS1zdGFsbC1kb21lc3RpYy1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-14 15:41:39+00:00,How Barbie Took Over the World,"Here’s everything you need to know about how the Barbie movie came to be and the frenzy around its opening, from the soundtrack to the merchandise to the fashion.","You’d be forgiven for thinking only one movie is coming out this year. It’s Barbie’s world, and we’re just living in it. Perhaps we should have anticipated the Barbie craze. After all, more than a billion dolls have been sold worldwide since Barbie’s debut in 1959.
Barbie is 64 years old, and yet this is the first time she’ll star in a live-action movie on the big screen. A Barbie movie has been in the works since at least 2009, but versions with stars like Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer stalled in part because Mattel was nervous about attaching a face and a personality to the doll. Barbie has no inner life on purpose; children are supposed to project their hopes and dreams onto her blank canvas.
Now, director Greta Gerwig is finally bringing not just one but several Barbies to the big screen—many of whom are featured on a recent cover of this magazine. Here’s everything you need to know about how the Barbie movie came to be and the frenzy around its opening, from the star-studded soundtrack to Margot Robbie’s red carpet looks to how the movie’s rivalry with Oppenheimer came to dominate social media. —Eliana Dockterman
What is Barbie about?
The marketing may be inescapable, but Warner Bros. has done a good job of keeping the plot of Barbie under wraps. We’ve seen the movie, and here’s what we can reveal: The film is set in Barbie Land, a utopia where each Barbie has an equally impressive job, ranging from diplomat to scientist to Supreme Court Justice. As Helen Mirren’s narrator wryly tells us, “all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.” The Barbies have sleepovers every night during which they declare how beautiful and confident they feel. The Kens exist as convenient dance partners. But then Margot Robbie’s Barbie begins to think about mortality. Looking for answers, she ventures into the real world with Ryan Gosling’s Ken, who has been feeling like a mere accessory in Barbie’s dream life. The real world is, well, real. Men in suits at Mattel—led by Will Ferrell’s CEO—make disingenuous speeches about female empowerment; tweens dress Barbie down for wreaking havoc on their self-esteem. Both Barbie and Ken go on quests of self-discovery, and that’s when things get really interesting.

The movie doesn’t stick to a single genre: Somehow Barbie is a satire of a toy company’s capitalist ambitions, a searing indictment of the current fraught state of gender relations, a heartwarming if occasionally clichéd tribute to girl power, and a musical spectacle filled with earworms from Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa. And then some. —Eliana Dockterman

Barbie merchandise and marketing
Along with a relentless press tour that has seen Barbies and Kens—or at least the actors playing them—grace the cover of seemingly every magazine (including ours), this summer has also played host to a blitz of Barbie merchandising. Warner Bros. and Mattel have partnered with everyone from Bloomingdales to Pinkberry to roll out pink products. The fashion and makeup collaborations were perhaps to be expected. But Barbie pasta? A Barbie XBox? Barbie and Ken popping up on the Bumble dating app? The scale of this marketing campaign may be unprecedented.
Mattel has engineered tie-ins that range from clothes to beauty to home decor Shoes: Aldo; Float: Funboy; Clip: Kitsch; Jacket: Gap; rug: Ruggable; Skates: Impala Skate
Still, the real reason that predictions for Barbie’s box office have nearly doubled in the last few weeks may have less to do with the fact that you can’t cross a street in a major city without spotting a Barbie ad and more to do with the fact that that ad is pink. Barbie is unapologetically leaning into the feminine aesthetic and courting a female audience—still a rarity in Hollywood. Big budget movies, including Barbie’s rivals at the box office, Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible, tend to be marketed toward a male audience.
But, as Gerwig told TIME in her interview for our cover story, the movie was always going to be at its heart a mother-daughter film. Just about every woman has played with Barbie at some point in her life and has an opinion on the doll, whether they love her or hate her. As the Barbie trailer says, “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” —Eliana Dockterman

The Greta Gerwig of it all
Fans of Gerwig were probably surprised when she signed on to Barbie. What was the writer-director of Lady Bird and Little Women doing filming what could easily turn into a Mattel commercial? But Gerwig told TIME that she was a huge fan of dolls as a kid—she was still playing with them in junior high: “Kids were drinking, and I was playing with dolls.” And she stuffed the film full of ideas—about capitalism, the patriarchy, religion, 1950s Hollywood musicals, and Sylvester Stallone’s sartorial choices, to name just a few.
Robbie, Ana Cruz Kayne, Gerwig, and Nef on the set that caused a global pink-paint shortage Jaap Buitendijk
The folks at Mattel have been notoriously protective of Barbie’s image over the years, and the head of Mattel Films, Robbie Brenner, told the toy company executives they would have to “white knuckle” it through the creative process as Gerwig and producer-star Robbie pushed the limits on how much they could poke fun of the iconic and controversial doll. That led to occasional clashes, including a moment when Mattel President Richard Dickson flew to London to argue with Gerwig and Robbie over a particular scene. Dickson told TIME they changed his mind by performing the scene for him. The resulting film is a mashup of something both uniquely Gerwig, filled with all her quirks, and a project of corporate ambition to sell more dolls. —Eliana Dockterman

The fashion
Though the marketing push surrounding Barbie has been groundbreaking, ubiquitous, and very, very pink, the most memorable part of the film’s promotionmay be the red carpet (ahem, pink carpet) looks sported by star Margot Robbie, who’s taken inspiration from iconic looks worn by the doll over the years. While it could have been easy for Robbie to simply rely on the ultra-pink Barbiecore trend for the film’s press tour, she and stylist Andrew Mukamal instead turned to the style archives of the world’s most famous doll.
From the signature black and white swimsuit and peep toe stiletto mules sported by the first Barbie doll in 1959 to the glamorous glittering black cocktail sheath with matching opera gloves worn by the “Solo in the Spotlight” doll that debuted in 1960, Robbie and Mukamal have found a way to not only channel, but also playfully reinterpret Barbie’s most iconic looks through high fashion collaborations with brands like Schiaparelli, Moschino, and Vivienne Westwood.

With her Barbie homages, Robbie isn’t just delivering exquisite looks or compelling marketing for Mattel—she’s also setting a new and incredibly high bar for what the future of the red carpet looks like. Here’s to a new (and far more playful) era of film promotion. —Cady Lang

The soundtrack
There’s been plenty of buzz around Barbie’s star-studded soundtrack. Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, and Karol G are just a few of the high-profile artists featured on the album, which is executive produced by the superproducer Mark Ronson.
In an interview, Mark Ronson describes what it was like making the album, finding the right collaborators, and jumping on the opportunity to work with Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. “Those two make some of my favorite films,” he says. “I thought, ‘Even if I don’t get this gig, I know this is going to be my favorite movie next year.’” So he signed on to do the project, and he and Gerwig hit the ground running: “I became the Robin to her Batman,” he says.
And after weeks of teasing, Ronson finally revealed that Billie Eilish—who the producer told TIME was “one of the f-cking greatest living artists around”—had contributed a song called “What Was I Made For?”—Moises Mendez II

The power of Ryan Gosling
The movie’s trailer makes the case that Barbie is everything and her male companion is “just Ken.” But it’s clear from the film’s press tour that Ryan Gosling is far more than just Barbie’s main squeeze. Throughout the film’s promotion, Gosling has been anything but plastic—delivering endless charm to journalists and fans alike by talking about how to channel your “Kenergy,” sporting numerous dapper pastel suits, extolling the virtues of director Greta Gerwig (and even wearing a shirt with her name on it), and praising his wife Eva Mendes and their two daughters. While he might not be the titular star of Barbie, Gosling has proven he’s a major player—and a joy and delight—when it comes to generating buzz around the film. —Cady Lang

Barbenheimer mania
What happens when two of the most anticipated films of 2023 debut in the same week? A fan-made movie crossover event known as Barbenheimer.
Barbie will be released on July 21, and so will Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s film about the development of the atomic bomb. Summer movie-goers are relishing the chance to celebrate a one-day cinematic experience of watching two polar-opposite films back-to-back. According to Elizabeth Frank, AMC’s CCO and executive VP of worldwide programming, over 20,000 tickets have been sold so far at AMC Theaters to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day.
The filmmakers and actors from both films are in on the fun, playfully leaning into the crowded film lineup to encourage more people to the movies. Gerwig and Robbie joined in, buying tickets to Oppenheimer, as well as the new Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones movies. Both Nolan and leading man Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer have addressed the frenzy, with Nolan telling IGN, “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.” —Mariah Espada

The geopolitical controversy

Barbie has landed in hot water in some parts of the world for a seemingly innocuous scene featuring a map that critics have alleged depicts the “nine-dash line”—a maritime border that, although rejected by an international tribunal at The Hague, has been used by China to assert ownership of practically all of the South China Sea.

Vietnam authorities banned the movie from being released in the country over the map, which Warner Bros. has said was meant simply to be a “whimsical, child-like crayon drawing” and was “not intended to make any type of statement.” The Philippines, another country that disputes China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, approved Barbie for release—justifying the decision in part by the fact that the line in question has only eight dashes—but requested the map scene be blurred to prevent further misinterpretation.

It’s not clear what exactly eight dashes jutting out the side of a misshapen Asia continent are supposed to represent, but it’s not the first time that this issue has caused controversy in the region, raising questions about the relationship between Hollywood and Beijing—and the extent some studios will go to appease China for access to its massive market.—Chad de Guzman

The movies that inspired Barbie

There are so many references and easter eggs in Barbie it would take multiple viewings to catch every one. The movie isn’t a musical, exactly, but it does have several song-and-dance numbers inspired by the soundstage musicals of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, particularly Gene Kelly films like An American in Paris and Singin’ in the Rain. But Gerwig also drew inspiration from much more contemporary films, and references to movies like The Matrix, Clueless, and even Zack Snyder’s cut of the Justice League find their way into the movie. And Gerwig didn’t stop at studying film. She also extended our interview for the Barbie cover story just to tell me that specific shots in the film were modeled on Michaelangelo’s Creation of Man, which adorns the Sistine Chapel. Like I said, there’s a lot going on in this movie. —Eliana Dockterman

The creator of Barbie

Before there was Barbie, girls mostly played with baby dolls designed to train them to be nurturing mothers. Barbie, dreamt up by Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler, was the first “fashion doll” who had the body and stature of an adult woman. Girls could project their future selves onto the doll rather than care for her. Eventually, they could dress her up to be a doctor, an astronaut, or even president of the United States. Handler named the doll after her daughter Barbara, a tidbit that led Greta Gerwig to ground Barbie in a mother-daughter story.

But Handler was a complicated woman who, as the Barbie film alludes to, was pursued by the IRS. In the movie she’s a god-like figure, even if a flawed one. —Eliana Dockterman

The Barbenheimer box office

Barbie outperformed even the most optimistic prognosticator’s predictions about the movie: The movie earned $337 million worldwide its opening weekend, the biggest debut of 2023 so far and the largest box office victory for a female director in the history of film.

Though it initially seemed like Barbie and Oppenheimer might cannibalize one another at the box office, it turns out that Barbie buoyed the World War II era biopic: According to a poll by The Quorum, 6% of people who saw Oppenheimer did so because Barbie was sold out. Together, they set a post-pandemic record at the box office. Not since Avengers: Endgame premiered in 2019 have so many people flocked to movie theaters. Studios are already scrambling to find lessons about how future films might coax audiences away from streaming services and back to the cinema.—Eliana Dockterman

A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom Westbrook

Barbie's box-office debut began in parts of Asia on Thursday and is expected to rake in $100 million from U.S. theatres over the weekend. Tickets and refreshed sales for Mattel's 60-year-old doll would be another testament to the consumer's resilience to rising interest rates and living costs.

But those pressures, however, are making themselves felt elsewhere.

Tesla shares were off 4% after hours when results showed price cuts squeezing margins and Chief Executive Elon Musk offered a typically frank assessment of the outlook.

""One day it seems like the world economy is falling apart, next day it's fine. I don't know what the hell is going on,"" he said. ""We're in, I would call it, turbulent times.""

Earnings season Down Under has had a negative early start with rubber-glove maker Ansell (ANN.AX) and hauler Aurizon warning this week on their respective outlooks.

U.S. jobless claims and housing sales headline an otherwise sparse data calendar later on Thursday. American Airlines (AAL.O) and Philip Morris (PM.N) are reporting.

In the Asia session, there were signs the cavalry is ambling to the rescue in China. Xinhua said guidelines from the Communist Party and cabinet contained pledges to support private business.

Traders were startled by an unexpectedly strong ""fix"" for the yuan's daily band, then turned firm buyers when the central bank also moved to encourage corporate fundraising abroad - a nudge for the yuan given the likely implications for capital flows.

Market sources told Reuters that China's state banks were out in the Asia morning selling dollars offshore.

Hong Kong stocks, which have been struggling since China's tepid second-quarter growth data landed on Monday, made an attempt to steady. A turnaround, however, might need more serious policy action from the Chinese government, particularly after a default at state-backed developer Greenland and fresh payment troubles elsewhere rekindled worries about the real estate sector.

The Aussie dollar surged 1% on a combination of a firmer yuan and better-than-expected jobs data that boosted market bets on further interest rate hikes.

Mattel says the Barbie movie is expected to boost global sales of Barbie dolls, which declined last year from record growth during the pandemic.

,Ben Shapiro's prediction of how Barbie would do at the box office has aged like milk,Ben Shapiro predicted that Barbie would be a box office flop but the film has instead passed the $1 billion mark,"History is full of predictions which were eventually to be proven enormously, ridiculously wrong.

Whether it's the 'unsinkable' Titanic, that the internet would just be a 'fad', or Einstein himself saying nuclear power was impossible, history is a cornucopia of big swings and misses.

And the latest among them has come from far-right commentator Ben Shapiro in his analysis of the new Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.

Shapiro made the rather bold prediction that the movie would be a box office flop, with no repeat business after its opening weekend.

He said: “My prediction: [Barbie] is just absolutely going to fall off a cliff after [week one]. The repeat business on this movie is going to be nonexistent.”

Wishful thinking perhaps?

Advert 10

Instead, Barbie has taken its anti-patriarchy message of showing the impossible social standards placed on women and being a role model for positive masculinity very far indeed.

The movie has just hit the $1 billion dollar mark at the box office.

Go woke, make a billion dollars I guess.

The run up to the movie saw a huge amount on-line attention as a viral marketing campaign saw random objects being painted pink, and the internet soon went Barbie mad.

In a twist of irony, one part of the online furore was Shapiro himself.

After being 'dragged' to see the film by his producers, he posted a video onto his YouTube channel entitled 'Ben Shapiro DESTROYS The Barbie Movie For 43 Minutes'.

Since being posted, the video has been viewed more than 2.5 million times on YouTube alone, as well as making a huge impression on Instagram and TikTok as people interacted with the video to also express their thoughts.

I'm no PR expert, but that looks like an awful lot of free advertising.

Now that Barbie has become the first movie with a solo female director to make $1 billion at the box office, the internet has been unable to resist dredging up Shapiro's prediction.

Another tweeted: ""It was clear from the first weekend that barbie was going to be huge. People were dressing up! It swamped Tom Cruise! You didn't have to be especially perspicacious to know it was going to do numbers.""

While a third simply said: ""Ouch.""

Shapiro has since released a response, tweeting: ""Totally true. I radically overestimated the taste of the American public. Guilty.""

He added: ""Serves me right for forgetting my Mencken - 'No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public'.""

2023-07-22 23:15:00.854000+00:00,Barbie boosts weekend ticket sales at local theaters,The new Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is projected to be a box office hit. Millions of fans across the nation are heading to local theaters in droves to see the popular plastic doll come to life on the silver screen.,"SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - The new Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is projected to be a box office hit. Millions of fans across the nation are heading to local theaters in droves to see the popular plastic doll come to life on the silver screen.

“I’m excited,” said Maeve Loring of South Hadley. “I used to watch all the Barbie movies when I was younger, so it’s cool having a new one come out.”

It’s opening weekend for the Barbie movie at the Tower Theaters in South Hadley.

Owner Robert Adam told Western Mass News that for the film’s opening night on Thursday, all showings for the Barbie movie in his theater were packed out.

“It was very busy last night. We had sold out shows for the evening. Thursday night was the premiere and that was also packed. So, for the first two nights, it has been amazing,” said Adam. “This and the Oppenheimer movie, which we don’t have, have been creating a sensation with the double feature stuff. People are finally coming back out, and these are the movies they’re deciding to come out to.”

The movie seems to be attracting crowds young and old. For the mother-daughter duo of Mary and Brianna Conchieri of Feeding Hills, Barbie has a sentimental value between them.

“She has got a Barbie every Christmas from the year she was born until now,” Mary said. “I won’t tell you how old she is now.”

“She was the best!” Brianna added. “I think she was the rock star Barbie or something, and she has the big crazy hair, so this is really fun.”

Based on the crowds piling into the theater’s seats, it’s a safe bet that Barbie fans in western Mass. can’t wait to see Margot Robbie’s Barbie world and give the world-renowned doll a new look and story on the silver screen.

“I think it’s cool to see it,” Loring said. "" I can’t wait to see what it’s actually about.”

“I’ve just always loved Barbies since I was small,” Brianna told us. “Now, they’ve made a big movie.”

“She had the dreamhouse and everything,” added Mary.

2023-07-30 14:50:09+00:00,"Box Office: ‘Haunted Mansion’ Spooked, ‘Barbie’ Scores Record $93M Second Weekend in U.S.","Barbenheimer isn't making life easy for 'Haunted Mansion,' while 'Barbie' soared to a record $93 million second weekend in North America.","Barbie really is a pink unicorn.

The movie earned an estimated $93 million in its sophomore outing at the North American box office — one of the best second weekends of all time and the best second weekend ever for Warner Bros., not adjusted for inflation.

The female-fueled Barbie, which continues to shatter any and all expectations, finished Sunday with a domestic cume of $351.4 million. Detractors had predicted it would fade away quickly after a history-making debut over the July 21-23 weekend, but that isn’t the case. The Greta Gerwig-directed film fell a scant 43 percent, a rare hold for a pic originally opening to such a big number at $162 million.

Barbie continued to paint the overseas box office pink as well. It dropped a mere 32.2 percent to $122.2 million this weekend for a foreign tally of $423.1 million and dreamy global total of $774.5 million through Sunday as it speeds toward the $1 billion mark. It will be only the second pic of 2023 so far to join the billion-dollar box office club after Universal’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which topped out at $1.34 billion worldwide.

The movie has even taken on a life of its own in China, where its cume hit $25 million through Sunday after a soft $8.2 million opening. It could leg out to $40 million, far more than anyone expected, considering Barbie isn’t doing as well in Asian markets as it is elsewhere. Among all international markets, the U.K. leads with $61.6 million, ahead of the final Harry Potter film’s first 10 days, while it is already the biggest Warners movie ever in Brazil with an early total of $33.5 million.

Other stats: Barbie enjoyed the biggest first week in Warner Bros. history at the box office, outpacing Christopher Nolan‘s The Dark Knight.

Not that Nolan needs to fret. His Universal movie Oppenheimer — the other half of the Barbenheimer effect — is also a box office force of nature that is holding up incredibly well in its sophomore outing. The three-hour biographical drama grossed an estimated $46.2 million this weekend, a mere 44 percent drop and the biggest second weekend ever for an R-rated summer pic ahead of Deadpool 2′s $43.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.

Oppenheimer finish the weekend with an estimated global haul of $400.4 million, including $174.6 million domestically and $226.3 million at the foreign box office, to rank as the filmmaker’s sixth-biggest film of all time ahead of Tenet and Batman Begins. Overseas, it is already Nolan’s biggest film ever in 28 markets and his biggest non-superhero title in 39. The weekend’s overseas tally was another $72.4 million.

Nolan’s movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atomic bomb, is a boon for Imax (Nolan used special Imax cameras). Oppenheimer is the second-fastest film to hit $80 million in global Imax ticket sales and, on Sunday, the large-format exhibitor announced it is extending the film’s run through the weekend of Aug. 11-13. That’s not the biggest surprise after Sony delayed the nationwide release of Gran Turismo by two weeks because of the SAG-AFTRA strike.

Elsewhere, Haunted Mansion was spooked in its debut in another big-budget summer miss for Disney. The live-action family pic opened to an estimated $24.2 million, one of the lowest starts ever among Disney’s live-action reimaginings of theme park attractions or classic animated films. Heading into the weekend, tracking suggested an already subdued $30 million launch.

In addition to going up against Barbenheimer, Haunted Mansion was also challenged by mediocre reviews and the struggling family marketplace. The star-packed cast was also unable to do publicity and press in the final two weeks before the film’s launch because of the actors strike, including staying away from the movie’s Disneyland premiere on July 15.

Disney is hopeful that good audience exit scores on PostTrak and a B+ CinemaScore will make up for any deficits and provide the film with long legs, just as Pixar’s summer film Elemental has enjoyed an enviable multiple after a soft start. The problem: both films were pricey to make, putting increased pressure on their box office performance. Haunted Mansion cost at least $150 million to produce before marketing. Elemental was $200 million.

Director Justin Simien’s Haunted Mansion, which turns Disneyland’s iconic attraction into a supernatural horror-comedy, stars Rosario Dawson, LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Chase W. Dillon, Daniel Levy, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jared Leto and Danny DeVito.

Overseas, Haunted Mansion grossed $9.1 million from 53 territories representing about 50 percent of the marketplace for a global bow of $33.3 million.

Angel Studios’ sleeper summer hit Sound of Freedom continued to hold at third place behind Barbie and Oppenheimer with another $12.4 million for a stunning domestic sum of $149 million, more than a slew of major studio summer tentpoles.

Paramount’s Tom Cruise tentpole Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, which is losing hope of rebounding from Barbenheimer, placed fifth ahead of A24’s new specialty horror film Talk to Me with $10.7 million for a domestic total of $139.2 million. MI7 continues to hold up better overseas, where it cleared the $300 million mark over the weekend after earning another $31.7 million. The pic’s global total through Sunday is $448.5 million.

From Australian twin brothers and filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou of RackaRacka YouTube channel fame, Talk to Me opened to a better-than-expected $10 million. The indie horror film, acquired out of Sundance, had been eyeing a $4 million to $5 million start. Its early performance is another win for A24, home of Oscar winner Everything Everywhere All at Once, although opening a specialty film nationwide and sustaining momentum is always a challenge.

2023-08-11 00:02:33+00:00,Why Did ‘Barbie’ Bomb in South Korea?,The Barbie movie struggled at the box office in Korea due to a lack of cultural nostalgia attached to Barbies and a local anti-feminist movement.,"While Greta Gerwig’s Barbie has taken the global box office by storm and shattered numerous records — the film raced past the $1 billion mark in just over two weeks — it hasn’t connected with audiences in one major market, South Korea. Some observers cite cultural differences as the reason — especially the film’s feminist messaging.

According to the Korean Film Council, Barbie only managed an eighth-place finish at the box office in Korea over the Aug. 4-6 weekend, grossing $273,414, with only a 1.2 percent advance ticket sales rate, compared to 35.8 percent for the other half of the “Barbenheimer” juggernaut — Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer — which is set for release in South Korea on Aug. 15.

Barbie has sold 518,172 tickets since its July 19 release, according to the KFC (for a total gross of $3.8 million according to Box Office Mojo). That compares to 3.8 million tickets for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which opened a week earlier.

Warner Bros. knew going in that Barbie would face challenges both in Korea and across Asia, which has underindexed as a region compared to other parts of the world. One intriguing development is China, where it opened to a forgettable $8.2 million but found its footing (sort of) after Chinese feminists flocked to see the film and urged others to do the same, saying it was an antidote to male-orientated patriotic action movies that rule the box office there. By the end of its third weekend, Barbie had climbed past $30 million in China, and Warner Bros. hopes this bodes well for Japan, where the pic opens Aug. 11.

But in Korea, a country where gender disparity and anti-feminist backlash are prevalent, the film’s focus — albeit uplifting — on female empowerment may have sparked discomfort and even fatigue.

“Given how gender has been politicized and became a polarizing issue in Korea in the past few years, young people seem to be easily exhausted by discussions around gender,” says Kang Yu-jeong, a professor of Cultural Contents at Kangnam University in the city of Yongin. “It’s such a sensitive topic for the younger generation — the film’s main target — that they want to avoid it entirely.”

Despite the country’s economic development and advanced technology, South Korea ranked 99th out of 146 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Global Gender Gap Report last year.

The country’s gender debate is so stark that during the 2022 presidential election, Yoon Suk-yeol, of the conservative People Power party, ran a winning campaign while pledging to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, claiming that the ministry promotes reverse discrimination against men. In a competitive job market, women’s economic advancement and mandatory military service for younger men have also fueled backlash against feminism in recent years.

“The parties widened the gender divide, targeting young men and women in their 20s,” Kang says.

Some suggest that the film may have suffered from the fact that its feminist undertones were not made clearer in its local marketing campaign. (For the most part, the global movie industry has lauded the Barbie campaign, saying it is one of the best sales efforts in modern times.)

“I think the film’s marketers have been too careful around the feminist subject,” Kang says. “So even the audiences who could have taken more interest in the film didn’t know what the film was about. It was really in the gray zone.”

On the film review site on Naver — the nation’s largest portal site — gender-specific reviews expressed surprise at the film’s feminist subtext. One user wrote: “If you’re a guy, skip this one, it’s uncomfortable and feels like an educational film.” Another added, “You don’t go to a movie to hear someone preaching.” Overall, male viewers gave the film a 5.99 score out of 10 while female viewers gave it a 9.27.

But marketing and gender issues aside, some see the film’s poor box office as being purely cultural, since Barbie is not seen as an iconic female figure in Korea.

“Star Wars didn’t do well in South Korea either because it’s not part of our culture,” says Moon So-Young, a Seoul-based journalist who has authored several books on culture and art. “We didn’t play with Barbie when we were growing up. We are familiar with Lego but not Barbie. Kids here these days don’t play with Barbie either. So there is no real fan base for Barbie in Korea.”

Min Yong-joon, a Seoul-based film critic and author, agrees, adding that the film’s culturally specific humor may not have translated either.

“The humor related to Ken dressed in western outfits dreaming of imaginary horses in the real world just did not translate here,” he says. “The film had a very particular American context. The kitsch references also didn’t seem to communicate well.”

In general, Korean movies with female leads tend to struggle at the box office, but there are exceptions. The market share of the Korean film Smugglers, which opened July 26 and tells the story of a group of women who become entangled in a smuggling scheme, has sold an impressive 3.5 million tickets.

“We didn’t weigh the risks of starring female leads, because the story is built around female sea divers and they were essential to the plot,” says Kang Hye-jung, the film’s producer. “I couldn’t understand why Hollywood went so wild about Barbie, perhaps because it has never been our [toy]. In general, people are so much more selective when they go to a movie nowadays. There is no such thing as a tentpole film anymore.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy93aHktYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLW5vdC1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhLTEyMzU1NTg2Mzkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL3doeS1iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbm90LXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtc291dGgta29yZWEtMTIzNTU1ODYzOS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

This weekend for all movies stands at an estimated $178M. This is the fourth time in box office history to have four movies cross $25M; the last time was Thanksgiving weekend 2018.

We always knew this weekend would beat the first frame of August a year ago ($92M), and that’s happening at +94%. But the current Friday-Sunday is also kicking the first weekend of August 2019’s $148.99M by +20%, and that’s when Hobbs & Shaw ruled the chart.

Barbie remains box office queen bee with $53M in weekend 3, after a $17M Friday and $20M Saturday. By EOD, Barbie is roughly $40M shy from passing the half billion mark at the domestic box office, with her gross set to stand at $459.4M. A $1 billion running global cume happens today!

That fierce battle for second place we saw yesterday between Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Oppenheimer, and The Meg 2: The Trench is settling down.

The second place winner is Meg 2 with $30M, an amazing one-two punch for the weekend by Warner Bros. No one was expecting Meg 2 to rank in second place. Here’s the takeaway with Meg 2 this weekend: For all those studios clutching their pearls and worried about stars not doing press and looking to dynamite the rest of the 2023 calendar. Meg 2‘s opening was achieved off a screening program campaign, with in-theater and online trailers and TV spots. I hear that Jason Statham and the cast didn’t do that much press here in the U.S. Such is the plus of opening a sequel off the gas of its established IP. The first Meg‘s campy comedic marketing campaign five years ago already did the heavy lifting in establishing the brand. The sequel’s trailers just needed to run with it.

Beamed Jeff Goldstein, Domestic Distribution President of Warner Bros, “This is an extraordinary time for Barbie fans, as the blowout parties continue. Meg 2 delivered the one-two punch and scared audiences everywhere.”

Uni’s Oppenheimer is third with $28.7M. Since opening, per EntTelligene, Barbenheimer, has pulled in 55.5M moviegoers. Broken out, that’s 39M for Barbie and another 16.5M for Oppenheimer.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, after a great Saturday of $10.3M, +11% over Friday’s $9.3M, is coming in at $28M over 3-days and $43M, which is still great for this $70M production.

Wow, that was easy. Everyone played nice. Typically, when there’s a tie in an upper ranking, especially No. 1, it’s a game of chicken among the majors on Sunday morning when calling it. More specifically, there’s a delay in reporting, with snarking all around. One of the more notorious fights over first in recent memory was the weekend of Sept. 29-Oct. 1, 2017 when the opening of Tom Cruise’s American Made, the fourth weekend of It, and the second weekend of Kingsman: The Golden Circle were all ranking in the high $16M range. Kingsman won with $16.935M.

Turtles is a huge win for the Brian Robbins Paramount administration, particularly as he builds out and revives franchises.

Said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s domestic distribution boss, “We’re over the moon with this opening. We exceeded pre-release expectations with this movie, which has been a labor of love for a long time.”

The decision to revive Turtles happened back in 2018, when Robbins was at Nickelodeon with Ramsey Naito, current president, Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation, and they sparked to the idea of Seth Rogen’s involvement, as well as filmmaker Jeff Rowe — both lifelong fans — who truly wanted to lean into the ‘teenage’ part of the IP. Paramount, like all their movies this year, has gotten behind promoting the animated pic 200%, having Rogen show off extended footage at CineamCon, and a work-in-progress cut at Annecy back in June. Props to Paramount: They were the only studio who realized that there would be a full-house crowd down at San Diego Comic-Con: fans unfazed by the strikes. So they took Turtles down to Hall H and showed off more footage to fans with Rowe in tow, as well as TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman — the latter who just stoked the crowd. Why skip an opportunity? Very smart on the Melrose lot for being fearless and creative sans stars in their promotion. Rival studios, take note.

The second animated take of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak audience score of 88% positive and a 70% recommend, with kids under 12 giving it 94%, and a 69% must-see. That’s enough ooze to keep chugging into the fall. That’s on top of the pic’s already “A” CinemaScore. Men showing up at 60% to women’s 40%, with 56% of the crowd between 18-34. The biggest demo is 18-24 at 34%. Diversity demos are 33% Caucasian, a great 33% Latino and Hispanic, 17% Black, and 16% Asian/other. The South Central and the West are the most robust here for the Nickelodeon/Point Grey production. Oppenheimer still has Imax, but the Turtles have PLFs, which are driving 16% of ticket sales and another 11% from 3D. Adam Aron’s AMC Burbank is the top-grossing movie theater in the nation at $103K-plus so far. Cowabunga.

TMNT:MM saw Canada delivering 5% of the gross with major markets that over-indexed being L.A., Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Austin, while the only major markets that under-indexed were Seattle and Toronto. Top theaters came from L.A., N.Y., Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, Pharr, Texas, El Paso, Nashville, San Antonio, and Houston.

Social media analytics corp RelishMix says that Turtles’ social media universe is 309.8M across Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok combined. Ahead of release, RelishMix said those stats were under family animated averages. But clearly there’s an appetite here for the movie, as it’s greatly over-performing.

PostTrak audiences gave Meg 2 72% in the top two boxes, with a 55% recommend, and a B- to the first chapter’s B+. South Central and South are the biggest-grossing regions. Note, there’s a lot of walk-up business here, like there was on the first movie, from the Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, who are showing up at 25% to Caucasian 41%, Black 15%, and Asian American at 13%. Warners does have some PLFs for the shark that are shared with the Turtles, accounting for 22.5% of the overall gross with another 18% coming from 3D screens. The Regal Fresno Riverpark is leading the pack with $39K in gross (including early shows) so far.

RelishMix counts a social media universe for the sequel of 350.8M, 14% above genre averages next to action-adventure sci-fi titles, with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on the high end at 611.3M SMU. “Chatter flows positive on The Meg 2, which makes new waves as the audacious, over-the-top shark sequel being hailed as a high-octane escape into ‘stupid-crazy-fun entertainment’ with endless positive snarky threads. The return of Jason Statham draws a splash as fans gush, ‘Looks amazing, especially with Jason Statham in this epic shark movie.'” reports RelishMix.

Jason Statham, who counts 111M fans on social media, got this modest plug in for the film on Instagram before the SAG-AFTRA strikes began:

Warner Bros

FRIDAY MIDDAY: The third weekend of Warner Bros’ Barbie at $51M (-45%) is higher than the opening of the Brad Pitt action movie, Bullet Train, which did $30M during the first weekend of August. It just goes to show how far we’ve come along at the box office. The Greta Gerwig directed take on the Mattel doll is eyeing a third Friday of $16M at 4,178 theaters, -45% from a week ago. Running total by Sunday will be $457.4M.

Universal’s Oppenheimer will hold on to third place at 3,612 theaters with a $7.8M third Friday (-42%), and third weekend of $27M, -42%, sending its running total by Sunday to $226.8M. Pic is director Christopher Nolan’s fourth highest domestic besting Batman Begins and Dunkirk. It’s also the highest grossing R-rated film of 2023 domestically ahead of John Wick Chapter 4 ($187.1M). Oppenheimer also reps the fastest Universal R-rated release to cross $200M in U.S./Canada, taking 15 days. Previous R-rated $200M Uni champ was 2012’s Ted, which took 37 days to that benchmark.

Third at 3,858 theaters is Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with a first Friday of $8.5M, 3-day of $27M, and 5-day of $42M, well ahead of its $30M-$40M expectations. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is 94% to go along with that A CinemaScore.

Warner Bros‘ The Meg 2: The Trench at 3,503 theaters is a seeing an $11M Friday, including previews, and a $25M opening — robust for the marketplace. Audiences are so-so on it so far at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s better than the 43% the first movie notched with RT crowds.

Disney’s second weekend of The Haunted Mansion at 3,740 is seeing a second estimated Friday of $2.8M,-72%, second weekend of $9.5M, -60%, for a running total of $42.5M.

FRIDAY AM: Barbie Crosses $400M, Oppenheimer Nears $200M, Turtles 2-day $15M, Meg 2 Previews $3M+ The spoils of July are spilling over into August as Warner Bros.’ Barbie, after a $11.8M Thursday, jetted across the four-century mark at the domestic box office in her 14th day –faster than Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie– with a running total of $406.4M at 4,337 locations.

She’s poised to make around $55M in her third weekend, with Oppenheimer ringing in at least another $23M+; all of this spelling for a 3-day box office marketplace that will be exceedingly well north of last year’s $92M for the first weekend of August. The Christopher Nolan-directed movie earned $5.58M yesterday at 3,647 theaters taking its two-week total to $199.86M.

Warner Bros. also has some lagniappe at the weekend box office with The Meg 2: The Trench which is expected to do between $20M-$30M. Last night from previews that began at 3PM, the shark sequel did $3.2M at 3,400 locations. That’s a pretty good result for a sequel that stars a shark: The first Jason Statham movie brought in $4M in previews before churning out a $16.6M Friday, and $45.4M opening off what was a very campy, satirical marketing campaign. The $129M costing Meg 2 has a 50% stake from China’s CMC. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes loathe the sequel at 28% worse than the first movie back in 2018 at 45%. It’s a popcorn film for the masses, not for the tweeds.

Meanwhile, Paramount/Nickelodeon/Point Grey’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem saw its 2-day box office rise to $15M. Thursday was $4.87M at 3,513, -52% from Wednesday, with the Jeff Rowe-directed animated movie ranking third for the day.

Disney’s Haunted Mansion ranked fourth on Thursday with an estimated $1.6M at 3,740, -10% from Wednesday for a first week take of $33M. The previous Eddie Murphy 2003 movie opened on a Wednesday over Thanksgiving and its first seven days grossed $35.4M (unadjusted for inflation).

Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom booked at 3,411, did $1.47M yesterday, -6%, for a running four week total of $156.4M.

A24’s horror movie Talk to Me at 2,340 theaters did an estimated $1.2M yesterday for a first week of $15.8M. Granted, this title went wide versus A24’s Bodies Bodies Bodies last summer, which platformed, but it’s great to note that this Sundance acquisition has outstripped that Pete Davidson horror comedy’s total stateside cume of $11.4M. Talk to Me‘s first seven days are also 22% ahead of Midsommar‘s which stood at $13M and finaled at $27.4M.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYm94LW9mZmljZS1iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbWVnLTItdGVlbmFnZS1tdXRhbnQtbmluamEtdHVydGxlcy0xMjM1NDU0ODYwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-11 09:51:07+00:00,'Barbie' movie opens in Japan after atomic bomb controversy,"Hollywood blockbuster ""Barbie"" hit theatres in Japan on Friday, where ""Barbenheimer"" memes linking the doll-themed film with the atomic bomb caused a stir and made distributor Warner Bros apologise ahead of the release.","TOKYO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Hollywood blockbuster ""Barbie"" hit theatres in Japan on Friday, where ""Barbenheimer"" memes linking the doll-themed film with the atomic bomb caused a stir and made distributor Warner Bros (WBD.O) apologise ahead of the release.

Tickets for ""Barbie"", starring Margot Robbie in the title role, nevertheless sold fast in Japan as fans flocked to the theatrical release, timed to coincide with a national holiday marking the first day of Japan's extended summer holiday week.

""The pink world of Barbie was absolutely beautiful,"" said Misaki Suzuki, 29-year-old nail salon worker, after watching the film at a Tokyo cinema.

""Barbie"" has topped $1 billion in global box office since its July 21 debut, making writer and director Greta Gerwig the first female filmmaker to surpass that benchmark as a solo director. The success of the fantasy-comedy was further boosted by the coupling with ""Oppenheimer"", the biopic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb during World War Two that opened on the same weekend.

But the ""Barbenheimer"" combo sparked a backlash in Japan, as the nation earlier this month marked the memorials of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 78 years ago.

In now-deleted posts on platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Warner Bros' ""Barbie"" marketing account had latched on to fan-produced memes that depicted Robbie with ""Oppenheimer"" actor Cillian Murphy alongside images of nuclear blasts.

A Change.org petition was launched on Aug 1, demanding that Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind ""Oppenheimer"", call a halt to the #Barbenheimer hashtag on social media. It has collected about 22,600 signatures to date.

A #NoBarbenheimer hashtag trended in Japan at the time, prompting Warner's Japan division to issue a rare public criticism of its U.S. parent company, which then followed with an apology last week.

Mitsuki Takahata, who voiced Barbie in the dubbed Japanese version, said in an Aug 2 Instagram post that she was dismayed upon learning of the memes. ""This incident is really, really disappointing,"" she posted.

Still, Japanese fans of the movie, which sends Mattel Inc's (MAT.O) iconic doll into real life, said the controversy did not discourage them from visiting theatres.

""It was harsh"", said 24-year-old university student Rie Takeda, commenting on the fan-produced #Barbenheimer memes.

""But the movie was radiant, beyond that I had fun"" watching it, she said.

No Japan release date has been announced for ""Oppenheimer"", which has been criticised for largely ignoring the atomic bomb's destruction of two major Japanese cities in 1945, accounting for more than 200,000 deaths.

,Randall Park Says 'Barbie' Success Should Mean 'More Movies By and About Women' — Not Toys,Randall Park says the 'industry is taking the wrong lessons' from the box office success of 'Barbie' by commissioning more toy-based film projects,"Hollywood is jumping on the toy-based movie train after the success of Barbie — but Randall Park thinks that is the wrong takeaway.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, the actor, who directed the new film Shortcomings, touched on how he believes the ""industry is taking the wrong lessons"" from Barbie's popularity.

""Barbie is this massive blockbuster, and the idea is: Make more movies about toys! No — make more movies by and about women!"" said Park, 49, adding later, ""It’s Greta Gerwig!""

Park also reflected on the success of 2018's Crazy Rich Asians as a turning point, saying he was ""very conscious and in support of the importance of"" that film. ""It felt like the beginning of something,"" he said.

""Of a shift in culture for Asian Americans, and I think it really spoke to the massive success of that movie. It wasn’t just Asians watching that movie — it was so many different people,"" he said.

""From my perspective, in this industry we had been told time and again that our stories wouldn’t connect with Middle America,"" Park added. ""They won’t understand it and won’t be able to identify with our stories. It proved that these stories are universal, ultimately, and for everybody.""

Featuring an extensive star-studded cast led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Barbie has passed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales, making Gerwig, 40, the first female director to hit this box-office milestone as a solo director.

Barbie became Warner Bros. Pictures' biggest-selling film for a Monday ever following its $155 million domestic opening weekend, and the industry's biggest opening weekend for a movie directed by a woman.

The movie's success has led Mattel, the Barbie-owning toy company, to plan to adapt 14 additional Mattel properties — including a Polly Pocket movie, directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins — for the big screen.

Other Mattel film projects with notable directors, producers or actors attached include a Major Matt Mason movie starring Tom Hanks, a Hot Wheels film produced by J.J. Abrams, and a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots film with Vin Diesel.

Both Gerwig and Robbie have touched on the idea of more potential Barbie movies in the future, with the director telling PEOPLE for a Barbie special edition that she hopes hers ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.""

""There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,"" added Gerwig. ""I want to go back to Barbie Land.""

As for Robbie, who also produced Barbie, the Oscar nominee said during a cover interview with TIME magazine published in June, ""I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels.""

Still, she has been part of conversations about what the future holds for Barbie in terms of a cinematic experience to follow the first film. ""It could go a million different directions from this point,"" she said.

2023-07-31 04:54:53+00:00,China Box Office: ‘Creation of the Gods’ Solidifies Lead With $57 Million Second Weekend as ‘Barbie’ Shows Its Legs,"'Creation of the Gods’ solidifies its lead at the China box office, but ‘Barbie’ shows that it is not to be underestimated.","

“Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,” the first part of Wuershan’s big-budget “Fengshen Trilogy,” topped the mainland China box office for the second weekend and expanded its week-on-week haul by 35%.



‘Barbie’ also showed signs of resilience in a market where it opened a week earlier in a disappointing fifth place.



“Creation of the Gods I” grossed $57.6 million. according to data from consultancy firm Artisan Gateway. That compares with $42.6 million in it opening frame and after 11 days in Chinese theaters, it has earned $156 million. Also, unlike its first weekend, “Creation of the Gods” was the winner on each day between Friday and Sunday.



The “Fengshen Trilogy” set out to be a mega scale blending of history, folklore and mythology from more than 3,000 years ago, that would be China’s answer to both “Lord of the Rings” and “Iron Man.” It counts of Barrie Osborne (“Lord of the Rings”) as production consultant and Bill Kong (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”) among its executive producers.



The strong hold meant that it was a good distance ahead of “One and Only,” a youth which was the highest-ranked new release with a somewhat disappointing $36.2 million debut.



A youth comedy set in the street-dance milieu, directed by Da Peng, “One and Only” stars comedian Huang Bo and rising star Wang Yibo as well as a large supporting cast. Including revenues from its earlier previews, the film has $53.8 million in the bank.



Imax reported that “Creation of the Gods I”earned $5.5 million of its weekend total on its screens, reaching an Imax cumulative of $18.5 million, or some 12% of its China cumulative, from fewer than 1% of the country’s screens. “One and Only” also took $1.6 million on Imax screens in China.



The weekend’s surprise package was “Barbie.” The film remained in fifth place on its second weekend of release in China, with $7.3 million. But its week-on-week decline was a modest 11% compared with an opening of $8.2 million. After 10 days on release it has amassed $25.5 million.



While the film’s initial disappointment may have been explained by Chinese audiences’ relative unfamiliarity with the Barbie doll and muted infatuation with American pop culture, discussion of the movie has nevertheless become a hot topic.



“Barbie” has ignited discussion of feminism and female gender roles in a Chinese society that remains male-dominated and been a trending topic on social media for several days. “Barbie” also represents something of an antidote to Chinese cinema’s diet of patriotic (and frequently patriarchal) movie output.



Third place over the weekend belonged to “Chang An” (aka “Chang An 30,000 Miles”), a Chinese animation which is in its fourth weekend of release, which grossed $22.4 million over the latest weekend . After 23 days on release it has already accumulated $213 million, making it one of the top-scoring Chinese-produced animation titles of all time.



Fourth place belonged to “Never Say Never,” written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (“Lost in Thailand,” “Detective Chinatown”), with $12 million in its fourth weekend. Its cumulative now stands at $287 million after 25 days on release.



Artisan Gateway reports that total weekend box office was worth $147 million. That lifts the running total for 2023 to $4.90 billion, which the consultancy firm calculates is only 6% below the same point in pre-pandemic 2019.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1jcmVhdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtZ29kcy1iYXJiaWUtMTIzNTY4MzE1Mi_SAV9odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtY3JlYXRpb24tb2YtdGhlLWdvZHMtYmFyYmllLTEyMzU2ODMxNTIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

""Barbie's"" big Box Office debut could give retailers a boost, at least, according to our next guest. Roth MKM says the buzz around the film could drive traffic to stores like Five Below in particular. Citing previous successes from blockbusters like ""Frozen.""

The analyst behind the call is David Bellinger and he joins me now. David, good to see you here. So from an investor perspective here, how should people be approaching Five Below in relation to the success that we might see with the ""Barbie"" movie?

DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah. thanks for having me on. So Five Below historically has been one of these companies that's drafted off new intellectual property very well. We saw some precedent with this, you mentioned ""Frozen."" We had ""The Super Mario Brothers"" released over the Easter weekend that was much better than expected from a domestic Box Office standpoint.

And Five gets ahead of these trends. They fill their stores with a number of items. We're in the stores a lot. We've come across 30 plus licensed ""Barbie"" items, while that's not material, just given that Five Below sells thousands of products within their store.

It could generate enough buzz via social media and other means to get people in the store. They really discover the Five Below brands. They shop other categories and they come back. So we've seen that historically too with things like fidget spinners and other crazes. And that's what really unleashes the power of the Five Below model and gets them a nice new customer base that continues to spend Well

Story continues

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, would this be the best time to get in then to Five Below versus, sort of, obviously, the movie is coming out shortly or isn't it best to sort of wait and see as we have like more blockbusters also coming out this summer?

DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, there's clearly a new slate of movies that's come out that we haven't had over the past few years. There's a ""Paw Patrol"" movie coming out as well. But look, I like Five Below. This is a long-term growth story. Some of these smaller catalysts, they're not a huge deal for their stock but they could help out in some type of way.

And we'll be keeping a close eye on this ""Barbie"" release and the Box Office numbers as they come in. I think it could be a nice positive. But if you step back and just look at the growth potential of this model going from 1,200 to 3,500 plus stores, this company is on a real nice trajectory to get to somewhere of five billion plus in sales.

And you could easily see earnings power go from between $5 and $6 per share this year, upwards of $10. And that's what I think gets investors really bullish on this name. And it's not just a single quarter or two. This is a nice long-term trajectory here.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And who would you say would be the main competition for Five Below when it comes to some of these licensed products from the ""Barbie"" movie and some of these other big franchises?

DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, it's an interesting question. So your big retailers, your Amazons, Walmarts, Targets, they sell a lot of this product. But there's no one out there that's really the last true comparable for Five.

You have Toys R US go away. And they're really one of the last kid's retailers within the US. And they get ahead of these trends and that's what's really helped them. They've been able to garner much more product, much more inventory, they've got a great relationship with their suppliers, and they want to be part of this long-term growth algorithm, right?

They know Fives coming out with big new store growth numbers. They want to invest behind that. Get their inventory in these stores. So Fives really leading the category up. It alone, really, in terms of themselves. But they do pry away from some share from these bigger players and their low-price points are a clear way of doing that.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And you raise a good point. I mean, I have a 9-year-old. I'll be lucky if I can leave Five Below just spending $5. Because as you mentioned, once you get them in the door-- where you used to have a Toys R US everywhere, now there's Five Below and you sort of have multiple things you can spend on there.

Talk about five below expansion plans when it comes to, especially, sort of, children's retail or some of these more trendy-- some of these trends that they're able to capitalize on in a way that some of these other stores can't.

DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, I've got a four-and-a-half-year-old daughter and I'm in the stores a lot as well, spending a lot of money too. So I think what they really do well is-- these relationships with suppliers, they pick off trends early.

And in my checks, I've seen hot items like collectibles, Pokemon cards, sports trading cards, I mentioned those fidget spinners a few years ago, and it really creates this halo effect around the business. And Five has sort of become the HomeSense for kids. It's this treasure hunt, got a nice discovery piece to it, and like you mentioned, you're not just buying one item.

You might build your basket and spend anywhere from $15, $20 to $30. And then, just not knowing what you're going to find that treasure-hunt field, that's what keeps you coming back. And Five has garnered a lot of new customers.

And I think they're driving a lot more of their organic traffic now. They're driving their traffic more organically as opposed to drafting off other adjacent retailers. So that's really what's in their DNA and I expect that to continue for years to come.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as we've seen, though, as people have been tightening their purse strings. Not all value plays are created equal here. So are there any risks that you see for Five Below that people should be aware of?

DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, I mean, just a broader spending pullback, right? There's partially a lower-income consumer that could shop these stores. So that's a potential risk factor. You also have a little limited visibility on these movie releases, right?

You don't know if ""Barbie's"" going to be a hit or not so that could create some volatility. But overall, in my sense, I feel as though consumers have been trading down somewhat, right? You might not buy that $30, $40, toy. You might buy a $5 to $10 item.

And Five has this great value flavor to the business. They've expanded into these Five Beyond products, a new concept in their store. I've seen items upwards of $25. But even though, that might be a higher price point.

Those have continued to sell well because-- just the value differential versus what you might find at a Amazon, Target or Walmart, there are a lot of also exclusive products that Five sells and they've really tapped into that core customer. And they've held on to them really-- exceptionally well.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, there you go. I'm sure consumers will be saying goodbye to their money, but at least some good news for investors here when it comes to Five Below. A big thank you there to David Bellinger, Roth MKM consumer growth and e-commerce senior analyst. Thank you for your time this morning.

DAVID BELLINGER: Thank you.

2023-08-01 14:33:50+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ Juggernaut Continues U.K. Box Office Domination After Second Weekend of Release,'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' continued their domination of the U.K. box office with a combined $27.3 million after their second weekend.,"Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” and Universal’s “Oppenheimer” continued their domination of the U.K. and Ireland box office with a combined £21.4 million ($27.3 million) after their second weekend, per numbers from Comscore.

Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” topped the charts for the second week in a row with £13.2 million, and now has a total of £47.9 million. The film is expected to surpass Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which is the year’s current No. 1 film in the territory with £54.4 million, this week.

Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” was second with £8.2 million and now has a total of £27.6 million. It is currently the fifth highest grossing film of the year and is expected to move beyond “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (£30 million) into fourth place this week.

In its third weekend, Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” earned £1.8 million in third place for a total of £20.2 million. Disney’s “Elemental” collected £1.1 million in fourth position in its fourth weekend for a total of £11.8 million.

Rounding off the top five was Altitude’s “Talk to Me,” which debuted with a strong £643,547, a record for the distributor in the territory.

From Bollywood, Moviegoers Entertainment’s “Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,” by star filmmaker Karan Johar, with a cast awash in A-listers including Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan and Shabana Azmi, bowed in seventh position with £370,882.

Compared to recent films starring Singh or Bhatt, the film is performing better, surpassing the first week (seven-day) collections of “Gully Boy” (£366,000) “Gangubai Kathiawadi” (£345,000) “Sooryavanshi” (£334,000) “’83” (£321,000) and “Dil Dhadakne Do” (£312,000).

“Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” collected £80,000 on Monday, meaning an 80% hold.

The other debut in the top 10 was also from India. Dreamz Ent’s “Bro,” starring Pawan Kalyan and Sai Dharam Tej, bowed in 10th place with 107,494.

This upcoming weekend, new releases will include ocean predator sequel “Meg 2: The Trench” and family-friendly animation “Just Super,” which Warner Bros. and Signature Entertainment are respectively opening across more than 300 locations each.

Picturehouse Entertainment is releasing Cannes and Toronto title “Paris Memories,” which won lead Virginie Efira best actress at France’s Cesar Awards.

2023-06-26 15:29:18+00:00,"Blockbuster Pileup: Can ‘Oppenheimer,’ ‘Barbie,’ ‘Indiana Jones 5’ and ‘Mission: Impossible 7’ All Survive in the Same Month?",Can several back-to-back blockbusters succeed at once? Or will the glut of big movies cannibalize each other?,"At the end of last summer, Flix Brewhouse faced a dire situation, albeit one that wasn’t unique to the Texas-based movie theater chain. There weren’t any movies to show in August.

“We were going to A24 or Briarcliff Entertainment saying, ‘Does anyone have anything we can put on our screens?” recalls Chris Randleman, the company’s chief revenue officer.

That’s not the case this summer as exhibitors grapple with a different reality. Can several back-to-back blockbusters succeed at once? Or will the glut of big movies cannibalize each other?

Those are the big questions as popcorn season kicks into high gear with the arrivals of Harrison Ford’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (June 30), Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” (July 12), Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated “Barbie” (July 21) and Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer” (also on July 21). All of those films carry big budgets and require outsized ticket sales to turn a profit.

“It’s complete day and night,” Randleman says. “In the last two years, if something failed, we didn’t have anything for six weeks. Now if something tanks, you move onto the next one. That’s the way Hollywood always worked.”

The hope is that all of these films will find their audiences. However, Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at Comscore, calls the month-long stretch between “Indiana Jones 5” through “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” one of the most competitive periods in recent memory.

“This will be a stress test for the theatrical marketplace in the most important moviegoing season of the year,” he says. “The stakes are incredibly high.”

So far, Hollywood’s attempts this year at counter-programming have been disastrous. But that’s because audiences didn’t have an overwhelming desire to watch “The Flash” or Pixar’s “Elemental,” not because those movies were scheduled too close together.

Even as the box office recovers in fits and starts, there are signs that even in the pandemic era, several films can work at the same time. A prime example can be found in last summer’s debut of “Jurassic World Dominion,” which scored a mighty $145 million opening, even as Cruise’s enduring hit “Top Gun: Maverick” pulled in $51.8 million in its third weekend. Another weekend in the middle of 2022, four movies — Baz Luhrmann’s biopic “Elvis” and Blumhouse’s thriller “The Black Phone,” in addition to “Maverick” and “Jurassic World Dominion” — each grossed $20 million or more in the same Friday to Sunday frame. It’s a sign that this summer’s crop of newcomers can co-exist beyond their opening weekends — so long as ticket buyers care to see them.

“It’s all about quality,” says Armand Daiguillon, who owns Paradigm Cinemas in South Florida. “Everything looks good on the horizon. But if the movies aren’t great, people will wait a month until they are available on streaming.”

Movie theater owners believe the range of offerings will appeal to moviegoers of all demographics. “It’s the right mix of movies to not only survive but thrive off one another,” says Randleman. He’s particularly high on “Barbie” because pre-sale tickets at his theaters have already been surging. “I think it’ll be the true breakout of the summer,” he adds. “Everyone can survive. We have enough screens.”

Daiguillon of Paradigm Cinema, however, is cautiously optimistic about a potential pileup. “It would have been better if they separated things a little more,” he says. “We have a whole summer. These movies are all back-to-back in the same month.”

He’s particularly concerned about the space between family offerings, like “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which opens shortly after Pixar’s “Elemental,” and Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” which arrives just a few weeks later.

“I wish there was at least another week between the kids stuff,” Daiguillon says. “Theaters do a lot of business with summer camps. If all the movies come out at once, there’s nothing for them to see later on.”

At least, Hollywood didn’t forget about August, which is ripe for a sleeper hit. On the calendar, there’s the animated “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” R-rated comedy “Strays” and “Meg 2: The Trench.” Those movies aren’t (yet) part of franchises as big as “Mission: Impossible” or from filmmakers as beloved as Gerwig or Nolan. But “The Trench,” for one, is the sequel to 2018’s disaster epic “The Meg,” which grossed $530 million worldwide. Says Randleman, “Never bet against a shark movie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvanVseS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy0xMjM1NjU0MTAwL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL2JveC1vZmZpY2UvanVseS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLWJhcmJpZS1taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtNy0xMjM1NjU0MTAwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

In the wake of AMC reporting that north of 40K of their Stubs members have purchased tickets for both movies in the same day, NATO/National Association of Theatre Owners is saying that more than 200K moviegoers will attend same-day viewings of Barbie and Oppenheimer at theaters across North America.

“According to our estimates, we project that more than 200,000 moviegoers in North America will be enjoying an exciting same-day double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer, in addition to the millions of worldwide moviegoers who are planning to see both films on different days this weekend,” says Michael O’Leary, President and CEO of NATO. “Movies have once again confirmed their power to capture our cultural imagination, with the cinema proving to be the ultimate place to go to be part of a shared experience.

As summer rolls to a close, this weekend will be one of the quietest we’ve had for some time, with the market leaning mostly on the strength of holdover business while Universal debuts The Last Voyage of the Demeter.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter

Universal Pictures

August 11, 2023 (WIDE)

Opening Weekend Range: $6M-$11M

PROS and CONS:

Barbie will extend its reign to four weekends atop the domestic box office as it comes off a $53 million third frame. The $1 billion-dollar global earner will also look to cross the $500 million domestic barrier before this weekend’s end as it chases the $574.2 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie, currently the top grosser of 2023.

After last weekend’s brief reprieve from the number two spot—Meg 2‘s debut pushed it down to third place—Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer should reclaim second place as it continues to display the kind of holding power typical of the filmmaker’s past releases. Even before its fourth frame is up, the pic is set to become the fourth of Nolan’s career to cross $250 million domestically after The Dark Knight, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem should begin settling into a leggy haul, with strong reviews (96 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (92 percent) carrying the franchise revival to a long family-driven runway.

Meg 2: The Trench currently boasts a 72 percent audience score, which would be a concern for most films… but not so much here, as the first Meg owns a far lower 43 percent. The sequel faces minimal competition from the weekend’s new opener and should continue to benefit from double-header screenings with Barbie at various drive-in locations.

Meanwhile, The Last Voyage of the Demeter may be fighting for a debut in the top five this weekend. Pre-sale trends are comparable to last August’s Beast and The Invitation. Tracking is strongest among men under 35, while its R rating and period setting offset other benefits offered by the Dracula-inspired narrative and appeal to horror fans.

Current projection ranges call for a 30% to 35% decrease from last weekend’s $172.9 million top ten aggregate.

Interestingly, both movies are scheduled to release on the same day, July 21, adding to the excitement surrounding their release.

Renowned writer-director Paul Schrader expressed his fervent praise for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Comparing it to his own iconic works like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and The Last Temptation of Christ, Schrader described Oppenheimer as the “most important film of this century"". He enthusiastically encouraged audiences to make it a priority to watch Oppenheimer in theatres.

“If you see one film in cinemas this year it should be Oppenheimer,"" he wrote.

Meanwhile, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is expected to outshine Christopher Nolan's atomic-bomb drama in the box office race, providing a substantial boost to ticket sales.

Barbie features A-list actors Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and is set to make an impressive $110-million debut at the US box office. While Warner Bros, the distributor of Barbie, is being more cautious with their estimates, eyeing a $75-million start in the US, industry analysts are optimistic, with some predicting it could even reach as high as $140 million.

The film is poised to break the current record for the highest-opening film in the US made by a female director, which is currently held by Wonder Woman with a $103-million debut.

Oppenheimer’s disadvantage

On the other hand, Christopher Nolan-directed biopic, starring Cillian Murphy as the renowned scientist, is projected to open to $50 million in the US, with a worldwide figure of at least $100 million.

However, the film's release is facing stiff competition from Barbie, as it will be shown in 600 fewer cinemas than its toy-themed rival and has a longer runtime, allowing for fewer showings. Barbie will grace 4,200 cinemas in the US.

The ""Barbie"" movie brought in $155 million in ticket sales during its opening weekend, breaking the record for first-weekend success for a film directed by a woman, according to AP News. However, Bettina Dorfmann has been breaking records with Barbies since she won the Guinness World Record for the biggest Barbie collection in 2005 – a title she still holds today.

When Dorfmann, 62, first broke the record, she had 2,500 Barbies to her name. Her collection grew to 15,000 Barbies by 2011, and today she has 18,500 in her haul, according to various news reports.

Dorfmann has been collecting since she received her first Barbie in 1966, and her collection includes an original Barbie from when Mattel launched the doll in 1959. That Barbie sold at auction in 2006 for $27,450, so while there's no official tally to Dorfmann's collection, it's likely worth millions.

(As someone who collected Barbies as a kid—before my father gave them away when I went off to college—you can imagine my disappointment when I saw my Celebration 2000 Barbie going for $11,000 on eBay.)

Dorfmann told i News that collecting Barbies is a great way to see how the world has changed, ""including women's careers from the 50s to today.""

She has already bought the new movie-related Barbies for her collection, of course, including the new Margot Robbie Barbie that's currently sold out at big retailers (but can be found on eBay for $144.99).

Dorfmann has been able to make a living off her collection by lending her dolls for exhibits, writing books, and offering doll repairs in her ""doll hospital,"" according to Guinness.

,'Sound of Freedom' Has Now Made More Money in U.S. Than Latest 'Indiana Jones' and 'Mission: Impossible',"'Sound of Freedom' director Alejandro Monteverde admitted that ""no one thought that this movie was going to make the box office it’s making; it’s a complete surprise, including to myself'","Sound of Freedom, despite mixed reactions and controversies, has now earned more at the domestic box office than big-budget sequels in the Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible franchises.

The movie has so far made $174 million in the U.S. since its July 4 release, according to Deadline. That's more than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's $172.9 million (released June 30) and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s $160.8 million (released July 12).

Worldwide, Harrison Ford's Dial of Destiny has earned over $375 million, while Tom Cruise's Dead Reckoning Part One has passed $522 million. Sound of Freedom is set to rollout internationally in different territories over the next few months.

For comparison, Variety reported that Sound of Freedom's budget was about $14.5 million, whereas Dead Reckoning and Dial of Destiny cost closer to $300 million each, before an estimated $100 million for marketing.

Sound of Freedom is loosely based on a true story about a man helping rescue children from a human trafficking operation in Colombia. Its star, Passion of the Christ actor Jim Caviezel, has caused controversy for promoting QAnon conspiracy theories while promoting the film on far-right platforms.

Writer/director Alejandro Monteverde has spoken out about the ""heartbreaking"" backlash, saying his views differ from the actor's standpoints.

Disney, which released Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones sequel, at one point owned Sound of Freedom when it purchased Fox back in 2019.

Eventually, though, its producers ""raised a little bit of money and bought the film back,"" Monteverde told Variety. ""Then we were thinking, ‘Okay, let’s go out [and shop it].’ Then COVID. Boom. People were always telling you even before they saw the film, ‘Right now, people want to see uplifting films.' ""

""Then, the Harmon brothers [who founded Angel Studios] came in, and they just had a completely different way of marketing a film that I’ve never seen.""

Angel Studios crowd-funded money for its marketing budget, which it says has now been paid back to those who contributed. It also included an unusual box office tactic: A video with Caviezel at the end of the credits encourages moviegoers to pay it forward by buying more tickets to the movie.

Director Monteverde indicated that he wasn't fully on board with that campaign at first.

""They told me, ‘We’re going to put a video at the end of where Jim will talk. I was like, ‘Arghhhhh.’ I became a pain. And they told me, ‘Alejandro, let us do our work. You have to trust us.’ And we made a deal,"" he said, claiming that the pay-it-forward method added ""under 10 percent"" to its overall box office haul.

About the post-credit pay-it-forward video, he added to the Los Angeles Times, ""Now, if you ask me, 'Alejandro, if it was your [move], would you have that?' I will say no. But that’s why I’m not a distributor. If I was a distributor, I’d surely collapse the company because I’d be all about the art. So I respect and admire the work that Angel Studios does, because it’s not an easy movie to market.""

Questioned about not having fans donate to an organization working against human-trafficking and instead more movie tickets, the filmmaker argued ""awareness [brought by the movie] creates change more than sending $20 to one [organization].""

Monteverde, who started the project in 2015, admitted he didn't think Sound of Freedom was going to be released. Now, he says it has become a ""phenomenon.""

""Nobody, no one, thought that this movie was going to make the box office it’s making. It’s a complete surprise, including to myself,"" he told the LA Times. ""I thought this movie was never going to see the light of day. So I ended up giving away my points. I’m not going to make $1.""

He said the near-$200-million box office performance means Sound of Freedom has transcended to ""become a bipartisan film."" Monteverde added that how the movie does in other markets will truly demonstrate the film's appeal.

""We’re going to see what happens when [it’s released] internationally, because the politics are here. If internationally, we come back with a big price tag, then you can’t deny that,"" he said. ""These same conspiracy theories do not exist in Mexico, Argentina, France, Italy. I’m going to Colombia for the premiere, so I can’t wait to see what’s going to happen. I want to keep it humble. But I’m feeling excited.""

2023-07-28 20:46:47+00:00,‘Barbie’ And ‘Oppenheimer’ Propel UK & Ireland Box Office To Biggest Week Ever,"Barbenheimer has fuelled a new UK box office milestone, propelling sales to £66.4M over one week.","EXCLUSIVE: The UK box office is booming thanks to Barbenheimer.

According to seven-day figures from Comscore, this past week is the highest ever recorded at the UK and Ireland box office, with £66,373,575 clocked from all movies between July 21-27.

The feat has been fueled by the Barbenheimer phenomenon, which has seen Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer catch the public’s attention like few film combos ever before. Both opened last weekend.

To achieve the milestone, this past week has overtaken the frame December 18-24, 2015 when ticket stubs totaled £58,618,154 thanks in large part to Star Wars pic The Force Awakens.

Barbie picked up an estimated £18.5M and Oppenheimer clocked £10.9M over opening weekend, the first time two films had opened to more than £10M each in the UK.

Mission Impossible was the third best performer over the past seven days and took £2.8M over last weekend but the vast majority of the week’s total UK box office came from Barbenheimer.

The stellar return was helped by the popularity of larger format presentations such as IMAX, which attract a higher price point than regular screenings.

Unconfirmed figures from UK cinema advertising organization Digital Cinema Media also suggest admissions for this past week were at a 10-year high, with cinemas on track to clock north of seven million admissions.

The previous record of 7.6M admissions was set in 2012 during the first-week of Sam Mendes’ Bond pic Skyfall. We can expect firm figures on admissions in the coming weeks.

The UK box office has been all Barbenheimer all week, with exhibitors reporting record highs. On Sunday Vue Cinemas said the two films helped the chain to its second-biggest weekend in history as moviegoers flocked in record numbers to catch the double bill. Vue said more than a fifth of all customers at its cinemas booked tickets to see both films. The chain also recorded over 2,000 sold-out sessions of Barbie.

Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Barbie has clocked a thumping $528.6M globally through Wednesday, including $291.4M from international, and that’s after only one week of release. The film is now the biggest Warner Bros. offshore opening ever for a non-franchise film. The pic is also the largest-ever opening weekend for an original, non-franchise film at the UK & Ireland market box office.

At the same time, Christopher Nolan’s explosive biopic Oppenheimer has a strong global total of $265.1M through Wednesday. The offshore figure is $147.2M.

Both titles are performing beyond expectations and have been buoyed by strong responses from critics and audiences alike.

Both films also clocked records stateside, with Barbie recording the largest domestic opening of the 2023 year, besting Super Mario Bros.‘s $146.4 3-day weekend. The film is also Warner Bros.’s largest advance sales haul ever at $49.5M.

(WLUC) - Two box office hits have arrived in theaters in Upper Michigan. You may have heard of this phenomenon sweeping our country.

Moviegoers are already filing in to see the package of both movies in Quinnesec, known online as “Barbenheimer.” The “Barbie” movie starring Margot Robbie hits box offices the same weekend as the historical World War II film, “Oppenheimer.”

Thomas Theatre Group staff said in the Quinnesec theatre alone, more than 200 people visited the theatre for mid-day showings of both films.

“Honestly, it is going to be neck and neck, but I think ‘Barbie’ will edge ‘Oppenheimer ‘slightly,” said Jennifer Alwine, Quinnesec Thomas Theatre Group General Manager. “This is because you will get more kids and families. ‘Oppenheimer’ will be a fantastic film too. It will be hard to say, but I think ‘Barbie’ will edge it out just a little bit.”

Staff said they expect Saturday to be extremely busy and they recommend you purchase tickets ahead of time. Next Thursday, the theatre will run a special promotion for “Barbie.” It will offer $5 tickets and $5 combos for girls night.

2023-07-27 17:12:37+00:00,‘Barbenheimer’ is stimulating the economy,“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have been such blockbuster movies that their impact appears to be showing up in economic statistics.,"New York CNN Business —

“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have been such blockbuster movies that their impact appears to be showing up in economic statistics.

Bank of America cardholders increased their non-gasoline spending by 1.9% year over year during the week ending July 22, the bank said Thursday.

While spending in many categories fell — including online electronics, home improvement, furniture and lodging — one area is surging: entertainment.

Bank of America cardholders spent 13.2% more on entertainment than a year ago, easily the most out of any category tracked. That is a significant acceleration from the week of July 15, when entertainment spending was up 4.9%.

Earlier in July, entertainment spending was flat to down compared with the year before, according to Bank of America.

In a research report, Bank of America said the increase in spending on entertainment, as well as at clothing stores, was “likely partially driven by the release of the much-anticipated movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer.”

“Barbie” dominated the box office in its debut weekend, raking in $162 million at the domestic box office. The film, distributed by CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, was the biggest-ever debut for a female director.

Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” brought in another $82.5 million.

The blockbuster results show how consumers are still spending aggressively in some areas — even as they pull back on goods and elsewhere.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was even asked on Wednesday about how demand for “Barbie” and Taylor Swift concerts is impacting the broader economy.

Powell said the “overall resilience” of the economy, coupled with cooling inflation and rebounding consumer confidence, is a “good thing.”

However, the Fed chair acknowledged that if the economy heats up too much, it could prove problematic for the central bank.

“At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy,” Powell said. “So we’ll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNy9idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJiaWUtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItbW92aWVzLWVjb25vbXkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDcvMjcvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyYmllLW9wcGVuaGVpbWVyLW1vdmllcy1lY29ub215L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 14:54:13+00:00,Ken's Journey in Barbie Is a Story About Male Fragility,"Along with Don't Worry Darling and Promising Young Woman, Barbie asks what to do with the modern man who feels emasculated by women's power.","This story contains spoilers for Barbie

Who knew that “He’s just Ken” was more than a marketing joke? The Barbie movie centers, of course, on its titular character played by Margot Robbie. But Ken (Ryan Gosling) plays an important role in the drama as he wrangles with the notion that he’s long been an accessory in Barbie’s dream life more than an equal partner. I’ll say the quiet part out loud: Even though this is a movie that leans heavily into a feminine aesthetic and is, as writer-director Greta Gerwig told me during an interview for TIME’s Barbie cover story, a film at its core for mothers and daughters, Ken has the most intriguing and funniest part to play, offering a searing social commentary on modern man’s insecurities dressed up in bubble-gum pink.

More from TIME

Perhaps we shouldn’t have expected less from the mind behind Lady Bird and Little Women. Gerwig transforms a joke about the forgettable male doll into a meditation on the state of masculinity at a moment when so many young men, feeling disempowered, have found misguided solace in the patriarchy. It’s a B-plot that’s so compelling it often outshines the somewhat dated girl-power mantras of Barbie’s A-plot.

Ken’s awakening

From the start of the film, Ken smarts at Barbie’s small rejections. He seethes when she talks to other Kens, particularly the one played by Simu Liu, whom he sees as a rival. He doesn’t have a real job or home or purpose outside of Barbie. Then Ken leaves Barbieland, a feminist utopia, and enters the real world, where men run, well, everything. In short, Ken discovers the patriarchy and decides to bring it back to Barbieland, establishing his own “Kendom.”

In a clever bit of screenwriting, Ken cares more about the sartorial manifestations of the patriarchy than the patriarchy itself. He is, after all, a fashion doll. When he discovers that demolishing feminism involves more than donning Sylvester Stallone-inspired fur coats, riding horses, and redecorating Barbie’s Dreamhouse into what he dubs his Mojo Dojo Casa House, he loses interest. He’s easily distracted by acting out war games with the other Kens, allowing the Barbies take back Barbieland from the boys.

By the end of the movie, Barbie and Ken have to have a serious conversation about their relationship. Barbie makes it clear she’s not interested in Ken romantically and urges him to find his own personal passions. The finale not only flips the normal script on female-centric films—in which a woman discovers she doesn’t need a man to find her inner power (Legally Blonde, Eat Pray Love, etc.)—but offers a commentary on how men ought to reassess their own desires outside of their need to both control and depend on women.

A story that will resonate with men

Ken (Gosling) would like more attention from Barbie (Robbie) Courtesy of Warner Bros.

During interviews for the cover story on Barbie in this magazine, producer David Heyman suggested that men of all ages would find resonance with Ken’s journey. “I think Ryan is undeniable and so affecting in the film. People really care for Ken even when he’s misguided,” he says. “I think a lot of boys and men will find there’s a lot to relate to in Ken as they try to find their place in the world. But it’s all done with such a light touch and such generosity, and Ryan is just, I think, extraordinary.”

Gosling does, indeed, pull off what could have bene a tricky character. If Ken weren’t so ridiculous, he’d be threatening. Ken isn’t an incel exactly. Short for “involuntary celibate,” incel is a term that certain men use for themselves to describe a state where they feel rejected by women, and resentful toward them as a result. These men spend a lot of time on internet forums bashing feminists and longing for the days when women didn’t work, men controlled women’s bodies, and men’s mere earning power could all but “guarantee” them a sexual partner or wife. These online misogynist groups are a breeding ground for toxic language that has also spilled over into real-world violence.

Ken is more mild-mannered than that. He doesn’t have the, um, parts down there to even really understand what sex is. When he tries to kiss Barbie goodnight, she stares at him blankly. When he asks to stay over, she asks innocently what they would do. He charmingly replies that he doesn’t know. But the implication is certainly that Ken would really prefer if he had more of Barbie’s attention: He can never stay over because Barbie tells him “every night is girls’ night,” and while the Barbies live in the dream houses, the Kens don’t seem to have their own homes. (Maybe they live on the beach and that’s why Ken’s job is, nonsensically, “Beach.”)

Read More: We’re Ignoring the Real Reason Barbie Might Dominate the Box Office

When Ken enters the real world, people suddenly call him “sir” and ask for his advice or help. While men on Venice Beach ogle Barbie, they treat Ken with a certain degree of respect. Ken is enthralled by this newfound power. Unfortunately, he learns that he can’t just walk his way into a job as a banker or doctor. He complains to one man in a business suit that his company must not be “doing patriarchy right” if a man without any qualifications can’t get a job. The businessman assures him that they are doing patriarchy correctly, they just need to hide it better than they used to. So Ken eventually decides that if he cannot participate in the patriarchy in the real world, he’ll bring the philosophy back to Barbieland, transforming it into the Kendom.

When Ken quickly falls under the sway of the patriarchy and returns to Barbieland to preach its gospel, one can’t help but think of certain male rights activists recruiting impressionable young followers.

Male fragility onscreen, beyond Ken

Florence Pugh and Harry Styles in Don't Worry Darling Merrick Morton—Warner Bros.

Gerwig isn’t the first director to wrestle with this problem in recent years. Watching Barbie, I couldn’t help but think of last year’s Olivia Wilde movie Don’t Worry Darling. These films seemingly have nothing to do with one another. One’s a musical romp, the other a sci-fi inspired psychodrama.

But the third-act twist of Don’t Worry Darling—major spoilers ahead for this fraught film—is that Florence Pugh’s character isn’t actually living in a 1950s suburban utopia. She’s trapped in a simulation by her partner (Harry Styles). Feeling emasculated by his wife’s taxing job as a doctor and his own unemployment, Styles’ character listens to a men’s rights podcast and falls under the influence of its host, played by Chris Pine. Wilde says Pine’s character was inspired by Jordan Peterson, whom she describes as a “hero to the incel community.” The hypnotic podcast host convinces Styles that both he and Pugh would be happier living in a fantasy throwback to an era where the men worked and the women played housewife. Pugh eventually figures out the trick and comes into violent confrontation with her captor.

Other shows and films have explored similar territory: The excellent 2017 Black Mirror episode USS Callister reveals over the course of its runtime that a talented but oft-mocked coder (Jesse Plemons) has stolen the DNA of the people in his life he resents (mostly women of color) and forced them into a simulation where he plays the captain of a Star Trek-like ship.

Emerald Fennell (who makes a cameo in Barbie) explored the simmering violence lurking beneath the surface of self-styled “nice guys” in her 2020 thriller Promising Young Woman, even casting actors who cultivated those reputations in other projects like Adam Brody (The O.C.) and Max Greenfield (New Girl) to drive home the point to the audience.

All of these films draw at least some inspiration from the original Stepford Wives book (and its various film and television adaptations). The satirical feminist horror story chronicles a husband’s conspiracy to subjugate his working wife after they move to a community filled with strangely robotic women who live to serve their spouses.

The fantasy of finding equilibrium

Ken (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Ken (Gosling), and Ken (Ncuti Gatwa) Courtesy of Warner Bros.

Ryan Gosling’s portrayal of Ken in Barbie is lighter and funnier than these more serious takes on the resentful man who works to repress the women around him. Heyman is right that we empathize with Ken when he’s ignored by Barbie and root for him to find his meaning.

But at its root, his energy—or “kenergy”—is not dissimilar from the men in these other stories. His feelings of emasculation manifest in shows of aggressive behavior, albeit satirical ones. Like Styles in Don’t Worry Darling, he seems not just resentful but without a purpose in a world where women pursue their passions. Both movies are deeply interested in the idea that modern men feel uncomfortable ceding power to women and what it means for their identities.

What, in the end, are women to do about this male fragility? Barbie offers a complicated and not entirely satisfying answer. The Barbies eventually overthrow the Kendom and reach a detente with the Kens. They will give the Kens as much power in Barbieland as women have in the real world. Just a few judgeships, not half of them. And cabinet positions, but not the presidency.

It’s not exactly equality, but it’s a compromise. Whether such an equilibrium can or should be reached in the real world the film doesn’t try to answer. Nor is it necessarily the responsibility of a fun musical romp to do so. In the end, Ken, specifically, learns that he’s “Kenough” without Barbie, a resolution that plays better as a pun than an edict for the modern man.

2023-08-20 19:09:00+00:00,"‘Oppenheimer’ Rises To $718M Global, ‘Barbie’ Basks In $1.28B, ‘Meg 2’ Chomps Past $300M; ‘Blue Beetle’ Scurries To $18M Overseas Start – International Box Office","This weekend saw milestones for Oppenheimer and Meg 2, continued success for Barbie and local-language movies as well as the entry of Blue Beetle","UPDATED: It’s been another very busy weekend at the international box office with milestones and great holds, as well as a new entry and local-language movies adding to the mix.

Coming off of a record-breaking debut in Korea, Christopher Nolan and Universal’s Oppenheimer led the overseas frame for the studios with a $32M session in 80 markets, pushing the global cume well past $700M, as we noted would be the case yesterday.

Warner Bros, meanwhile, has a lot going on. Barbie added $26.7M in 75 markets to lift worldwide to a high-heeled $1.279B. The studio’s China coproduction Meg 2: The Trench has now crossed $300M global, and its new offering, DC’s Blue Beetle landed within the expected range, bowing to $18M from 63 overseas markets.

At the same time, there is action aplenty for local titles in China and India (see more below).

Starting with the new studio entry this weekend, Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle scurried to an $18M opening in 63 markets, landing within the range we were hearing ahead of the weekend. In those starts, the Xolo Maridueña-starrer was No. 1 in 17. Combined with domestic, the global debut is $43.4M.

Regionally, Blue Beetle, from director Ángel Manuel Soto, was tops in Latin America, surpassing the debuts of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves by 27% and DC comp The Suicide Squad by 26%. The film was also the No. 1 title in many Asia markets, including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam. Western Europe was mixed, although France and Italy overperformed.

Breaking it down, Mexico was the top play at $2.7M, a No. 1 launch over the above comps and 478% ahead of the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (the market may have been impacted by Hurricane Hilary). Brazil grossed $2.1M at open, No. 1 on par with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and 42% over The Suicide Squad. France and the UK both took $1.5M – the former on par with The Suicide Squad and well ahead of TMNTMM, and the latter in line with Into the Spider-Verse on a weekend impacted by good weather and the women’s World Cup final. Rounding out the Top 5 openers, Indonesia bowed to $1.2M, dominating at 55% share of the market, above Into the Spider-Verse by 50%, The Suicide Squad by 964% and TMNTMM by over 2K%.

There are still 12 markets to come, including the Middle East this week and Australia in September.

Looking at the holdovers, Oppenheimer, as we reported yesterday, crossed $700M globally on Saturday, now with an estimated $717.8M through today. Just five weeks into release, it’s the 4th highest grossing Nolan film ever worldwide, having overtaken Interstellar. Oppenheimer is also the 4th biggest film of 2023 globally behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Barbie and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3

The current international frame is eyed at $32M in 80 markets for a $432.6M offshore cume to date. This is Nolan’s top film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.

The Cillian Murphy-led epic is the biggest Nolan film ever in 51 markets.

Korea had a fantastic debut, breaking records on Tuesday as the biggest Nolan launch day and the biggest Hollywood opening day of the year. The 6-day opening weekend of $12.6 million is the second biggest opening weekend for a Nolan film (only behind The Dark Knight Rises), the biggest Hollywood drama opening of all time and the 3rd biggest Hollywood start of the year. The standard 4-day weekend is well above Inception, almost double The Dark Knight and more than double Tenet – and in a competitive environment, to boot. It has already surpassed the lifetime of No Time To Die.

Also notable, the UK is now at $63.9M, performing in line with The Dark Knight Rises and Dunkirk. The $13M IMAX portion of that has exceeded Avatar: The Way of Water to become the No. 2 IMAX title ever in the market, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Germany has cumed $39.5M, France is at $31.2M, Australia has grossed $22.9M and Netherlands had a great hold at No. 1 (down just 28%) with a $16.1M cume through Sunday.

The IMAX global cume is $146.4M, now the 5th highest grossing IMAX title ever. For perspective, the Top 4 IMAX movies each earned over $2B in lifetime worldwide box office (Avatar, Avatar: The Way Of Water, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Endgame) whereas Oppenheimer is currently at the aforementioned $718M.

Internationally, the IMAX cume is $65.6M, good for Nolan’s best result ever in the format and the No. 7 biggest ever (No. 3 in like-for-like markets behind Avatar 1&2).

Italy and Greece open Oppenheimer this week, with China set for August 30.

The living doll that is Barbie is also continuing to show great strength. The 5th frame added $26.7M from 75 markets for a 42% drop. The overseas cume is now $711.9M with $1.279B global.

Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have delivered the 2nd biggest movie ever for WB globally and the 5th best internationally. This is the studio’s highest-grosser in 30 markets including the UK, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Poland.

Barbie’s Top 5 overseas markets through Sunday are the UK ($109.6M), Mexico ($53.2M), Australia ($51.1M), Germany ($47.4M) and Brazil ($43M).

Also from WB, Meg 2: The Trench had a meaty $21.9M third frame in 76 markets. The international running total now stands at $250.1M and the global cume to date is currently $316.6M. China is leading all play with $106.3M thus far, followed by Mexico ($18.3M), the UK ($12.5M), France ($9.9M) and Spain ($9.8M). Japan is still to release on August 25.

Sony’s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story took a sophomore lap of $6.3M, down a slight 37% in the small first wave of 34 offshore markets as it looks to build word of mouth ahead of wider rollout. The overseas total is $22.7M to date. Notable holds include the UAE (+36%), Kuwait (-12%), Qatar (-16%), Saudi Arabia (-29%) and France (-29%). Still to release are Brazil and Mexico next week, and China, Japan, Italy and Korea in September.

Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One ran up another $6.2M in 67 markets with a 45% drop. The offshore cume on the Tom Cruise-starrer is now $376.4M with $541M globally. Japan continues to race along at No. 1, now with a $31.5M cume, just under the UK which is at $32.3M to date.

Disney/Pixar’s Elemental fired up another $5.9M in 51 markets, lifting the overseas cume to $307.2M and global to $458.3M. The international weekend hold was -37%. Korea leads all play at a total $52.4M, followed by the UK ($20.8M), Mexico ($20.7M), France ($20.7M) and China ($15.9M).

In local titles, after a stellar start last frame, India’s Gadar 2 added an estimated $13.3M (the 2nd best 2nd weekend ever for a Bollywood title), for a $54M cume (448 crore) to date. It’s currently the No. 4 Bollywood movie ever in India, behind Pathaan, Dangal and PK. Also in its sophomore session, Jailer added an estimated $7.25M for a local cume of $40M.

China’s No More Bets anted up another estimated $65M, leading to a local running total of $376M. Maoyan currently has the Super Lion title reaching a final of $520M+. Getting there would make it the No. 3 movie of the year in the market. The IMAX cume is $9.7M. With this weekend, 2023 officially becomes IMAX’s biggest local-language year ever at $184M and with over four months still to go.

Greta Gerwig‘s cotton candy colored fantasy stars Margot Robbie as the iconic plastic doll as she voyages out of Barbie World into the real world alongside Ryan Gosling‘s Ken. Along the way, Barbie discovers that life outside of the Dreamhouse isn’t the progressive utopia she always thought it was — and Ken discovers something called the “patriarchy.” Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell round out the cast.

The rapturously reviewed film smashed expectations with its $155 million domestic debut, ranking as the biggest opening weekend of 2023, as well as the best start for a film directed by a woman. It arrived as a full-fledged phenomenon, thanks to the marketing campaign of the year and stellar word-of-mouth to match. There was also hype from “Barbenheimer,” the nickname for the twin release date with Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama “Oppenheimer.”

In his review of the film, Variety film critic Peter DeBruge writes that “Gerwig’s girl-power blockbuster offers a neon-pink form of inception all its own, planting positive examples of female potential for future generations. Meanwhile, by showing a sense of humor about the brand’s past stumbles, it gives us permission to challenge what Barbie represents — not at all what you’d expect from a feature-length toy commercial.”

,Margot Robbie never thought she'd have 'empathy for a doll.' Then she made 'Barbie.',"Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig open up about their ""profound"" and emotional ""Barbie"" movie, which reexamines a ""complicated icon.""","For Greta Gerwig, making “Barbie” was a divine calling.
The Oscar-nominated director brings tenderness and care to Mattel’s candy-coated summer comedy (in theaters Friday), elevating it far beyond what audiences might expect from a film about a plastic doll. Take, for instance, a scene where Barbie (Margot Robbie) meets Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), the toy’s inventor.
“There’s this shot where Ruth hands Barbie a cup of tea, and the way we lined it up is the exact way that God is touching Adam on the Sistine Chapel,"" Gerwig says. Rodrigo Prieto, the movie’s cinematographer, “was like: ‘Throw it in! Barbie deserves it. Michelangelo, let’s go!’ ”
Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie' movie looks at a 'complicated icon from all angles'
The film begins with Barbie living in perpetual bliss in Barbie Land, where she and her fellow Barbies have all the power and throw dance parties and sleepovers every night. But one day, Barbie wakes up feeling off: She has cellulite, flat feet and nagging thoughts of death. So she journeys to Los Angeles to find the girl who owns her – only to learn that Barbie dolls have been shunned by a new generation of kids.
Robbie, 33, produced the long-gestating project and sought out Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, to write the script. As a fan of Gerwig’s movies “Lady Bird” (2017) and “Little Women” (2019), she knew the filmmaker could bring something “dimensional and unexpected” to the story.
“ ‘Lady Bird’ feels like someone telling you, ‘We’re going to get through this experience together,’ ” says Robbie, speaking to USA TODAY prior to the Screen Actors Guild strike. “Same with ‘Little Women’ – it feels like a hug. It seems fitting and almost inevitable that the Barbie movie would feel that way. We can look at something that’s complicated and spiky, and not be mean-spirited and cynical. This movie is brimming with optimism, and maybe people weren’t expecting that from a Barbie movie.”
'Barbie' review:Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling dazzle in hilariously heady toy story
The film doesn’t shy away from the ridicule Barbie has received ever since she was introduced in 1959. Some critics say that the doll promotes consumerism and unrealistic body ideals and that she lives a vapid existence with her hunky arm candy, Ken (Ryan Gosling). But the movie astutely suggests that perhaps we’ve been holding Barbie to the same double standards that women across the globe have faced for centuries.
“One thing we really wanted to do was look at this complicated icon from all angles, but always approach everything with a big heart,” Gerwig says. “For every character, we wanted to give them a hug.”
Ryan Gosling's daughters helped him find the 'emotional core' of Ken
Gerwig, 39, says she has “never known Barbie without knowing the argument against Barbie.” Growing up, “my mom was one of those moms who wasn’t so sure about Barbie, so my first experience with Barbie was that she was a bit forbidden. I got a lot of hand-me-downs from girls in the neighborhood who were already missing shoes and had crazy hair.”
Talking to the film's cast and crew, she found that “everyone has an opinion about Barbie,” regardless of whether they grew up with them. Robbie would occasionally play with her cousin’s dolls, although she preferred building forts and making mud pies. Gosling’s daughters, meanwhile, helped him unlock “the emotional core” of Ken, who feels insecure and forgotten by Barbie.
“When we first talked, he said his daughters have Barbies and they did have a Ken somewhere, but he couldn’t find it,” Gerwig recalls. “And then he called me and said: ‘I found it. He’s under a rotting lemon outside, and I think that man’s story needs to be told.’ I was like, ‘You’re exactly right!’ ”
Margot Robbie says the film sparked 'big, profound conversations'
Since the movie’s most recent trailer in May, much of the excitement on social media has been around Gerwig’s ingenious eye for detail, whether it’s Barbie’s extravagant all-pink Dreamhouse or how she gracefully floats into her car (mimicking how a child might move their doll).
“Greta literally said, ‘I want everyone to feel like they can reach into the screen and pick everything up: every set, every prop, every costume,’” Robbie says.
Although she always figured the movie would be funny, what surprised the actress most was just how “moving” it ultimately is. After arriving in the real world, Barbie slowly starts to discover the breadth of human experience, from the catharsis of a good cry to the realization that change is inevitable.
“I didn’t know this character was going to get down into my bones in this way,” Robbie says. “I just didn’t ever expect to have so many big, profound conversations about the meaning of life or what true happiness is. I mean, we joke about an existential crisis, but it all did become very existential.”
As with every movie she has made, “you go on a journey with the character you’re playing and don’t really come out the other side the same. I just never expected to have this much empathy for a doll!”

2023-07-18 23:00:00+00:00,‘Barbie’ Review: Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling Compete for Control of High-Concept Living Doll Comedy,"Greta Gerwig loads plenty of food for thought in hot pink pop package, poking fun at patriarchy and corporate parent Mattel in brainy 'Barbie' movie.","Check out the brain on Barbie! Sure, she’s just a doll, but that doesn’t mean she has to be an airhead. Therein lies “Lady Bird” director Greta Gerwig’s inspired, 21st-century solution to bringing one of America’s most iconic playthings to life on the big screen. Combine that with the casting of Margot Robbie in the title role, and “Barbie” is already starting out on the right, perfectly arched foot. So what if this high-concept comedy falls a bit flat in the final stretch?
Barbie’s strength as a brand comes from her aspirational appeal. While some have rightly criticized the doll for setting unrealistic beauty standards, Barbie also showed girls they can do and be anything, as different models have portrayed her as president, a rocket scientist, even trans. You know who else sets unrealistic beauty standards? Movie stars. Like Barbie, they serve as role models, which is what makes Gerwig’s take on the ultra-popular toy line so darn smart. Robbie might be a dead-ringer for Barbie, but her moxie powers the performance. Gerwig has made the kind of family film she surely wishes had been available to her when she was a girl, sneaking a message (several of them, really) inside Barbie’s hollow hourglass figure.
That’s an admirable achievement, given understandably protective corporate parent Mattel — though let’s be honest, in the year 2023, it would be a shock (and box office suicide) if “Barbie” arrived without some kind of female-empowerment message baked in. This one checks all the right boxes, while making Ryan Gosling’s dumb-dumb Ken the butt of most of its gender-equity jokes. Boasting fresh tracks from Billie Eilish and Lizzo, the result is a very funny kids’ movie with a freshman liberal arts student’s vocabulary that tosses around terms like “patriarchy” and “appropriation” — pretty much everything but “problematic,” which the movie implies without actually calling Barbie’s legacy.
That’s the front on which Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s script feels most daring. “Barbie” doesn’t just poke fun at Mattel; it comes right out and accuses the bestselling doll of setting back the women’s movement. As one indignant teen tells Barbie: “You’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented.” This reproach stuns Robbie’s upbeat character, who wakes up every day in the always sunny, hot pink fantasy world where Barbies come in all colors and body types. They win Nobel Prizes and occupy all 12 seats on the Supreme Court. And they’re occasionally pestered by dozens of Ken dolls, who are clearly insecure about being sold (and kept) separately.
Barbie Land, as it’s called, is an inherently hilarious alternate reality modeled on the dream that Mattel has been selling American girls since the doll was introduced in 1959. It looks a lot like the one they’ve seen in countless commercials, where flamingo-bright Barbie Dreamhouses inspire envy as a diverse collection of perky, positive-minded dolls smile and wave at one another (represented here by such avatars as Alexandra Shipp and Dua Lipa, Issa Rae and Ritu Aryu, Hari Nef and Sharon Rooney). It’s a wild pop-art space, all but exploding with supersaturated color, where the doll heads appear lower contrast and backlit, obliging us to squint to make out the actors’ faces.
You half-expect to see a giant hand reach in from the sky to interact with these lifelike toys, but that’s not how it works. Instead, Gerwig enlists Helen Mirren as narrator to lay out the rules, pausing now and then to spotlight specific costumes, interject vintage TV spots or cast shade on discontinued products — such as Growing Up Skipper, with her inflatable bust; pregnant Midge; or questionable-taste offerings like Sugar Daddy and Tanner, a flocked dog that poops plastic pellets.
Although Robbie’s blond-haired, fair-skinned Stereotypical Barbie seems to possess some abstract notion of herself as a toy, there’s a major disconnect between inventor Ruth Handler’s best intentions and the state of things in the Real World (where the movie spends roughly half its time): “Thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved,” Mirren sarcastically summarizes. One evening, in the middle of a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie blurts out, “You guys ever think about dying?” The next morning, she’s horrified to find her feet have flattened and a patch of cellulite has appeared. What could be threatening her near-perfect physique?
The answer lies in the Real World, where Barbie and Ken (Gosling’s Ken, not the ones played by Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena and others) steer her pink Corvette, emerging at Venice Beach wearing matching fluorescent Hot Skatin’ ensembles. Yes, “Barbie” is one of those movies, like “The Smurfs” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” where imaginary characters cross over to modern-day America — just infinitely more clever. Instead of using the premise as a setup for slapstick, Gerwig shows Barbie defending herself when some random guy slaps her butt, getting a knuckle sandwich in return.
The script is no less on-the-nose about its politics, and in any case, Gerwig and Baumbach’s social critiques seem more than reasonable. Their script merely emphasizes how lopsided the Real World remains in its treatment of women, up to and including Mattel’s corporate headquarters, where a working mom named Gloria (America Ferrara) holds an entry-level job, while the boardroom is packed entirely with guys in suits. At the head of the table sits Will Ferrell in what is easily the film’s laziest casting choice. (Hasn’t he played a dozen versions of this character before, most obviously starring as Lord Business in “The Lego Movie”?) Defaulting to Ferrell means passing up the chance to create a memorable original embodiment of the kind of men who run corporate America.
At the same time Barbie is experiencing her rude awakening, Ken’s busy filling his empty head with all the possibilities that “patriarchy” entails. In Barbie Land, Ken’s job is a deliberately ill-defined afterthought (basically, just “beach”), whereas in the Real World, dudes rule — an idea he takes back to Barbie Land with pointedly absurd results, brainwashing all the women into behaving like obedient housewives. The film’s draggier second half gets both silly and unabashedly strident, as Stereotypical Barbie seeks help from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a damaged-goods doll with singed hair and messed-up makeup who serves as this girly-girl world’s Morpheus-like sage.
It’s upsetting (in a useful way) to see Barbie confronted with the overnight impact of rampant patriarchy, a concept that has rarely looked more off-putting than the frat-boy fantasy caricatured here. Think of it as the misogynist alternative marketed by old-school beer commercials, the polar opposite of Mattel’s mid-’80s “We girls can do anything. Right, Barbie?” campaign. While the Barbies plot to take back the government, Gerwig gives all the Ken dolls an over-the-top musical number, “I’m Just Ken,” which is so amusingly self-involved it risks subverting the very point the movie’s trying to make. If “Barbie” is all about centering and celebrating women, why let Ken steal the show?
Gosling is a good sport to play the slightly predatory, sartorially helpless pretty boy, as the spray-tanned ex-Mouseketeer parodies his popular “hey girl” persona, flexing both his muscles and a range of facial expressions all but lacking from his recent work. If Robbie’s Barbie sets an impossibly high bar for young women, then Gosling’s Ken reps an equally formidable male model, with his chiseled abs and cheekbones.
That factor hasn’t escaped Gerwig, who sets out to disrupt such unattainable aesthetic standards, calling out ways the doll’s idealized design can harm self-esteem and encourage eating disorders. She crams most of that critique into a single motormouthed monologue, which drew cheers at the premiere and which, on closer inspection, contains not a single controversial idea. In the end, the trouble with “Barbie” isn’t that it goes too far, but that it stops short, building to a conceptual scene between Barbie and her Creator (Rhea Perlman) that inadvertently underscores one of the movie’s few failings: It’s an intellectual experience, not an emotional one, grounded largely in audience nostalgia.
The power of nostalgia ought not be underestimated with a property like this, as much of Gerwig’s approach skews toward grown women and gay audiences who’ve owned the dolls — and for whom she’s embedded deep-cut trivia and hidden references throughout. The movie was clearly made by people who understand how kids’ imaginations work when playing with Barbies, even if Gerwig uses the project as the delivery device for what sounds like an undergraduate gender studies lecture at times. Most of its points are positive ones for young girls to hear, while those that earned the film its PG-13 rating will fly right over their heads as they feast on all the eye candy, including re-creations of classic looks by Jacqueline Durran (costumes) and Sarah Greenwood (production design).
It’s kind of perfect that “Barbie” is opening opposite Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” since Gerwig’s girl-power blockbuster offers a neon-pink form of inception all its own, planting positive examples of female potential for future generations. Meanwhile, by showing a sense of humor about the brand’s past stumbles, it gives us permission to challenge what Barbie represents — not at all what you’d expect from a feature-length toy commercial.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL3Jldmlld3MvYmFyYmllLXJldmlldy1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXJ5YW4tZ29zbGluZy0xMjM1NjcyMzQ5L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL3Jldmlld3MvYmFyYmllLXJldmlldy1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXJ5YW4tZ29zbGluZy0xMjM1NjcyMzQ5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Barbie reviews: What do critics make of the Margot Robbie film?,"One review calls the film ""painfully funny"", but another describes it as ""uneven and disjointed"".","Barbie reviews: What do critics make of the Margot Robbie film?
By Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter
Warner Bros
Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play Barbie and Ken in Greta Gerwig's Barbie
Life in plastic is mostly fantastic according to many critics, who have broadly praised the Barbie movie.
The much-publicised film is released this Friday - opposite Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer - and stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
Empire said Barbie was ""painfully funny"", while the Independent described it as ""joyous from minute to minute"".
But the Daily Mail called it ""uneven and disjointed"", while Time said it was ""very pretty but not very deep"".
Robbie stars as the doll in director Greta Gerwig's film, which has been made with co-operation from toy manufacturer Mattel.
In a five-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said: ""Barbie is one of the most inventive, immaculately crafted and surprising mainstream films in recent memory - a testament to what can be achieved within even the deepest bowels of capitalism.
""While it's impossible for any studio film to be truly subversive, especially when consumer culture has caught on to the idea that self-awareness is good for business, Barbie gets away with far more than you'd think was possible.""

The Telegraph's Robbie Collin was also positive, awarding the film four stars and describing it as ""deeply bizarre, conceptually slippery and often roar-out-loud hilarious"".
""It's an unexpected pleasure to report that Greta Gerwig's film - while still fundamentally being a summer comedy adventure about the Barbie toy line - is far from the blunt-force cash grab many of us feared,"" he wrote.
""The satirical angle - likelier to strike a chord with older viewers than pre-teens - is enthusiastically and mischievously milked. (There are gags here that gleefully poke a number of masculine online beehives.)""

However, the Daily Mail's Sarah Vine was less keen on the representation of men. She wrote: ""It's a deeply anti-man movie, an extension of all that TikTok feminism that paints any form of masculinity - other than the most anodyne - as toxic and predatory...
""Every male character is either an idiot, a bigot or a sad, rather pathetic loser. If the roles were reversed, and a male director made a film about how all women were hysterical, neurotic, gold-digging witches, it would be denounced - quite rightly - as deeply offensive and sexist.""
She concluded: ""It's uneven, disjointed, the plot makes no real sense - and the dead hand of corporate America weighs heavily upon it.""
Warner Bros
The film has been directed by Greta Gerwig (second right), whose other credits include Lady Bird and Little Women
The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw also gave a lukewarm review, awarding the film three stars.
He suggested Barbie is ""a good-natured but self-conscious movie"" that is ""occasionally very funny, but sometimes also somehow demure and inhibited, as if the urge to be funny can only be mean and satirical"".
He added: ""This movie is perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product, although no more so than The Lego Movie, yet Barbie doesn't go for the comedy jugular anywhere near as gleefully as that.""
Other critics were far more positive. Rolling Stone's David Fear said Barbie ""may be the most subversive blockbuster of the 21st Century"", while NME's Alex Flood noted the script ""contains unexpected subtlety"".
Barbie received its UK premiere last Wednesday - one of the last major showbiz events to be held before the Hollywood actors' strike was announced by industry union SAG.
Warner Bros
Empire said Robbie's performance is ""hilarious"" while Gosling is a ""scene-stealer"" as Ken
Empire's Beth Webb praised Robbie and Gosling's performances as Barbie and Ken in her four-star review.
""Robbie - who has been dialling it up to 11 since Harley Quinn - is hilarious, but the most consistent scene-stealer is Mr. Blond Fragility,"" she said.
""Gosling submerges wholeheartedly into Ken's insecure psyche as he moves from Barbie's sidepiece to patriarchal poster boy. Every muscle flex, every hair flick, every guitar strum lands perfectly. There are moments where he will rob you of breath.""
There was also praise for the film's director from Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly, who said: ""Never doubt Gerwig.
""The Oscar-nominated filmmaker has crafted a fierce, funny, and deeply feminist adventure that dares you to laugh and cry, even if you're made of plastic.""
Lovia Gyarkye of the Hollywood Reporter struck a more dissenting note, writing: ""However smartly done Gerwig's Barbie is, an ominousness haunts the entire exercise.
""The director has successfully etched her signature into and drawn deeper themes out of a rigid framework, but the sacrifices to the story are clear. The muddied politics and flat emotional landing of Barbie are signs that the picture ultimately serves a brand.""
Warner Bros
The film is released on Friday - the same day as Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer
Other reviews had different criticisms, with Deadline's Valerie Complex describing Barbie as ""an imperfect film"".
""It stumbles somewhat in its handling of its characters of colour. They mostly are used as devices to push the Stereotypical Barbie and Ken narratives forward,"" she said.
""There is a tight 95-minute movie here, but it's crammed with pointless dance scenes and musical numbers that are just filler and nothing else.""
Johnny Oleksinski of the New York Post went further, describing Barbie as an ""overwrought disappointment"".
""The packaging of Barbie is a lot more fun than the tedious toy inside the box,"" he said. ""To almost quote the Aqua song: Life in plastic - not fantastic.""
The tone of the film was criticised by Time's Stephanie Zacharek, who said: ""It's a movie that's enormously pleased with itself. Barbie never lets us forget how clever it's being, every exhausting minute.""
PA Media
Barbie's London premiere last week was one of the last major showbiz events before the actors' strike

,Margot Robbie Predicted 'Barbie' Would 'Make a Billion Dollars' in Early Pitch Meeting,"Margot Robbie said in an interview with 'Collider' that she predicted 'Barbie' would make $1 billion — which it has, just over two weeks after release","Margot Robbie always knew Barbie would be a hit.
The actress stars as the titular Mattel doll in the Greta Gerwig-directed film, which just crossed $1 billion at the global box office. Robbie also serves as a co-producer on Barbie alongside husband Tom Ackerley plus David Heyman and Mattel Films Executive Producer Robbie Brenner.
Before Barbie achieved its box-office milestone, which the film clinched just over two weeks after its release, Robbie, 33, told Collider, ""I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they’re brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director.""
One example she gave in ""naming anything that’s been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years"" was ""dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg.""
""And I was like, 'And now you’ve got Barbie and Greta Gerwig,' "" Robbie said. ""And I think I told them that it’d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?!""

Featuring an extensive star-studded cast led by Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Barbie passed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales on Sunday, making Gerwig the first female director to hit this box office milestone as a solo director.
Barbie became Warner Bros. Pictures' biggest-selling film for a Monday ever following its $155 million domestic opening weekend, and the industry's biggest opening weekend for a movie directed by a woman.
The movie's success has led Mattel, the toy company that owns the Barbie brand, to make plans to adapt 14 additional Mattel properties — including a Polly Pocket movie, directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins — for the silver screen.
Other Mattel movie projects with directors, actors or notable producers attached include a Hot Wheels film produced by J.J. Abrams, a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots movie starring Vin Diesel, the Daniel Kaluuya-led Barney film and a Major Matt Mason movie starring Tom Hanks.

Both Gerwig, 40, and Robbie have spoken out about the possibility of more Barbie movies in the future, with the director telling PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue that she hopes her film ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.""
""There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,"" Gerwig added. ""I want to go back to Barbie Land.""
As for Robbie, the two-time Oscar nominee said during a cover interview with TIME magazine published in June, ""I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels.""
Still, she has been part of conversations about what the future holds for Barbie in terms of a cinematic experience to follow the first movie. ""It could go a million different directions from this point,"" Robbie said.

2023-07-11 20:25:11+00:00,Margot Robbie Press Tour Looks Inspired By Actual Barbies,Margot Robbie's press tour looks for 'Barbie' have taken inspiration from actual looks worn by the famous doll over the years.,"The marketing rollout for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie has been impressive, ubiquitous, and extremely pink, spanning countless brand collaborations and in-person activations, like the life-size pink Barbie Dream House in Malibu, now listed on Airbnb. But some of the most compelling marketing for the film comes straight from its star, Margot Robbie.
As Robbie, who plays the world-famous doll in the film, has promoted Barbie ahead of its July 21 release, fans have delighted in her impeccable red carpet recreations of Barbie’s most glamorous looks from over the years. Working with stylist Andrew Mukamal, Robbie has sported high fashion versions of iconic outfits worn by Barbie in different eras, from the legendary black and white striped swimsuit worn by the first Barbie in 1959 to the hot pink day-to-night working woman ensemble that a career-minded doll wore in 1985. According to Robbie, the recreations are tributes to Barbie fans.

“We’re finding Barbie references from decades past and just doing it really for the big Barbie fans out there, people who are actually collecting those Barbies,” Robbie told People at the film’s premiere in Los Angeles, where she wore a custom Schiaparelli recreation of the black cocktail dress worn by the 1960 “Solo in the Spotlight” Barbie. “We’re hoping to get them excited… We’re pairing Barbie references with great designers.”
Robbie has likely sported her last Barbie-themed look ahead of the movie’s release date because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, which officially launched on July 13. The strike unites members of the actors’ and writers’ unions on the picket line for the first time in more than 60 years, and prevents actors from doing promoting their film and TV projects. Robbie’s July 12 red carpet outfit for Barbie may have been a subtle nod to the historic shutdown. Her pale pink Vivienne Westwood gown was a tribute to the “Enchanted Evening” Barbie—which, blogger Lainey Gossip pointed out, was released in 1960, the same year that actors and writers were last on strike at the same time.

That Robbie’s tour looks became a fashion phenomenon is fitting, given that Barbie creator Ruth Handler always intended for fashion to be a major part of the doll’s appeal. Fed up with the lack of toy options for girls, who typically could choose between baby dolls or paper dolls to play with, Handler created one through which they could embody their future dreams—in part by dressing her in different outfits.

To recreate this flirty pink polka dot outfit, Mukamal turned to the archives of Valentino, taking inspiration from a maroon polka dot halter neck midi dress from the fashion house’s Spring/Summer 1993 collection. For Robbie’s look, Valentino updated the design in a bright pink and white polka dot fabric and shortened the hem to be a mini dress, which Mukamal paired with a yellow Valentino Rockstud purse, white Manolo Blahnik pumps, and a set of Assael pearl earrings and matching bracelet.

For this iconic look, Mukamal pulled a black and white strapless bandage dress from Hervé Legér to pay homage to Barbie’s black and white striped one-piece swimsuit, then accessorized it with a pair of white Jacques Marie Mage cat eye sunglasses with blue lenses, Spinelli Kilcollin hoop earrings, and a pair of black Manolo Blahnik peep toe heeled mules.

For the Barbie premiere in South Korea, Mukamal re-created not one but two looks for the red carpet to pay tribute to the versatile style of Barbie as a working woman. For the first “day” look, he dressed Robbie in an Atelier Versace fuchsia skirt suit with white accents, which he accessorized with an ascot tie, boater hat, matching Manolo Blahnik spectator pumps, and a jeweled Judith Leiber purse shaped like a cell phone from the time. For the second “night” look, Robbie wore a party dress in the same shade of fuchsia with a full tulle skirt and matching peep toe heeled mules from Manolo Blahnik.

The inspiration for this outfit comes from a 1964 Barbie who wore a sparkling pink sheath dress with a matching jacket and pillbox hat. To recreate it, Mukamal dressed Robbie in an embellished dress and jacket set from Moschino, which he paired with a bow-festooned pillbox hat, matching Manolo Blahnik peep toe heeled mules, and a matching quilted heart purse.

To recreate the look of the “Earring Magic” Barbie doll that debuted in 1992, Mukamal enlisted Balmain to create a hot pink mini dress with sheer sleeves and a leather bustier dress, which was paired with large star earrings and a matching star chain belt.

While the most outstanding feature of the 1992 “Totally Hair” Barbie doll may have been her ankle-length tresses, her swirl print mini dress gave it some serious competition. To recreate this look, Mukamal dressed Robbie in a Pucci mini dress and paired it with a pink Chanel purse, hot pink Manolo Blahnik pumps, and Taffin earrings.
Solo in the Spotlight Barbie, 1960

For the Barbie premiere in L.A., Mukamal drew inspiration from one of the most iconic Barbie looks of all time—the “Solo in the Spotlight” Barbie, who sports a sparkling black strapless sheath dress with a voluminous hem. To bring this look to life, he tapped Schiaparelli to recreate the dress, down to the red rose detail on the hem. Like the Barbie, Robbie accessorized with black opera gloves, black Manolo Blahnik peep toe heeled mules, a Lorraine Schwartz diamond necklace and earrings, and a pink handkerchief.

To recreate the ultra-femme formal outfit worn by 1960’s “Enchanted Evening” Barbie, Mukamal pulled a corseted pink Vivienne Westwood gown with a train and rosette detail at the waist. Robbie’s hair was also styled in an updo reminiscent of the doll’s high ponytail. He paired the look with a fur stole, an Assael cultured pearl choker, and embellished Christian Louboutin pumps.

2023-07-21 07:00:00+00:00,Why Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling Are the Perfect Barbie and Ken,"Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling obviously nailed the look, but there are a number of reasons why Greta Gerwig's film struck casting gold.","Watch : How Barbie Is EMPOWERING Everyone
Margot Robbie has proved time and again that she can do anything—much like a certain 12-inch-tall fashion doll who first popped into the collective consciousness in 1959 and never left.
Initially dressed for the beach, Barbie has since evolved into a convertible-driving, DreamHouse-owning doctor-businesswoman-rock star-astronaut-president who means something to everyone, including those who've never owned one of the billion-plus Barbies sold. She's been around long enough to both inspire and offend, all while remaining impeccably dressed, lavishly coiffed (except when you played hair stylist with real scissors), happily unmarried (minus her Bridal incarnations) and anatomically impossible.
And now, finally, she's got her own movie that promises to unpack all of the above from her signature pink box.
""Hopefully by the end of it,"" Robbie told E! News' chief correspondent Keltie Knight, ""you are thinking about life and what it means to be alive, and how tricky but rewarding that is.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ld3MvMTM4MDY2NC93aHktbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1hbmQtcnlhbi1nb3NsaW5nLWFyZS10aGUtcGVyZmVjdC1iYXJiaWUtYW5kLWtlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-26 17:32:50+00:00,Margot Robbie Was Right: ‘Barbie’ Will Be a Billion-Dollar Movie,"""Oppenheimer"" is also beating all box-office expectations.","When pitching “Barbie” to Warner Bros. executives, producer and star Margot Robbie laid it out: Universal has dinosaurs and Steven Spielberg, WBD could have Barbie and Greta Gerwig. As she told Collider, “And I think I told them that it’d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, OK?!”
This is a woman who knows the future. Based on estimates for Tuesday’s grosses, Gerwig’s film added $26 million to its domestic take this week. The second weekend will be vital to narrow the guess, but the domestic range could be anywhere from $500 million-$800 million. With over $400 million in worldwide in less than a week, a $1 billion total theatrical take seems increasingly likely.
“Oppenheimer” should achieve about half of that. It grossed a little over $12.0 million on Monday and Tuesday. A range for the domestic estimate is $250 million-$400 million.
The weekday ratio for the two films mirrors what we saw over the weekend ($162 million to $82 million), with holds much better than the norm. Tuesday usually sees an uptick of 25-30 percent thanks to discounted tickets, but near-capacity films are the exception because the lower ticket prices reduce the gross. In this case, “Barbie” was nearly even with Monday and “Oppenheimer” only dropped five percent.
“Oppenheimer” Melinda Sue Gordon
These weekday results strongly suggest that “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are more than just initial sensations. After five days, “Barbie” is at $214.1 million, “Oppenheimer” $100.1 million. (Through 14 days, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is at $124 million). “Barbie” also definitively achieved the year’s best opening: “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” grossed $204 million after five days, and “Barbie” might match the animated hit’s first-week total of $240 million by Wednesday.
“Barbie” is also significantly ahead of both “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Avatar: The Way of Water.” After five days, “Maverick” grossed $176 million, including Memorial Day. James Cameron’s sequel grossed $168 million by the same point.
“Oppenheimer” is also a strong performer, although its grosses are hampered by fewer shows and the demand for limited-seating premium screenings. It should earn over $120 million in its first week.
“Barbie”
To calculate full run projections for “Barbie,” we start from its current $214 million. It lacks the Christmas uplift that elevated “No Way Home” and “Avatar,” and faces more competition in the weeks ahead. However, it also has additional prime summer weeks (athough fewer than “Maverick”).
To beat “Mario” as best for 2023, it needs to hit $579 million — and there’s a good chance of that. Still to be determined is how many repeat viewings it will see, which is key to achieving stratospheric numbers.
“Oppenheimer” appeal is more limited, although it’s vastly exceeded expectations. Its bigger weekday drop than “Barbie” is likely due to a smaller pool of weekday viewers available for a three-hour film. Advance expectation suggested it could hold better than “Barbie” with its appeal to older viewers, who often don’t see it on the first weekend.
Assuming that happens, it falls into a very imprecise range of $250 million-$400 million. As with “Barbie,” even the lower end of this would be fantastic. Initial foreign grosses for both so far have been a little ahead of domestic.
At the high end “Oppenheimer” could be third best of the year, behind only “Super Mario” and “Barbie.” “Barbie” will easily top “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which will end up around $385 million, and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” ($359 million). “Oppenheimer” has a shot to get close to both of these hits; that’s unexpected.
Based on results so far, “Oppenheimer” seems headed for between $400 million- $500 million worldwide. That would exceed the most optimistically pre-release projections.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL2JhcmJpZS13aWxsLWJlLWEtYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItbW92aWUtbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS13YXMtcmlnaHQtMTIzNDg4ODIzNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-16 16:28:36+00:00,'Barbie' star Margot Robbie has made $50 million from success of $1 billion film: report,"The 10-digit payday, which includes her reported $12.5 million upfront rate, would be one of the biggest ever received by an actress.","This Barbie is making bank.
The runaway success of ""Barbie"" at the worldwide box office has resulted in a massive payday for producer and star Margot Robbie.
The 33-year-old actor has reportedly taken home $50 million in salary and box office bonuses, according to a report in Variety which cited three sources with knowledge of her deal.
""Barbie"" recently became the 51st film to sell more than $1 billion worth of tickets at the global box office, and this week surpassed 2008's ""The Dark Knight"" as the highest-grossing film ever released by Warner Bros.
The 10-digit payday, which includes her reported $12.5 million upfront rate, would be one of the biggest ever received by an actress. It puts her within striking distance of Sandra Bullock, who hauled in a reported $70 million for 2014's ""Gravity.""
And her pay is expected to grow as ""Barbie"" continues to perform well at the box office. It brought in more than $30 million in its fourth weekend and is on pace to be the highest-grossing movie of the year.
But Robbie still has a ways to go to take the crown for biggest Hollywood payday ever. That title belongs to Tom Cruise, who reportedly received over $100 million following the massive success of last year's ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" which earned roughly $1.5 billion at the box office.
Robbie has come a long way since she first started acting. Last month, she revealed that her mom helped keep her afloat by borrowing against her home.
""She'd take money out of the house mortgage and lend me money,"" Robbie told CBS Sunday Morning. ""So I always knew, 'Oh, I've gotta pay that back.'""
Robbie said that she kept careful track of everything her mom lent her by writing it down on a piece of paper.
""And one day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely,"" she said. ""I was like, 'Mom, don't even worry about that mortgage anymore. It doesn't exist anymore.'""

,"Hi, Barbie! Margot Robbie's 'Barbie' tops box office for second week with $93 million","Greta Gerwig's fantasy comedy “Barbie” took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.","Jake Coyle
The Associated Press
A week later, the “Barbenheimer” boom has not abated.
Seven days after Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. “Barbie” took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. “Oppenheimer” stayed in second with a robust $46.2 million. Sales for the two movies dipped 43% and 44%, respectably — well shy of the usual week-two drops.
“Barbenheimer” has proven to be not a one-weekend phenomenon but an ongoing box-office bonanza. The two movies combined have already surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, call it “a touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters.”
“Having two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each other's fortunes — both box-office wise and it terms of their profile — I don't know if there's a comp for this in the annals of box-office history,"" said Dergarabedian. “There's really no comparison for this.”
Following its year-best $162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of “Barbie” saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolan's “The Dark Knight"" to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever.
“Barbie” has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day it’s played, “Barbie"" has made at least $20 million.
And the “Barbie” effect isn't just in North America. The film made $122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached $775 million. It's the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives.
“That's a crazy number,” said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. “There's just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world.""
Amid the frenzy, “Barbie” is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12% of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again.
For a movie industry that has been trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing — and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes — the sensations of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have showed what's possible when everything lines up just right.
“Post-pandemic, there's no ceiling and there's no floor,"" said Goldstein. ""The movies that miss, really miss big time and the movies that work really work big time.""
Universal Pictures' “Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking.
Nolan’s drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, “Oppenheimer” has already surpassed $400 million globally.
Showings in IMAX have typically been sold out. “Oppenheimer” has made $80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the film's run through Aug. 13.
The week’s top new release, Walt Disney Co.’s “Haunted Mansion,” an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales. “Haunted Mansion,” directed by Justin Simien (“Dear White People,” “Bad Hair”) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.

“Talk to Me,” the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.
While theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, it’s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with “Top Gun: Maverick.” “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,” which debuted the week before the arrival of “Barbenheimer,” grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed $139.2 million domestically and $309.3 million oveseas.
Instead, the sleeper hit “Sound of Freedom” has been the best performing non-“Barbenheimer” release in theaters. The Angel Studios’ release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million.
Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

2023-07-03 10:17:23+00:00,‘Barbie’ Banned in Vietnam Over Disputed Map Scene,Warner Bros.' 'Barbie' will be banned in Vietnam over a depiction of a map that appears to violate the country's sovereignty.,"Authorities in Vietnam have banned commercial screenings of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.”
The Warner Bros. film starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, one of the most anticipated movies of the summer, was set to have been released in the country on July 21.
The film contains a scene that depicts a map with the “nine dash line,” a representation of China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, which Vietnam says violates its sovereignty.
Vi Kien Thanh, director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, said on Monday that the ban was decided by the National Film Evaluation Council.
Warner Bros. has not responded to Variety’s requests for comment.
Many of China’s neighbors, including Vietnam, have competing and overlapping territorial claims and strongly dispute China’s assertions. In 2016, a United Nations disputes resolution tribunal in The Hague ruled unanimously against the validity of the ‘nine dash line.’ However, while the South China Sea arbitration was final and binding, there are no clear mechanisms for its implementation and China has said it does not recognize the decision.
“We do not grant license for the American movie ‘Barbie’ to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line,” said the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper, also citing Vi Kien Thanh.
Similar depictions of the “nine dash line” have previously caused problems for multiple films and TV series in Vietnam.
DreamWorks’ animated film “Abominable” was banned for the same reason in 2019 and Sony’s “Unchartered” suffered the same fate last year. Exhibitor CGV was fined for showing “Abominable,” and staff at the Vietnam Cinema Department were disciplined for not immediately spotting the offending images. The film was pulled after just over a week in cinemas.
In 2020, the series “Put Your Head On My Shoulder” and “Madam Secretary” were told to delete scenes containing the map. Meanwhile, in 2021, Netflix was ordered to removed Australian spy drama “Pine Gap” from the Vietnamese market.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLWJhbm5lZC12aWV0bmFtLW1vdmllLXdhcm5lci1icm9zLTEyMzU2NjAzMTcv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtYmFubmVkLXZpZXRuYW0tbW92aWUtd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtMTIzNTY2MDMxNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Margot Robbie paid off her mom’s mortgage after years of saving,The “Barbie” actress landed a $12.5 million payday after starring in the box office sensation.,"Margot Robbie may have landed a $12.5 million payday after starring in box office sensation Barbie, but paying back the person who put her on the path to global stardom was always her priority long before landing the iconic Mattel role.
Robbie, who was raised by her mom in Queensland, Australia, landed a part in the popular Aussie soap Neighbours at the age of 17.
Since then, she has gone on to star in a string of box office hits including The Wolf of Wall Street; I, Tonya; and The Suicide Squad—but despite earning millions from acting in and producing movies, Robbie’s main goal wasn’t to splurge on herself.
While Robbie pursued a career in Hollywood, her mom supported her financially, sometimes taking money out of her mortgage to help her daughter chase her dream.
“One day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely,” Robbie revealed in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning. “I was like, ‘Mom, don’t even worry about that mortgage anymore. It doesn’t even exist anymore.’”
During her early career, the A-list actress kept a list of every cent her mom had lent her.
“She’d take money out of the house mortgage and lend me money, so I always knew, ‘Oh, I’ve got to pay that back,’” she told CBS. “I have that piece of paper still. I kept it. Everything I owed my mom, I had it written down.”
“Honestly, anyone in my position, you’d do that for your mom,” she added. “Of course you would.”
Robbie is one of many celebrities who have used their financial success to support their parents.
Australian actor Chris Hemsworth—who also appeared on Neighbours before his big break—reportedly paid off all of his parents’ debts after making it in Hollywood.
Meanwhile, Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan bought a house in California for his parents in 2016.
Robbie was paid $12.5 million for playing the titular role in Barbie, according to Variety—giving her the highest salary of any actress in Hollywood last year.

Gerwig was talking about the time the crew spent filming a rollerblading scene in Venice Beach. Set photos from the scene, featuring Robbie and Gosling in neon outfits, exploded on social media last summer during production.
“How Barbie operates in Barbieland is she’s entirely continuous with her environment,” Gerwig said. “Even the houses have no walls, because you never need to hide because there’s nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed of. And suddenly finding yourself in the real world and wishing you could hide, that’s the essence of being human. But when we were actually shooting on Venice Beach, with Margot and Ryan in neon rollerblading outfits, it was fascinating because it was actually happening in front of us.”
“People would go by Ryan, high-five him, and say, ‘Awesome, Ryan, you look great!’ And they wouldn’t actually say anything to Margot,” Gerwig said. “They’d just look at her. It was just surreal. In that moment, she did feel self-conscious. And as the director, I wanted to protect her. But I also knew that the scene we were shooting had to be the scene where she felt exposed. And she was exposed, both as a celebrity and as a lady.”
Gerwig added, “To be fair, Ryan was like, ‘I wish I wasn’t wearing this vest.’ But it was a different kind of discomfort.”
The rollerblading outfits became one of the first viral sensations to emerge from the “Barbie” movie. Appearing on “The Tonight Show” last year, Robbie called the photo leaks “mortifying.”
“I can’t tell you how mortified we were, by the way,” Robbie said when host Jimmy Fallon showed the “Barbie” set photo to viewers. “We look like we’re like laughing and having fun, but we’re dying on the inside. Dying. I was like, this is the most humiliating moment of my life.”
When asked if she ever thought the “Barbie” set photos would dominate internet buzz the way they did, Robbie responded, “No! I mean, I knew that we had some exteriors to shoot in L.A. I knew once you were doing exteriors, you’re gonna get papped. There’s probably going to be a little crowd of people who are going to take notice because, you know, we stand out a little bit in those outfits. So I knew there was going to be a little bit of attention, and probably some photos would get out there, but not like it did.”
Robbie concluded, “It was like mad. It was like hundreds of people watching all the time.”

2023-06-26 14:30:00+00:00,The Super Fun ‘Barbie’ Soundtrack Is About to Take Over the World,"Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie, Mark Ronson, Charli XCX, PinkPantheress, and others dish on the highly anticipated all-star soundtrack for ‘Barbie.’","Barbie opens with the world’s favorite doll having the perfect day: She has her perfect world full of other perfect Barbies who may look and dress differently but act exactly the same. And there’s the doting love of Ken, whose existence is mostly an accessory to Barbie’s. The next day, it all goes terribly, terribly wrong. Soundtracking it is “Pink,” by Lizzo, a song that describes exactly what Barbie is experiencing onscreen — a campy touch of Eighties TV tropes to build out her pastel world.
“Lizzo’s lyrics are just so funny,” says main Barbie Margot Robbie, “and add an extra layer of comedy that I thought was quite genius.”
The Barbie soundtrack is one of the most important weapons in writer-director Greta Gerwig’s arsenal. Many of the film’s scenes have highly specific musical cues that she was seeking, which means she needed a team on board from the beginning to make the vision come alive.
“You’re hearing lyrics that are responding to what’s happening onscreen, so the music became more than just music — it became a device to enhance what the audience was watching and experiencing, and got to be the voice of the audience,” adds Robbie.
Atlantic nabbed the project early, working closely with Gerwig and her co-writer husband, Noah Baumbach.
“This was a really competitive project in our landscape, but we’ve been tracking Barbie for a long time,” says Kevin Weaver, Atlantic Records’ West Coast president. The label was a particularly strong partner for this project, having dominated the soundtrack market over the past several years, thanks to albums for Robbie’s Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey, as well as the Fast and the Furious franchise and the recent Daisy Jones & the Six.
The Barbie team knew they needed two songs in particular as soon as possible: a showstopping pop number for a highly choreographed dance scene, and a big Eighties-style power ballad for Ken, played by Ryan Gosling.
That was when Oscar- and seven-time Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter Mark Ronson (A Star Is Born) got a text from his music-supervisor pal George Drakoulias. “Barbie?” is all it said. Ronson Zoomed with the Barbie squad while they were in England prepping for production. They told him they needed at least the basis of a song for the showstopper in two weeks. Editor’s picks

“I don’t read a lot of scripts, but it was just everything I want in a movie,” Ronson recalls. “I was like, ‘If I don’t get this gig, this is gonna be my favorite movie of the year.’ ”
Along with collaborator Andrew Wyatt, the pair cooked up the beat to the disco dance-floor burner “Dance the Night,” based off a playlist of songs Gerwig had put together for them. Luckily, Gerwig loved what they sent her.
“We did all our dance rehearsals to the beat of the song before the lyrics were overlaid on top,” Robbie recalls. “It became the Barbie anthem on set. The dance-rehearsal time was really the first opportunity for all the actors playing Barbies to bond and make friends.”
Disco felt like the perfect reference point for what Barbie experiences, especially after she steps into the real world. As Gerwig told Robbie: “Disco comes with the assumption that people want to dance and have a good time. It didn’t realize it stopped being cool in the Seventies. Disco had no idea people started listening to punk rock. Disco is still there, in bell-bottoms, doing its thing.’”

“Dance the Night,” which was written for fellow Barbie star Dua Lipa to perform, is intrinsic to the DNA of the film, according to Weaver. But Ronson and Wyatt also became integral to the story: Together, the twosome composed an original score for the movie, and Ronson serves as executive producer for the soundtrack. Over nearly a full year, Ronson was tasked with helping curate songs that perfectly matched what Gerwig had envisioned. The soundtrack came together just as the movie did: working in lockstep and feeding into one another.
“[Gerwig] had a vision for a really diverse and unique world that she was creating,” Brandon Davis, executive VP and co-head of pop A&R at Atlantic, explains. “That’s why you’re hearing, for instance, a Karol G record that leans more reggaeton next to a Dominic Fike record that’s a nod to Sugar Ray.”
As Barbie was being edited, Ronson and Gerwig got into the habit of showing scenes from the film to a new artist on their wish list each week.
“Everybody would watch the scene and come back a week or two weeks later, and got exactly to the heart of everything we were trying to do,” Ronson says.
One of his first calls was to his friend Charli XCX, a huge Barbie fan who says her “first live performance” was an a cappella rendition of Aqua’s “Barbie Girl” when she was four years old, for a cruise-ship talent show. (She ended up winning.)
“My parents were like, ‘Oh, my God. No.’ They were really worried that I was going to get up on the stage and cry, and it would be a disaster,” she explains. “But I was adamant that I wanted to do it. I just sang it on the microphone with new music — the whole song — and I won the contest.”
Ronson and Gerwig gave Charli XCX a few scenes to pick from, but pop’s foremost lover of car anthems was hooked on the chase scene, and ended up penning “Speed Drive.”

“I’ve always really liked singing about cars,” she says. “For me, there is this intrinsic link between driving and music and feeling like you’re a star when you’re in a car.”
She wanted “Speed Drive,” where she flips Toni Basil’s “Mickey” for the chorus, to “feel quite bratty” and “about just being hot.”
As for the aforementioned Aqua song, fans were outraged when the Danish group told the press last year that their 1997 pop hit would not be featured in the film. Even though it wasn’t in the script, Gerwig’s plan all along was to find a place for it, especially since Robbie and others were begging for it.
“I was like, ‘Greta, how are we going to incorporate this song? We can’t do a Barbie movie and not have a nod to Aqua’s ‘Barbie Girl.’ It has to be in there.’ And [Greta] was like, ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to find a cool way to incorporate it,’ ” recalls Robbie.
Robbie continues: “And then, when she was like, ‘Guess who’s going to do the remix of Aqua’s “Barbie Girl”? Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice.’ I was like, ‘Together? Are you joking?!’ I just knew immediately that all my girlfriends were going to lose their minds.”
For Ronson the music maestro, getting the queen of the Barbz to rap over an extended version of “Barbie Girl” seemed like a no-brainer.
“I feel like people have been asking Nicki to rhyme over some version of ‘Barbie Girl’ for 15 years now,” Ronson says.
As for Ice Spice, it was almost impossible to pin down the extremely in-demand rapper. She was due at the studio earlier in the day to lay down her verses but couldn’t make it until after midnight. Ronson, who was already getting ready for bed “like an old guy,” ended up biking back to the studio in the middle of the night to make it happen.

Karol G also made sure to carve out time in a crazy year to make the “wild and raucous” track “Watati.” She was the musical guest on SNL merely six hours after sitting in Ronson’s studio watching scenes from Barbie. PinkPantheress may not have owned any Barbies as a kid (“Only because my mom didn’t get them for me,” she shares), but she studied Gerwig’s filmography when she was in school, since she dreamed of becoming an actress prior to pursuing music. She was thrilled at the prospect of working with the director, which inspired the sound of the wistful “Angel.”
Having now spent the better part of a year in Barbie’s world, Ronson still isn’t ready to leave. “This movie is so insanely good-looking and visually captivating,” he says. “You could just pause on the most random shot anywhere in this film and stare at it like it was a painting in the Louvre for an hour because there’s a thousand shades of pink.”
When he began the endeavor, Ronson bought an assortment of Barbies from Toys R Us and placed them around his studio (as well as some Kens that Mattel had to send him because he couldn’t find them in stores anywhere). As his work on the film was ending, he became a first-time dad to a baby girl.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL3R2LW1vdmllcy90di1tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9iYXJiaWUtc291bmR0cmFjay1tYXJrLXJvbnNvbi1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLWdyZXRhLWdlcndpZy1kdWEtbGlwYS1uaWNraS1taW5hai0xMjM0Nzc1MDY3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-11 14:34:41+00:00,Gal Gadot Says Being Margot Robbie’s First Choice for Barbie ‘Warmed My Heart’: ‘I Was Very Touched’,"Gal Gadot is honored to have been Margot Robbie's ideal Barbie for the ""Barbie"" movie.","Given the $1 billion success of “Barbie,” it’s hard to picture anyone in the title role other than Margot Robbie. But the actor explained to Vogue back in May that it was actually Gal Gadot who was her first choice to star as Barbie. Robbie is a producer on “Barbie” and did not immediately envision herself in the role. Gadot was at the top of her list, but scheduling conflicts prevented the “Wonder Woman” star from entering Barbieland.
“I adore Margot,” Gadot now tells Flaunt magazine about being the top choice for the “Barbie” movie. “Margot is one of those women who you just want to be friends with. She is so funny, warm, fun and smart and obviously so talented. She brings so much to the table. I would love to do anything with Margot and was very touched [by her comments]. She warmed my heart with everything that she said about me. I’m super excited for them, and I’m so excited for ‘Barbie.’”
Although Gadot could not star in “Barbie,” her entire persona became a calling card for the film’s casting directors as they set out with Robbie to find the perfect Barbie actors.
“Gal Gadot is Barbie energy,” Robbie told Vogue. “Because Gal Gadot is so impossibly beautiful, but you don’t hate her for being that beautiful because she’s so genuinely sincere, and she’s so enthusiastically kind, that it’s almost dorky. It’s like right before being a dork.”
Gadot is far from the only actor whose name circled the “Barbie” movie. The film’s casting directors revealed last month that “Saturday Night Live” Emmy nominee Bowen Yang, “Schitt’s Creek” Emmy winner Dan Levy and “Dear Evan Hansen” Tony winner Ben Platt were all in the running to play version of Ken in the film but scheduling logistics prevented the castings from happening. Jonathan Groff also circled the role of Ken’s long-suffering friend Allan before Michael Cera landed the part.
“Barbie” director Greta Gerwig told CinemaBlend before the film opened in theaters that she also tried and failed to get her “Lady Bird” and “Little Women” stars Saorise Ronan and Timothée Chalamet to cameo in the film.
“It was going to be a specialty cameo,” Gerwig said. “I was also going to do a specialty cameo with Timmy. Both of them couldn’t do it and I was so annoyed. But I love them so much. But it felt like doing something without my children. I mean, I’m not their mom, but I sort of feel like their mom.”
“Barbie” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Warner Bros.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvZ2FsLWdhZG90LWJhcmJpZS1maXJzdC1jaG9pY2UtbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS0xMjM1Njk0MTI4L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvZ2FsLWdhZG90LWJhcmJpZS1maXJzdC1jaG9pY2UtbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS0xMjM1Njk0MTI4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-19 13:00:04+00:00,Opinion | Margot Robbie’s Sly Interpretation of the Feminine Ideal,"In “Barbie,” “Bombshell” and “I, Tonya,” the actress subverts expectations.","I saw “Barbie” the day after it premiered. You probably do not need another “Barbie” take after nearly every pundit in America has already taken a whack, but I am still thinking about the movie nearly a month later. In particular, I continue to marvel at the performance of Margot Robbie, who played the titular heroine — Stereotypical Barbie — and who I think isn’t getting enough credit for holding the movie together.
For the three of you who haven’t seen the movie yet, here’s a rough outline of the plot: Stereotypical Barbie has an existential crisis in women-run Barbie Land when her body becomes less than flawless — a spot of cellulite here, an unarched foot there. She must journey to the real world, leaving an army of other Barbies behind, to get back to a state of unquestioning bliss. She grudgingly takes Ken (a perfectly doltish Ryan Gosling) with her, and in the real world he discovers the concept of patriarchy. Ken returns to Barbie Land before her and stages a coup, overthrowing the matriarchy and installing a band of “doofi” in their place. Some dance battles, terrible crooning and rousing feminist speeches ensue, and ultimately, Barbie triumphs (how could she not?), while also choosing beautifully messy reality over plastic perfection.
Despite the pro-Barbie message, I had the same reaction as The Times’s chief film critic, Manohla Dargis, who praised Robbie’s performance as “charming and subtly phased,” while acknowledging that she is upstaged by Ken’s “comic obtuseness and arc.” (My 7-year-old daughter still wants Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House.) At first, when I left the theater, it irked me that Robbie and her band of Barbies — with the possible exception of exiled Weird Barbie, who doesn’t fit the mold (Kate McKinnon) — didn’t get to have as much fun as any of the Kens or Allan (a hilariously disgruntled Michael Cera, who plays the only male doll not named Ken). A movie called “Barbie,” and Barbie didn’t always feel like the main character.
But after reflection, I wondered if that was an intentional commentary on what it means to be a woman — doing the necessary and unsung labor of plot exposition while the men in the film get to be Mr. Fun Dad. I also kept thinking about Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie. Her movements were always precise and embodied — it’s not easy to play plastic. But crucially, it was quietly moving to watch the dawning realization of mortality, human cruelty and prejudice register on her luminous face.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTkvb3Bpbmlvbi9tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLWJhcmJpZS1mZW1pbmluZS1pZGVhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 16:20:00+00:00,‘Barbie’ Dream Noms: Ryan Gosling for Best Supporting Actor,"Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie could make it to the Oscars for Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie.""","There’s a moment in “Barbie” where Ryan Gosling, who plays the wickedly funny and insecure manchild, Ken, steps off the screen and yells, “Sublime!” It might be the most extraordinary Oscar-worthy clip of a person not to be seen on screen.
“Barbie,” the new meta-comedy from Warner Bros, which also acts as an infomercial for Mattel, finally lands for audiences and could be one of the leading comedy films seeking Oscar recognition by year’s end if Academy members can take it seriously. Gosling’s iconic turn, at least, is worthy of best supporting actor recognition.
Commercial comedies, particularly those without the added “dramedy” sub-qualifier, have faced difficulty landing Academy recognition for decades (i.e., Vince Vaughn in “Wedding Crashers”). However, a promising trend has been seen in the last few years with acting nominees like Robert Downey Jr in “Tropic Thunder” (2008), Melissa McCarthy in “Bridesmaids” (2011) and Maria Bakalova in “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” (2020) landing comfortably in their respective fields. Gosling could join the ranks.
Gosling, 42, is a respected actor in the industry with two nominations under his belt — one as the drug-addicted teacher in “Half Nelson” (2006) and the other as the passionate jazz player in “La La Land” (2016). He may not be the first name you think of when discussing brilliant comedic actors, but he’s displayed his funny chops in films such as Shane Black’s “The Nice Guys” (2016) opposite Russell Crowe. With abs and a fur coat, Gosling is the film’s MVP.
When it comes to the film’s overall chances, it will all rest on sustainability through the season. While the reviews are strong (sitting at 89% on Rotten Tomatoes), it’ll need to show strength through significant guild recognition through the season, such as WGA and PGA, to have any chance of being one of the few populist movies that land in the best picture lineup.
Everett Collection
As the titular character, Margot Robbie is undoubtedly tailor-made for the role she was born to play. With a career that has already landed the Australian performer two Oscar noms herself — “I, Tonya” (2017) and “Bombshell” (2019) — she’ll be a fan favorite throughout the remaining calendar year. However, outside of being a solid contender for a Golden Globe in lead comedy actress, an Oscar slot in best actress might be challenging to attain (she’s also a listed producer, which could help in the best picture). The same goes for America Ferrera, who is wonderful as Gloria, delivering an inspirational speech about women’s roles worldwide that will be used in acting classroom monologues for years. Ferrera also has Sony’s “Dumb Money,” which could put her on Oscar’s radar.
Gerwig’s skillful commentary on feminism and biting humor could create an opportunity for her to land recognition in adapted screenplay. With three previous noms for “Lady Bird” (2017) in directing and original screenplay and “Little Women” (2019) in adapted, she’s a well-regarded scribe and could land, along with her real-life partner Noah Baumbach, in the race.
What’s most needed in the “Barbie” best picture quest is the recognition of its artisans. Production design (Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer) and costumes (Jacqueline Durran) seem like no-brainers no matter the outcome of the rest of the year. But can it add editing by Nick Huoy, an original score mention by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, or an original song for Billie Eilish and Finneas (“What Was I Made For”)? Those answers will be vital to its chances.
The “Barbenheimer” frenzy has linked the two titles in audiences’ minds. Interestingly, with “Oppenheimer” feeling assured of a run for best picture run, that could weirdly help “Barbie” get on those same ballots (as long as the campaigns remain as friendly as they’ve been the past few weeks).

After Tom Cruise took to social media to promote the three most hotly anticipated summer tentpoles outside his own film, Barbie filmmaker Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie returned the favor Thursday night.
On Twitter and Instagram, Robbie and Gerwig posted three images of themselves standing in front of promo posters holding tickets for the Cruise starring Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One as well as James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
The post is simply captioned “Mission: Accepted!” an allusion to Cruise’s earlier post urging fans to go see the big summer movies and also the Mission: Impossible franchise.
In Cruise’s post, the actor and Dead Reckoning director Christopher McQuarrie promoted Indy 5, Oppenheimer and Barbie. Will Mangold and Indy 5 star Harrison Ford, and Oppenheimer‘s Nolan and star Cillian Murphy now follow suit?
The cross-promotion will be a welcome boost to box office returns for Hollywood tentpoles outside of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse underwhelming this summer.
Early tracking suggests Barbie could open to a $70 million to $80 million if not more. Oppenheimer is tracking for a domestic debut in the $40 million range. Despite a mixed critical reception, Indy 5 is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.

By Thomas Curtis-Horsfall
It'll forever be dumbfounding when someone admits they've never listened to The Beatles.
Their music is filtered into the very fabric of popular culture and soundtracked the lives of people around the world for over sixty years.
To this day, The Beatles are still the best-selling music act of all time, proving that their music continues to inspire and influence new generations.
So, to avoid listening to the most commercially successful music phenomenon ever you'd have to be living under a rock.
That, or you'd just have to flat-out refuse to listen to them, which is precisely the stance that Barbie and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star Margot Robbie recently revealed she took.

In an interview earlier this year, Robbie opened up about being very much a heavy metal rocker back in her formative years, and admitted to going through a ""goth phase"".
""I would only listen to heavy metal music, [and] I would die my hair black and only cut it with a razor blade. So yeah, kinda goth"" she told Graham Norton.
But now she's set the record straight, confirming that it was the Beach Boys that sparked her interest in music.
She developed such a fandom of them, that she shunned listening to The Beatles because of their rivalry at the time.

Ahead of the release of the doll-inspired blockbuster Barbie, Margot Robbie talked to Rolling Stone magazine about the music that has shaped her life.
""I had my death-metal phase - and I do still like that - but I also like a lot of music,"" she confirmed.
At the age of five, Robbie developed an obsession with the Beach Boys after discovering a tape cassette her family-owned.
It was ""all [she] would listen to."" She was so devoted to the group that she even refused to listen to The Beatles.
""I had watched a documentary about how the Beach Boys would have been even more popular if The Beatles hadn’t come along and stolen the limelight,"" she explained.
We've no doubt all been prone to a bit of tribalism when it comes to our favourite bands and their rivals.
But Margot Robbie's initial refusal to embrace one of the greatest ever musical acts to grace our ears and move into heavy metal as a teen helped set the groundwork for her eclectic tastes.

She even relies on her varied music taste to help step into the shoes of the characters she plays in movies, making playlists as she prepares for the role.
There's also a further connection with Margot Robbie and the Beach Boys, thanks to Mattel's legendary doll Barbie.
Brian Wilson in fact wrote a song called 'Living Doll (Barbie)' for the California Dream Barbie in 1987.
For the first teaser of the Barbie film released earlier this year, the Beach Boys' song 'Fun, Fun, Fun' was also used in the trailer, though it must've surely been coincidental that Margot was the film's central star.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGRyYWRpb3VrLmNvbS9hcnRpc3RzL3RoZS1iZWF0bGVzL21hcmdvdC1yb2JiaWUtZmF2b3VyaXRlLWJhbmQtYmVhY2gtYm95cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-17 22:07:51+00:00,This Barbie Is Now on Strike,The actors’ strike effectively ended the “Barbie” film’s press tour. But Margot Robbie’s pink-carpet outfits are worth remembering.,"The actors’ strike has hit the brakes on the hot pink convertible that is the “Barbie” film’s press tour.
Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and other stars of Greta Gerwig’s forthcoming movie inspired by the doll are unlikely to appear on pink carpets until further notice in solidarity with SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union. That means the parade of neon fashion led by Ms. Robbie has probably come to an end.
Ms. Robbie, who was styled by Andrew Mukamal, had her pick of designers throughout the press tour, from vintage Versace to Vivienne Westwood. But several of the actress’s best looks took inspiration from Barbie’s clothing archive, including a black-and-white-striped swimsuit the doll wore when it was introduced in 1959, a prim skirt suit from the ’80s and a swirly minidress Barbie wore in the ’90s.
Those outfits, seen here alongside the Barbie clothes that inspired them, struck the exact right balance between kitschy and chic. “It’s not subtle,” Ms. Robbie said in an interview with People, “but it’s very fun!”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMTcvc3R5bGUvbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1iYXJiaWUtcHJlbWllcmUtb3V0Zml0cy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Margot Robbie felt like a life in plastic was just right for her.
So, when it came to casting the role of the titular doll in Barbie, Margot, who also served as a co-producer on the film, stepped up for the role.
""I didn't actually audition for the role of Barbie,"" Margot told Teen Vogue in a video interview published July 24. ""I produced the film, so I guess I cast myself.""
However, Margot explained she made it ""very clear"" to Barbie's director Greta Gerwig that the filmmaker had creative control over who would land the role.

Thanks to the highly anticipated Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie movie, landing in theaters on July 21, Barbie-mania has infiltrated everything from makeup to manicures. Like most recent trends inspired by the iconic Mattel character, Barbiecore nails revolve around all things pink and glamorous.
“The Barbiecore Nail trend is all about shades of baby pink and bright pink — the brighter, the better — along with super feminine details like bows, pearls and Barbie’s go-to: sparkle and bubble-gum pink aesthetic,” celebrity nail artist Julie Kandalec tells PEOPLE. “Barbie lives her dream life in her dream home, and the nail trends are just that — whimsical, girly, dreamy nails.”
To create your very own Barbiecore manicure at home, Kandalec points to shades like Lights Lacquer’s Girl from Ipanema (a shimmering pink with a jelly finish), Chanel’s Diva (a vibrant pink) and CND’s Be Demure (a bubblegum pink).
Margot Robbie, who portrays Barbie in the upcoming film alongside Ryan Gosling as Ken, has been channeling some of the doll’s most memorable style moments throughout the press tour.

Margot Robbie fully embraced her role as ""Barbie"" — even in the gym.
David Higgins, Robbie's longtime trainer, recently spoke with Insider about what it was like to train the ""Barbie"" cast. And he was happy to share some of his favorite behind-the-scenes memories.
That included the day he saw Robbie kick off her heels and do a full Pilates workout in her ""Barbie"" hair, makeup, and costume.

""She just needed to move, and that's the beauty of Margot,"" he added. ""She knows her body so well. She knows what she needs to do and will sneak it in when she can. I was talking to her as she's doing whatever she's doing on the Reformer and I was like, 'This is crazy.'""
Higgins, who is also the author of ""The Hollywood Body Plan,"" said he still regrets that he didn't take a photo of the moment, although he did snap a picture after Robbie beat the ""Barbie"" cast at a plank challenge.
While Higgins took the top spot with a plank that lasted five minutes and 32 seconds, Robbie wasn't far behind after holding her plank for four minutes and 10 seconds.
She beat out costars Ryan Gosling (three minutes and two seconds), Hari Nef (two minutes and 15 seconds), and her husband Tom Ackerley, who clocked in at one minute and 36 seconds.

The ""Barbie"" cast worked out together during filming, and Higgins said the atmosphere in the gym was always full of laughs — which was different from the superhero movies he's worked on, including ""The Batman.""

""What was fun about the 'Barbie' movie was, because of the subject matter, it sort of promoted a sense of fun and a sense of levity that other films might not have,"" he said. ""Like 'Batman,' for example, Batman's quite a dark character and that kind of translates into other areas of the film as well, and that was quite an interesting experience. Having Barbie be so pink, it really infiltrated every aspect and every area of the film.""
Robbie stayed committed to her role as Barbie throughout filming, implementing mandatory pink days on set, drinking cups of special tea to keep her skin glowing, and doing four days of Pilates per week with Higgins.

2023-08-04 21:23:07+00:00,Why Does Margot Robbie Wear a Yellow Dress at the End of ‘Barbie’?,Costume designer Jacqueline Durran explains why Margot Robbie's Barbie wears a yellow dress at the end.,"SPOILER ALERT: This contains spoilers from “Barbie” which is now playing in theaters.
The yellow dress Margot Robbie’s wears in Barbie’s final scenes was designed to represent change, says the film’s costume designer Jacqueline Durran.
By the end of the Greta Gerwig blockbuster, Barbie has been transformed by the Real World. She’s become flat-footed, broken the patriarchy and all zen has been restored in Barbieland. Except Barbie, after experiencing the spectrum of human emotion, is feeling unfulfilled. She wants to be a human in the real world.
“The Barbies have gone through all of that stuff and they’re now the most fulfilled versions of themselves,” Durran says. “And that sets the scene for what’s happening to Margot’s Barbie as she’s becoming human.”
Durran says the costumes in Barbieland did not accentuate the softness of a human body. However, for the yellow dress Robbie wears in the end scene, “the costume is a bias cut dress which drapes — it’s not Barbie quality.”
The color also contrasts the pink-heavy world of the movie. “I was keen to track the history of Mattel in the costumes,” Durran says. “I asked them what was the most popular costume in the last 5 to 10 years. It turns out it’s a yellow dress. I was going to copy that dress, but it wouldn’t really be recognizable enough.” So she took the yellow idea and applied it to a drape cut.
Like many of the pieces in the film, Durran made the dress. “We wanted a soft yellow and wanted it to have less pop. So, we printed that yellow onto white silk, and because of the cut, it clings to the body. That’s not really a Barbie characteristic — the Barbie characteristic is to be cut straight and to create a shape that falls away from the body.”
Steering farther away from the looks of Barbieland, Durran used a wedge instead of a traditional heel. “We moved from the classic Barbie heeled court shoe into something softer, but at the same time we had to keep the heel.”
As for Barbie’s heart locket, “There’s a source of pathos in a locket that Barbie doesn’t necessarily have,” Durran says. “So, earlier in the film, she has heart accessories that she wears in the block party, and she has huge heart earrings, but there’s something about that locket and scale that makes it more human.”
And what about that cameo by Oscar-winning costume designer Ann Roth? Did Durran dress her?
“Absolutely not,” she says. “I contacted Ann through email and I said, ‘Just wear whatever you want. You’re appearing as yourself.’ She wanted to know about the scene, so I reiterated the positioning of the scene and the color Margot would be wearing.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXllbGxvdy1kcmVzcy0xMjM1Njg4MjE1L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLXllbGxvdy1kcmVzcy0xMjM1Njg4MjE1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-07 22:47:37+00:00,Michael Cera Says He Wasn’t in ‘Barbie’ Group Chat Because He Has a Flip Phone,"In a recent interview, Michael Cera shared that he wasn't included in the 'Barbie' cast group chat because he has a flip phone.","It only makes sense that all the Barbies and Kens from Greta Gerwig‘s upcoming film were in a group chat together, but one Ken said he missed out on all the text message shenanigans.
During a recent interview for People‘s Barbie special issue, Simu Liu revealed that since Margot Robbie hosted a sleepover for all the Barbies, all the Kens decided to start a group chat with them to “show our support but not be overbearing with our presence.”
But Michael Cera said he got omitted from the conversation because “I don’t have an iPhone myself. … I have a flip phone.” Cera noted that he was fine with it though, adding, “I still think I wouldn’t belong on [the group chat] anyway, because [my character] Allan is sort of in his own little world.”
This isn’t the first time the Superbad actor has been open about his dislike of modern technology. He told The Hollywood Reporter during an interview in February that he was not interested in having social media or a smartphone.
“That is a conscious choice, because I feel a bit of fear about it honestly like I’d really lose control of my waking life,” he said at the time. “Right when people started having smartphones, when it was Blackberries, I had lunch with a friend of mine who was my best friend at the time, and he’d just gotten a Blackberry, and for the whole meal he was typing emails, and I was sat there lonely and bored. So I had an early aversion to them.”
As for the Barbie cast, texting in a group chat wasn’t the only thing they did all together while filming. Ryan Gosling also revealed that Robbie initiated a mandatory pink dress code on set once a week.
“Margot had this pink day once a week, where everyone had to wear something pink. And if you didn’t, you were fined,” he explained. “She would go around collecting the fines, and she would donate it to a charity.”
Gosling noted that not only did the cast have fun with it, but that it was “really special” to see the male crew members get excited as well.
“At the end of the film, they all got together and, with their own money, made pink crew shirts with rainbow fringe,” he said. “It was this opportunity for them to show their respect and admiration for what Margot and [director] Greta [Gerwig] were creating. It was almost like that scene at the end of Dead Poets Society, where they all get on their desk and say, ‘O captain! My captain!'”
It’s safe to say all the Barbies, Kens and crew members had a filming set filled with lots of laughter. Robbie even said she ruined several of Gosling’s takes because she was “laughing through all of it.”
“Ryan is the most comedically gifted actor I have ever worked with. He really is,” Robbie added. “He’s known for his dramatic acting, and rightly so. But he is unbelievably gifted with comedy.”
Barbie, also starring Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and more, hits theaters July 21.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taWNoYWVsLWNlcmEtYmFyYmllLWdyb3VwLWNoYXQtZmxpcC1waG9uZS0xMjM1NTMxMjk4L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taWNoYWVsLWNlcmEtYmFyYmllLWdyb3VwLWNoYXQtZmxpcC1waG9uZS0xMjM1NTMxMjk4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Oscar-Winning Costume Designer Ann Roth Shares a Brief — but Impactful — Moment with Margot Robbie in 'Barbie','Barbie' director and co-writer Greta Gerwig revealed why Anne Roth's scene was a focal point in the film,"The Barbie film has an iconic cast, through and through.
But while everyone's familiar with the big names of the cast, there's one name that some moviegoers might not have been familiar with — and they may not even be familiar with her face. They'll definitely know her work though.
That person is Oscar-winning costume designer Ann Roth.
Roth is featured in the first trailer for Barbie and shares the cutest (and also funniest) scene with star Margot Robbie. While Robbie is having a bit of a tough moment, she encounters Roth on a bench, looks at her and tells her she's beautiful. Without batting an eye, Roth tells her that she knows, and the two of them laugh.
In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, director and co-writer Greta Gerwig discussed Roth's cameo in her film.
""I love that scene so much,” said Gerwig, adding that Roth is a “legend.”
Further breaking down the scene, Gerwig continued: “It’s a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way — it doesn’t lead anywhere. And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, ‘Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.’ And I said, ‘If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about.’""
The tug-at-your-heart-strings bit, to Gerwig, is “the heart of the movie. The way Margot plays that moment is so gentle and so unforced.”
Roth, 91, has more than 100 credits to her name and has been nominated for five academy awards for her costume work. She's won two — for The English Patient and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
She's also notably worked with Gerwig's partner, Noah Baumbach, on three projects: Margot at the Wedding, While We're Young and White Noise. She's worked across movies, TV and theater and also took home a Tony Award in 2013 for The Nance.

In an exclusive interview with PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue (out now) alongside Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more, Gerwig couldn't help but be nostalgic about being in Barbie world.
""There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,"" Gerwig said. ""I want to go back to Barbie Land.""
She may or may not have to wait for long for her return. Gerwig added that she hopes the movie, in theaters Friday July 21, ""is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.""

What’s already proved to be worth the hype surrounding the film is the pink fashions, which were glimpsed at the height of the Barbie press tour.

Whether she was quite literally stealing the carpet dressed up as the ‘60s Solo in the Spotlight figurine or channeling the 1992 Totally Hair Barbie in disco glam, the actress was all for bringing the Mattel icon to life even further.
“We're finding Barbie references from decades past and just doing it really for the big Barbie fans out there, people who are actually collecting those Barbies. We're hoping to get them excited,” Robbie told PEOPLE exclusively at the Barbie world premiere.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS93aG8taXMtYW5uLXJvdGgtYmFyYmllLWNhbWVvLW9zY2FyLXdpbm5pbmctY29zdHVtZS1kZXNpZ25lci03NTYzNTk50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 13:41:00+00:00,Who Is Margot Robbie's Husband Tom Ackerley?,Get to know the Barbie star's husband.,"As Barbie finally hits theaters this weekend, star Margot Robbie is in the spotlight for her performance as the titular doll. But who is her real-life Ken?
Robbie, who is very private, quietly tied the knot to producer Tom Ackerley in 2016, after they dated for three years. Now, the two run a production company together—and the latest film they produced is none other than Barbie.
""I'm always nervous to start any job. I have this complete crisis of faith and think, 'Oh my gosh, I'm not even good at acting and I can't do this,'"" Robbie told the Daily Mirror about Ackerley in 2021. ""Every time I do a movie, I turn to my husband and I'm like, 'I don't think I can do this'. He says something like, 'You do this every time. You'll be fine.' ""
Here's everything you need to know about Margot Robbie's husband Tom Ackerley:
He's a British film producer.

Ackerley, who was raised in Guildford, Surrey and attended Godalming College, works as a producer. ""I seem to love a lot of British things,"" Robbie joked to The Mirror in 2021. ""I love Harry Potter, I love my husband and I love Love Island. It’s great.""
In addition to Barbie, he has produced Promising Young Woman, Maid, and I, Tonya, among other projects.
Robbie and Ackerley met in 2013.

They met on the set of Suite Française; she was an actress in the film and he was an assistant director. They started dating a year later. ""I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit,"" Robbie later said. ""And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, Of course we're together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.""
The same year they started dating, they created production company LuckyChap Entertainment alongside friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. ""I’m a great advocate of doing business with your partner,"" Robbie Porter in 2018. ""Being married is actually the most fun ever, life got way more fun somehow. I have a responsibility being someone’s wife, I want to be better.""
They got engaged and married in secret.

The private couple tied the knot in December 2016 in Australia. After, instead of going on a honeymoon, they went to work on I, Tonya—and took their delayed honeymoon to Tahiti after shooting wrapped. ""We did [I, Tonya] instead of our honeymoon. There were times we were sitting in a car parked in Atlanta freezing cold being like, 'We should be on a beach right now. We should be on a honeymoon. What are we doing?!' Following our dream,"" Robbie told Extra in 2017.
He was an extra in third Harry Potter movies.
""My husband is in the Harry Potter movies. I know, I was like, 'Had you told me sooner we would've been married very quickly,'"" Robbie, a major Potter fan, said in 2020. ""But he was an extra when he was a little kid — he was one of the Slytherin extras when Draco pushes some kids out of the way to see Buckbeak in the third book. He pushes my husband out of the way.""
He's on Instagram, but rarely posts.
Robbie has no social media accounts, but Ackerley has an Instagram, @alpha_meows. Robbie sometimes appears, like in this slideshow of photos from their trip to Lapland (swipe through):
As of this writing, however, he hasn't posted since March 2021.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9sZWlzdXJlL2FydHMtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvYTQ0NTkwMTI3L3doby1pcy10b20tYWNrZXJsZXktbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1odXNiYW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

In one of the final scenes of Barbie, Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie is grappling with a choice: to stay in Barbieland or become a real human.
She decides to leave—while wearing a custom pale yellow dress that has a deeper meaning. The dress Barbie wears is meant to represent change, Barbie's costume designer Jacqueline Durran explains. ""The Barbies have gone through all of that stuff and they’re now the most fulfilled versions of themselves,"" Durran tells Variety. ""And that sets the scene for what’s happening to Margot’s Barbie as she’s becoming human.""

Here's how internet reacted to his remark. | Hollywood","Elon Musk has mocked the box office hit Barbie on Twitter, now called X.

Many on X reacted to Elon's statement. While some agreed that the Barbie movie was political, others praised it for being 'a feminist movie'. A person said, ""Elon Musk slams Barbie over it’s unceasing anti-male messaging."" Another one agreed with Elon, saying, ""Hahahahaha. Well, it is called Barbie, the movie is made to please girls, not us.""
However, Elon's reaction to Barbie generated plenty of mocking of its own. A person joked, ""You’re a lightweight."" One more said, ""Ken says it more than anyone else. I don’t think Barbie says the word at all actually."" Another one said, ""We gotta do something about this guy. I'm so serious."" A person also said, ""Cry harder...""
Elon Musk on Oppenheimer
Elon had recently shared his opinion on Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, saying that the movie was too long. Elon had agreed and responded to Samuel Harris Altman, the CEO of OpenAI's remark on X with 'indeed'.
Samuel had said, “I was hoping that the Oppenheimer movie would inspire a generation of kids to be physicists but it really missed the mark on that. Let’s get that movie made! (I think The Social Network managed to do this for startup founders).""
On Sunday, Elon Musk had also shared a picture of a packed theatre, where some could be seen scrolling on their phones as Oppenheimer played in front of them. The caption of the photo read, “This Oppenheimer movie is way too long.”
About Barbie
The Margot Robbie-starrer has become the US and Canada's biggest film of the year so far. It grossed $337 million worldwide in its opening weekend, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter. Barbie tells a coming-of-age story of the iconic doll, where she explores her identity and encourages friend Ken to establish his individuality.
It was released on Friday along with Oppenheimer, and the competition between them both was referred to on social media as Barbenheimer. Directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is centred on the development of the first atomic bomb. It features Cillian Murphy in lead role.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2QvZWxvbi1tdXNrLW1vY2tzLWJhcmJpZS1wYXJ0cmlhcmNoeS1mZW1pbmlzdC1maWxtLXBvbGl0aWNhbC0xMDE2OTAzNTk0OTI1NjYuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ob2xseXdvb2QvZWxvbi1tdXNrLW1vY2tzLWJhcmJpZS1wYXJ0cmlhcmNoeS1mZW1pbmlzdC1maWxtLXBvbGl0aWNhbC0xMDE2OTAzNTk0OTI1NjYtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-17 11:46:00+00:00,Chris Taylor on how afterparty with Margot Robbie led to Barbie role,After his cameo in the upcoming Barbie film was confirmed Chris Taylor reveals how he landed the role and what it was like on set.,"Yes, it's really happening. One of the most iconic Islanders from Love Island season five, Chris Taylor, has a cameo in the upcoming Barbie film. And no, he can't believe it either.
Speaking to Cosmopolitan UK ahead of Barbie's release this week (21st July), Chris revealed how an afterparty he nearly didn't attend led to him being cast in Barbie. Chris revealed he was introduced to Margot at a Birds of Prey party in 2020, after his housemates and fellow Islanders Michael Griffiths and Jordan Hames met Margot at the premiere.
""The lads had gone to the Birds of Prey premiere, and they came back saying how they'd met Margot on the red carpet, and Margot was gassed to see them,"" Chris said. ""We were sat around talking about it when someone got a message saying Margot wanted us all to come to the afterparty. I was actually in bed, but I said I'd come as how often do you get to met Margot Robbie?""

It was incredibly fortunate Chris did attend, and the subsequent after-afterparty at Margot's hotel with a smaller group of guests, as it led to him having some long chats with Margot about his own life and family and friends.
""She's just really down to earth and cool. She's one of the nicest people I've ever met,"" Chris said.
Chris clearly made an impression, as a year and a half later he got an email from Warner Brothers asking him to audition for a role in Barbie. He ended up getting it, and six months later found himself at Warner Brothers studio for costume fittings.
""I was fully convinced it was a prank,"" Chris said. ""These YouTubers, they're clever, they'll write full on contracts and do the prank video. But I pulled up at Warner Brothers and saw Ryan Gosling walked past my car and I thought 'this definitely isn't a prank'.""

Chris appears in one scene towards the middle of the movie, and on his day of filming, he found himself on set alongside Ryan Gosling, Ncuti Gatwa and Ben Kingsley, who all play different versions of Ken.
""Ncuti Gatwa is the loveliest guy I've ever met in my life,"" Chris said of his co-star. ""I met him when I did my fitting and I was really surprised he knew who I was. He'd watched Love Island and said really nice things, including that I should have won.
""He was just super easy to get on with, made me feel really at home and comfortable, because he knew I'm not an actor and was going to be nervous, so he came over and spoke to me a few times.""
Chris practiced his one scene for weeks, and had help from a dialect coach to help him perfect his American accent. Despite filming his scene over a year ago, Chris only found out on the premiere day last week (12th July) that his scene had made the cut, and described seeing himself on screen as part of the film as an ""out of body experience"".
It appears he needed to have no worries about getting cut as he explained he ran into Margot Robbie's husband, Tom Ackerley, who was a producer on the film at the premiere, who said Margot was insistent on getting Chris in the film.
Chris confirmed the news of his cameo appearance on his Instagram last week, posting pictures of the premiere and captioning the post: ""This WILL sound made up…but I’m in the ACTUAL Barbie Film 🤯 No bloody idea how, but here we are…I’m an actual Ken (I talk a lot of sh**e so swipe for evidence 😂).""
He went onto thank a mystery individual who he called a ""glorious ray of human sunshine"" for making his cameo happen. Three guesses for who this could be? Yep, Chris confirmed to Cosmopolitan UK he was thanking Margot for getting him into the film.
""I know she's got a secret account that follows Love Islanders, so hopefully she would have seen that,"" he said. ""I saw her on the red carpet and I got to say a quick thank you, but I didn't really get a chance to see her after that. So I was basically saying thank you.""
You can see Chris' iconic cameo later this week when Barbie finally arrives in cinemas later this week (not that we've been counting down or anything).

2023-07-20 15:00:00+00:00,"‘This Is Not About Selling Toys’: Mattel Bosses on ‘Barbie’s’ Long Development, Needing a Female Director and More","Mattel CEO, Ynon Kreiz, and head of Mattel Films, Robbie Brenner, discuss the toy company's strategy to break into Hollywood with ""Barbie.""","There’s a lot riding on “Barbie.”
The much-hyped film from Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie stands to be monumental for Mattel, turning the 78-year-old toy company into its own cinematic universe. But if the movie falls short, it could damage the American brand that has only just stabilized after a long period of turmoil.
A decade ago, with the rise of e-commerce and the consequent closing of toy stores, Mattel’s sales were nosediving. A cultural shift in beauty standards, gender norms and representation didn’t help the parent company of the white plastic doll. Then, in 2018, after rapidly cycling through a handful of CEOs, Mattel brought in a new boss with a big vision: Ynon Kreiz, an Israeli-born businessman and former chairman of Fox Kids Europe, wanted to turn the toy company into an IP-driven machine, complete with movies, TV shows, stage productions and theme parks. One of his first initiatives was to launch an in-house film division.
Now, Kreiz’s big-screen dream will finally be put to the test. “Barbie,” the first movie to launch from Mattel Films, hits theaters on July 21. In it, Robbie’s Barbie leaves the utopia of Barbie Land with Ken (played by Ryan Gosling) to enter the real world, where she discovers, among other things, the patriarchy.
“We could have done something that is maybe easier and take a brand that is less complicated and has less of a history to manage,” Kreiz says. “Or we could have done animation rather than live action. But we actually wanted to create something ambitious and unique. And you go basically straight to the top with our key brand.”
Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, with critics calling the film “perfection.” But there are no sure bets. In fact, this summer, the proven IP model has failed at the box office, with blockbusters like Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and DC’s “The Flash” crumbling.
But Barbie is as iconic as it gets. She’s the top-selling doll in the world. (Last year, she drove roughly one-third of Mattel’s $5.2 billion in annual revenue.) And a glitzy and expensive marketing campaign for the film has only added to her luster. #Barbiecore, the term for Barbie-inspired pink fashion, has more than 500 million views on TikTok. And who hasn’t seen the pink-painted bus stops in L.A., the double-decker buses in London, the Barbie-themed group date that aired on ABC’s “The Bachelor” and the real-life beach house in Malibu?
If the $100 million movie is a win, it not only will serve as a proof of Mattel’s potential across the entertainment industry, but also could revolutionize the company’s business model, tapping into content categories that, in some cases, Kreiz says, are actually bigger than the toy industry.
With the film tracking to open this weekend at $95 million to $110 million, it looks like Kreiz’s tinsel town vision could pay off.

Barbie’s road to the big screen has been a long one. Warner Bros. is the third studio to attempt to make a “Barbie” film with Mattel. First, in 2009, the project was set up at Universal. Then it went to Sony, where Amy Schumer was cast as the plastic icon, and then Anne Hathaway. (“Taking this skinny blond white doll and making her into a heroine was a tall order,” Diablo Cody, who worked on one of the failed scripts at Sony, said in a recent interview. In another interview, Schumer said creative differences led her to depart the project, but she expressed her excitement for Gerwig’s “feminist and cool” adaptation.)
When Kreiz took the reins of Mattel in 2018, one of his first orders of business was to regain control of the “Barbie” rights when Sony’s option expired. It was the initial step in his plan to open Mattel’s toy box and invite the town’s agents, networks and studios over for a very lucrative playdate.
Within weeks of joining the company, the CEO met with Robbie. He believed the A-lister was the ideal partner to bring the doll to life, and she was interested in producing a “Barbie” movie through her company, LuckyChap Entertainment. In Kreiz’s mind, without Robbie there was no “Barbie.”
“It was Margot,” Kreiz says. “There was no other option.”
The storyline for a film about Barbie was not obvious — that is, until Robbie suggested Gerwig as a writer-director.
“Before the idea of Greta came up, we went out to a bunch of writers just to hear different ideas, and we heard a bunch of pitches,” says Robbie Brenner, the Oscar-nominated indie producer of “Dallas Buyers Club” who was hired to run Mattel Films. “Some were interesting and different and outside of the box and weird and what you would expect and terrible. I mean, the whole gamut. But there was nothing that ever felt like it was worth making a movie about until this idea of Greta directing the movie.”
Brenner says that Mattel made a commitment to put filmmakers first — ahead of toys — and that’s what will keep top-tier talent like Robbie and Gerwig coming its way. “Telling good stories is telling good stories,” she says, “no matter if you’re making independent movies or huge $100 million movies. It’s all about the script, story, cast and the filmmakers — it’s just doing it on a bigger scale.”
When asked if “Barbie” could have been helmed by a man, Brenner says, “I think we felt pretty strongly that it needed to be told from a woman’s point of view. Not to say that a man can’t do it. But I think for ‘Barbie,’ this is the ultimate female-empowerment movie. It’s in the DNA of the movie. I think we all felt like it should be a female.”
At Mattel headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., Mattel Films boss Robbie Brenner poses in front of artwork made up of 164 pairs of Barbie’s tiny plastic shoes. Mattel, Inc.
Gerwig wanted to write the script with her partner, Noah Baumbach. And even though the movie is based on one of Mattel’s most-prized products, Brenner and Kreiz say they were committed to not meddling with what the filmmakers were doing. “It’s not about oversight. It’s not about control. It’s about trust and how we work with creators,” Kreiz says.
“The risk was that people outside of Mattel would think that we want to make movies in order to sell more toys,” he adds, thinking back to his first conversation with Robbie. “And I was very clear that this is not about selling toys. This is about creating quality content, creating an experience with societal impact that people would want to watch. We’ve been selling toys before we made movies, so we’re not dependent on that.”
Still, when Gerwig’s initial script came in, eyebrows were raised inside Mattel.
“When everybody read the script here for the first time, I’m sure there were things that were like, ‘Wow, that sort of pushes things a little bit,’” Brenner says. “But we all decided there were going to be moments where it might feel a little scary, but we’re going to be rewarded for that. Being safe in this world doesn’t work. We want it to be bold. Barbie is bold. She’s done incredible things. She’s a trailblazer. And that’s what we did.”
“I will say,” Brenner adds, “The first script I read that Greta and Noah wrote is very similar to the movie that actually is on the screen.”
Indeed, the movie doesn’t shy away from criticism of the company. One character, played by Will Ferrell, is a Mattel CEO who represents corporate America. Kreiz laughs when he talks about being portrayed by the actor. “I’m a big fan of Will, ever since the ‘Zoolander’ days,” he says. “There are so many elements of humor and self-deprecation in the movie. And we embrace that. We take our brands very seriously. We take what we do very seriously. But we don’t take ourselves
too seriously.”
No matter how many times Mattel executives say they’re not making films to sell toys, they do have to sell toys. The hope is that with the birth of the movie division, Mattel’s products and films will amplify each other, so the entire business skyrockets. It’s a proven model: Hasbro kicked off the toy blockbuster trend in 2007 when it turned its Transformers toys into a multibillion-dollar film franchise with Paramount. And Warner Bros.’ 2014 “The Lego Movie” made more than $450 million and spawned two sequels.
The plan is already working. Ahead of the release of “Barbie,” Mattel has put out a line of movie-specific dolls inspired by Robbie, Gosling, Issa Rae, America Ferrera and Simu Liu’s characters. Robbie’s Barbie instantly became the top-selling doll on Amazon.
The company has dozens of films in the works — 14 projects are in active development or pre-production with big names like J.J. Abrams (“Hot Wheels”), Lena Dunham (“Polly Pocket”), Vin Diesel (“Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots”) and Tom Hanks (“Major Matt Mason”) — but Brenner and Kreiz aren’t sure which will go into production next. This week, Variety reported that Mattel is shopping for a new buyer for “Masters of the Universe,” after Netflix dropped the film that is based on beloved characters like the superhero He-Man, that had been in development at the streamer. For now, Mattel is focused on making “Barbie” a success.
“‘Barbie’ is a showcase for how we work with creative people, but also whether our brands can translate to success on-screen. Because that can also be debated,” Kreiz says. “Not every toy can become a successful movie.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLW1vdmllLW1hdHRlbGwtZXhlY3MtdG95LWFkYXB0YXRpb25zLTEyMzU2NzQ1OTcv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtbWF0dGVsbC1leGVjcy10b3ktYWRhcHRhdGlvbnMtMTIzNTY3NDU5Ny9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Kate McKinnon called Margot Robbie a Barbie in Bombshell,Kate McKinnon predicted Margot Robbie's Barbie role when they starred together in 'Bombshell.',"Before Margot Robbie and Kate McKinnon were Barbies, they were Fox News employees who helped expose TV executive and Fox News chairman Roger Ailes' sexual harassment scandal.
The two played close work friends Kayla Pospisil and Jess Carr with a queer subplot in the 2019 drama Bombshell, centered on the real-life efforts of broadcast journalists Megyn Kelly (played by Charlize Theron) and Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) to bring to light Ailes' (John Lithgow) predatory behavior and the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the network. As it turns out, McKinnon's Carr may have manifested Robbie's Barbie role in the upcoming flick from director Greta Gerwig, out July 21.
Robbie, also a producer on Barbie, reminded viewers as much in a conversation with Fandango published earlier this week. ""Do you know what's so funny? Kate McKinnon and I worked together on Bombshell, and in one take in Bombshell — which actually made the cut in the movie — my character's been revamped because she's [just done] her first on-camera thing, and I come out and she goes, 'Wow, Anchor Barbie.' It's in the movie.""
The revelation came after the interviewer asked whether Robbie or costar Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, have been referred to their dolls in the past. ""I don't think I've ever [been called] Ken,"" Gosling said, noting to Robbie, ""I don't think anyone ever saw this but you and Greta. I get Bryan a lot. But never Ken.""
""Bryan?"" Robbie asked in disbelief.
""Yeah,"" he said.
""Oh, as in people getting your name wrong,"" Robbie clarified, prompting an affirmative from Gosling.

McKinnon plays the delightfully eccentric Weird Barbie in Gerwig's Barbie, which features various versions of Barbies and Kens, also played by the likes of Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Alexandra Shipp, Dua Lipa, and Hari Nef. The film follows Robbie's Barbie as she experiences a full-on existential crisis, leading her to seek counsel from Weird Barbie, who informs her that she must travel to the real world to discover the truth about the universe.
Robbie and Gerwig recently spoke on the joys of creating a handcrafted set that felt like being in a toy box in EW's Around the Table with the cast (above), conducted prior to the actors' strike. ""It's like they were finally flexing these amazing muscles they have,"" Robbie says of the crew. ""They're like, 'Oh, we can do so many things on this movie, whether building life-sized dreamhouses or hand painting mountains on a backdrop.'""
""Everybody who works on a movie on some level is the kid making something strange on the playground [and is] like, 'I made this!'"" Gerwig adds. The crew ""all got to be that kid,"" she says, ""Like, 'Look at what I did!'""
Barbie and her pink convertible cruise into theaters July 21.

Most moviegoers heading into “Barbie” were expecting Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to have the film’s most iconic moments, but that title might actually belong to co-star America Ferrera. As Gloria, a Mattel executive who helps Barbie land back on her feet, the Emmy-winning actor gets one of the film’s centerpiece scenes: an impassioned monologue about the double standards women face on a daily basis.
“We shot it over two days,” Ferrera revealed in a new interview with Vanity Fair. “It’s one part of a much bigger scene with lots of characters in it. I had to do it many, many times for other people’s coverage and to get through the whole scene and over the course of two days.”
Ferrera praised director Greta Gerwig, who also co-wrote “Barbie” with Noah Baumbach, for giving her “so much freedom” with the monologue. The speech even changed shape during filming, with Gerwig and Ferrera jointly adding a section where Gloria rails against women always having to appear grateful.
“There were moments in shooting the movie where Greta really had written something in a very specific way that she heard a very specific way in her head with particular cadence in a particular speed or a particular inflection,” Ferrera said. “I thought maybe this would be like that, but it was the opposite. She wanted me to completely make it my own and find it as we did it.”
Ferrera said it felt like she filmed 500 takes of the speech over the two days of filming, adding, “It was probably 30 to 50 full runs of it, top to bottom. By the end, [co-star Ariana Greenblatt] recited the monologue to me because she had memorized it because that’s how many times I had said it.”
Gloria’s monologue arrives at a point of crisis for Barbie, played by Robbie. She’s just returned to Barbieland, which has been overtaken by Ken and the patriarchy. Barbie no longer feels perfect, which prompts Gloria to slam a long list of double standards that women face.
“Neither one of us went into it feeling like it’s got to grow and crescendo to this big moment where you burst into tears or you’re laughing so hard you cry,” Ferrera said about perfecting the monologue with Gerwig. “There were no targets to hit. It was much more a moment-to-moment drop in. Truly, every take was very different. There were takes that leaned into anger. There were takes that leaned into laughter. It really did, over the course of filming, find a shape. It was about just staying as present in the moment and just seeing really where the words would take it.”

On Monday Matt and Ginger Gaetz, clad in bubblegum pink, attended a Barbie-themed pre-party celebrating the 2023 Aspen Security Forum. Shortly after, Mrs. Gaetz posted photos of her and her husband at the event, along with her review of the film on Twitter. Gaetz criticizing Barbie for neglecting “to address any notion of faith or family,” and “disappointingly low T” (testosterone) and “beta energy” from Ryan Gosling’s Ken. Given that Ken dolls are infamously metrosexual and lack defined genitalia, it’s unclear what testosterone level Mrs. Gaetz would have found acceptable.
Mrs. Gaetz advised her followers to stick “to getting outfit inspiration and skipping the theater.”

I'd recommend sticking to getting outfit inspiration and skipping the theater. Here's why:

On social media, some conservative users criticized the congressman’s attendance at the event. “The movie where ‘Doctor Barbie’ is played by a Trans actor. Wonder why we can’t win culture wars? Republicans love being included with the rich and famous too much,” wrote Twitter user @just_mindy.
Rep. Gaetz responded by tweeting that “If you let the trans stop you from seeing Margo Robbie……the terrorists win…..”

On Saturday, Gaetz spoke at Turning Point USA’s annual summit, where he declared to the audience that “as one true North for the nature of truth itself: Margot Robbie is not mid. A ten is a ten. Even with common core math.”

During both mentions of Robbie’s looks, Gaetz has also taken the opportunity to bash transgender individuals, which is in direct opposition to the film’s support of inclusivity and diversity. Many of the communities that Barbie celebrates are currently battling legislation aimed at curbing their ability to exist freely in public life, and Gaetz is a prominent voice in their subjugation.

During an interview with Attitude, Robbie said that she and the producers were conscious of representation during casting. “We wanted Barbie Land to feel incredibly inclusive. And we wanted this film to feel like everyone was welcome,” she said. “So, it was so important that, kind of, every person that was, like, coming aboard the party would be able to represent someone else that could be watching this movie.” Trending Hunter Biden Offers to Testify Publicly.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz recently accused the film of containing “Chinese communist propaganda.” The Christian website Movieguide.org, published an article titled “WARNING: Don’t Take Your Daughter to BARBIE,” that accused the film of “pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender character stories.”

Sometimes, life in plastic isn't fantastic.
At least, that's what hair and makeup artist Ivana Primorac realized when it came to creating the beauty looks for Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
""We thought, 'Should they have plastic seams? Should they have plastic skin, plastic hair?'"" Ivana exclusively told E! News about the early stages of the makeup design. ""We didn't like all of those things in the end because Barbies are beautiful in every child's mind. So, once we created that fake image it wasn't beautiful.""
Instead, Ivana focused on enhancing the qualities and features that made the Barbies and Kens unique.
""What's most beautiful,"" she explained, ""is each person being the best they can be. To make them believable, relatable and into dolls, every single Ken and Barbie had to be the best version of themselves.

2023-08-14 21:00:00+00:00,Margot Robbie's Yellow Dress in Barbie Has a Secret Deeper Meaning,Barbie costume designer Jacqueline Durran explains the deeper hidden meaning of Margot Robbie's yellow dress at the end of the movie.,"Warning: Spoilers for Barbie ahead.
Clothing is often chosen with reason in movies, as color and style shifts can tell a greater story about where a character's headspace is beyond the script's words. The wardrobe of Barbie's Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, is no exception to that.
While some outfits she wore pay direct homage to past Barbie doll looks, one of Robbie's simplest outfits in the role, the yellow dress she wore in the film's final Barbieland scenes, had a much deeper significance to it in addition to being a tribute to modern Barbie dolls. The dress' draping, the wedge shoes Robbie wore, and the heart necklace were all chosen very deliberately to convey how Robbie's Barbie had changed by the end of the film, costume designer Jacqueline Durran explained to Variety.
YouTube
Plot-wise at that point, Robbie's Barbie had returned from the real world and succeeded in working with Gloria (America Ferrera) her daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), and the other Barbies to save Barbieland from becoming a permanent patriarchal “Kendom.” But Stereotypical Barbie couldn't go back to just being the doll she was before her adventure. She wanted to be human—a creator of ideas rather than just an idea.
The dress in contrast to the other Barbies’ outfits. YouTube
As Durran put it to Variety, “The Barbies have gone through all of that stuff and they’re now the most fulfilled versions of themselves. And that sets the scene for what’s happening to Margot’s Barbie as she’s becoming human.”
The dress cut tells that story too, as it accentuates the softness of the human body in a way traditional Barbie clothes don't: “The costume is a bias cut dress which drapes—it’s not Barbie quality,” she said. With it being yellow, “I was keen to track the history of Mattel in the costumes. I asked them what was the most popular costume in the last 5 to 10 years. It turns out it’s a yellow dress. I was going to copy that dress, but it wouldn’t really be recognizable enough.”
Durran made Robbie's dress herself: “We wanted a soft yellow and wanted it to have less pop,” she said. “So, we printed that yellow onto white silk, and because of the cut, it clings to the body. That’s not really a Barbie characteristic—the Barbie characteristic is to be cut straight and to create a shape that falls away from the body.”
YouTube
The shoe (a wedge) and jewelry choices (Missoma's heart locket) also add to the symbols of Stereotypical Barbie's shift. For the shoes, “we moved from the classic Barbie heeled court shoe into something softer, but at the same time we had to keep the heel,” Durran said.
And with the necklace, “there’s a source of pathos in a locket that Barbie doesn’t necessarily have. So, earlier in the film, she has heart accessories that she wears in the block party, and she has huge heart earrings, but there’s something about that locket and scale that makes it more human.”

,In the Barbie World: Everything the Margot Robbie Starrer Did Right,,"The live action Barbie movie has definitely restored the summer box office to the (Barbie) pink of its health. Having already earned more than 300 million dollars, the film is slated to become one of the highest earners in Hollywood history. While the success of this fantasy comedy is superficially attributed to its ensemble cast and its impeccable direction, there is so much more to its appeal.
Here goes a list of things that the filmmakers did phenomenally well to make Barbie an endearing and enthralling watch for generations to come.
1) The Album
Produced by Mark Ronson, the soundtrack of the Margot Robbie starrer is full of songs that convey profound emotions in a barbie-esque fashion but still manage to be extremely visceral in their depiction of our quotidian struggles as human beings. With songs ranging from the groovy 'WATATI' sung by Karol G and Aldo Ranks to the highly relatable ' What Was I ​Made For' by Billie Eilish, the Barbie album has something for everyone.
Impressively enough, the line-up of the artists is quite diverse too, and it is certain that listeners across all age groups will be able to find a new favorite from the track list.
2) Strategic Brand Collaborations
From Airbnb to Burger King, from Aldo to Dragon Glassware, the list of brands that have doused their commodities and services in shades of pink popularised only by Barbie does not seem to end. These astute promotional tie-ups not only gave the movie unparalleled visibility but also ensured great profits for the companies that hopped onto the bandwagon.
It is not an exaggeration to say that the greatest blockbuster this year is not the live action Barbie movie itself but its marketing team. Special mention to 'Barbeinheimer' memes, Ryan Gosling's GQ interview titled 'Ken Things Ryan Gosling Can't Live Without' and the Barbie dreamhouse tour by none other than the on-screen Barbie, Margot Robbie herself.
​​​​​​3) The Iconic Costumes
​​​​​The costume department headed by the Academy- award winning designer, Jacqueline Durran, took inspiration from Barbie's outfits over the years to replicate the same looks in the film. This gave the whole movie a nostalgic undertone and was highly instrumental in heightening its allure. Be it the evergreen stripped swimsuit from the 1950s or the skater look from the 1990s, the outfits donned by Margot Robbie in the movie will be remembered for ages to come due to the keen attention to detail that went into making them.
4) The Diverse Movie Cast
The film has garnered appreciation for including actors like Simu Liu (as Ken #2) and ​​​Ritu Arya(as journalist Barbie) as they come from communities that are not showcased enough on-screen . The cast also features Ncuti Gatwa, America Ferrera and Issa Rae alongside other notable actors. Their roles in the movie are seen as stepping stones to better representation of minorities in the mainstream media.
​​​​​​5) Saying it Right
​​​​ Movies with a message, especially ones with a feminist subtext, can be considered ""preachy"" if not done right. Barbie breaks all barriers though and deftly makes pertinent and nuanced points about the subjugation of women, belongingness and loss of innocence. The film does not turn into a sermon at any point in the movie. The Greta Grewig directorial balances wholesomeness, hilarity and profoundness in equal measures, justifying its over the peak popularity.
Barbie, in most respects, is the film of the year due to the team that made it happen. So do not wait any further, buy those movie tickets, grab a popcorn, sit back and relax as the Barbie movie takes you to the Barbie world while never losing its hold on reality.

2023-07-25 16:00:04+00:00,‘Barbie’ goes to the Oscars: How many of the cast will be invited?,"Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera could all reap Oscar nominations for their roles in ""Barbie.""","“Barbie” has become a resounding success for Warner Bros. and director Greta Gerwig. The film grossed $155 million in its opening weekend and received rave reviews from critics hailing the direction, script, design, and, above all, performances.
Margot Robbie leads the cast as the titular main Barbie while Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, and Nicola Coughlan, amongst others, play different variations of Barbie. Ryan Gosling leads the pack of Kens along with Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, and Ncuti Gatwa. Also in the movie are Will Ferrell, Michael Cera, America Ferrera, and Ariana Greenblatt. This has led to some intriguing odds charts for the movie on our site, meaning that the “Barbie” cast could theoretically receive up to five Oscar nominations. Here’s the rundown.
Best Actress — Margot Robbie
Robbie is wonderful as Barbie and it’s her pitch-perfect performance that keeps the movie running. Other names (more on that below) might steal the spotlight but its selfless performance that makes the movie work. It also shows a deep understanding of tone and style while Robbie’s Barbie is the emotional heart of the movie. She is looking for her third Oscar bid after she was nominated in 2018 for Best Actress for “I, Tonya” and then again in 2020 for Best Supporting Actress for “Bombshell.”
However, Robbie is currently outside of our predicted five nominees in this category: Emma Stone (“Poor Things”), Natalie Portman (“May December”), Sandra Hüller (“Anatomy of a Fall”), Greta Lee (“Past Lives”), and Fantasia Barrino (“The Color Purple”). Plus, Jessica Lange (“Long Day’s Journey Into Night”) and Annette Bening (“Nyad”) are also ahead of Robbie, so there is some ground for Robbie to make up just yet. However, Robbie is one of the biggest stars on the planet right now and we know that voters like nominating young, big-name actresses in this category. Recent nominees include Ana de Armas (in 2023 for “Blonde”), Kristen Stewart (in 2022 for “Spencer”), and Scarlett Johansson (in 2020 for “Marriage Story”). Robbie fits right in with those names, while she is still in the Oscars gaze with those two recent nominations. That always helps.
Best Supporting Actor — Ryan Gosling
Probably the biggest takeaway from the movie is how brilliant Gosling is. He steals pretty much every scene he’s in and delivers one of the best comedic performances in cinema this century. It’s that good. He nails every beat. As such, Gosling is in our top five predicted nominees for Best Supporting Actor alongside Colman Domingo (“The Color Purple”), John Magaro (“Past Lives”), Robert Downey Jr. (“Oppenheimer”), and Robert De Niro (“Killers of the Flower Moon”). If he picks up the bid as we think he will, he will land his third-ever Oscar nomination after he was nominated twice for Best Actor — once in 2007 for “Half Nelson” and then again in 2017 for “La La Land.”
While Gosling’s performance may feel a little out there, there are actually a number of reasons to believe why he will pick up that bid (aside from how good the performance is, of course). Firstly, Gosling’s Ken is something of a villain. We know that the Academy like nominating villains in the Best Supporting Actor category. Sam Rockwell won for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” in 2018, Tom Hardy was nominated for “The Revenant” in 2016, J.K. Simmons won for “Whiplash,” Michael Fassbender (“12 Years a Slave”) and Barkhad Abdi (“Captain Phillips”) were nominated in 2014, and Christoph Waltz won for “Inglourious Basterds” in 2010. Plus, it’s a performance that combines singing, dancing, and acting. Bradley Cooper was lauded for his singing work in “A Star is Born,” which landed him a Best Actor bid. Austin Butler was praised for his singing and dancing in “Elvis,” which garnered him a Best Actor bid. And Andrew Garfield received plaudits for his singing and dancing in “Tick, Tick… Boom!,” which resulted in, you guessed it, a Best Actor nomination. Gosling should be treated no differently.
Best Supporting Actress — America Ferrera, Issa Rae, or Kate McKinnon
There are a couple of options here. First, there are two Barbies. Rae plays President Barbie and has one of the funniest moments in the film right toward the end (she also gets the film’s only f-bomb, which makes her stand out). It’s a small-ish role, however, so it would likely be a long shot. There is also McKinnon, who portrays Weird Barbie — this character has more of a crucial role in the plot, which helps, while McKinnon has a couple of scenes where she is front and center and gets to show off her trademark comedy skills and wit. Out of all the supporting Barbies, it is McKinnon who stands out most. She is, like Rae, a long shot, but both she and Rae have proven awards credentials. Rae is an eight-time Emmy nominee (no wins, though) while McKinnon is a two-time Emmy winner (for Best Comedy Supporting Actress for “Saturday Night Live” in 2016 and 2017). So, we know that awards bodies like them. However, they are both looking for their first Oscar nominations. What does help them, however, is the fact that voters have often nominated supporting actresses with not much screen time. Aunjanue Ellis was nominated in 2022 for “King Richard,” Ruby Dee snagged a bid in 2008 for “American Gangster,” and Judi Dench won in 1999 for “Shakespeare in Love.” So it does happen.
However, the best shot at a Best Supporting Actress nomination is Ferrera, who plays Mattel employee Gloria, who helps Barbie in the real world. Unlike her costars Rae and McKinnon, Ferrera gets a lot of time to shine. She has a wonderful arc with Greenblatt, who plays her on-screen daughter, and it is arguably their relationship that is actually the thumping heart of the movie. Plus, Ferrera gets that stunning speech about the difficulties of being a woman. Not only is that a pivotal moment in the plot but it is also a powerful speech in and of itself and Ferrera delivers it with aplomb. It’s the sort of “Oscar moment” speech you need in a film (you can even imagine awards bodies playing this clip when reeling off their nominees on awards night) and is especially reminiscent of the speech that Laura Dern‘s divorce lawyer gave in “Marriage Story” about the difficulties of motherhood. That film was written and directed by Noah Baumbach, who co-wrote the “Barbie” script with Gerwig. It’s this speech that makes Ferrera a contender for Best Supporting Actress. However, at this time of writing, she is outside of our predicted five nominees for this category: Emily Blunt (“Oppenheimer”), Julianne Moore (“May December”), Danielle Brooks and Taraji P. Henson (both “The Color Purple”), and Lily Gladstone (“Killers of the Flower Moon”). Like Rae and McKinnon, Ferrera is looking for her first-ever Oscar bid.
If all three actors did land a nomination, however, it would be the most acting bids any Gerwig movie has ever received. “Lady Bird” was nominated for Best Actress (Saoirse Ronan) and Best Supporting Actress (Laurie Metcalf) in 2018 while “Little Women” matched those two bids in 2020 with Ronan again landing a Best Actress nomination and Florence Pugh snagging a Supporting Actress nomination. “Barbie” has already broken a lot of records already.

What she decides speaks to a legacy of mothers and daughters, and is the most genuine moment in the film.","Mothers, daughters, and spiritual connections – Barbie’s final moments are when it truly becomes a Greta Gerwig movie. Photo: Warner Bros.
Warning: This post discusses many plot details of Barbie, including the ending.
For most of its runtime, Barbie is a battle of the sexes. By the end of the film, the Barbies have learned how to successfully counter the Kens’ patriarchal takeover and successfully restored the matriarchy through tactics that have existed since men went to war over Helen of Troy. They pretend to be interested in whatever their Kens love to mansplain the most — who knew Stephen Malkmus existed in Barbie Land? — and then, once each of them has a Ken on the hook, all they have to do is make eyes at a rival Ken, and bam! The Kens go to war, and are too distracted to notice the Barbies’ coup. The Barbies even agree to engage in some patronizing tokenism, promising that the Kens can have “as much power and influence in Barbie Land as women have in the real world.” Maybe someday there will even be more than one Ken on the Barbie Supreme Court!
The lesson, which comes cut with sardonic vinegar, is that everyone’s input is valid and one gender shouldn’t run everything, even in a hyper-feminine fantasy world. “Not every night has to be girls’ night,” Margot Robbie’s “Stereotypical Barbie” concedes. Heartened by the gesture, Ryan Gosling’s Ken admits that he didn’t really like being in charge anyway, and that his turn towards men’s rights activism was motivated by two things: His love of horses, and his insecurity about his lack of identity separate from Barbie.
Barbie reassures him that he’s more than just her boyfriend/sidekick, and he’s more than his obsession with “beach,” too. He’s just Ken, and that’s enough — a reversal of the way the movie’s marketing dismissively used the phrase “just Ken.”
But what about Barbie? Her arc in the film has evolved from shallow self-involvement — her initial motivation for leaving Barbie Land for the real world was a vain fear of flat feet and cellulite — to a full-on existential crisis. Stripped of her plastic perfection and her unflappable optimism, she doesn’t have much to build an identity with, either. All she knows is that she’s not in love with Ken, and that she can’t go back to who she was before. “I don’t think I have an ending,” she says.
Enter Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), co-founder of Mattel and the inventor of the Barbie doll. Handler died in 2002, but her ghost has been renting out an office on the 17th floor of the Mattel building ever since, as the company’s CEO (Will Ferrell) explains. Ruth is warm and wise, with a sincere belief that Barbie represents infinite possibilities for girls. She also has “a double mastectomy and tax evasion issues.”
That’s close to the truth, at least. The real Handler underwent a single mastectomy in 1970, and went on to found a company called Ruthton Corp. that manufactured realistic prosthetic breasts. She and three other former Mattel employees — Handler and her husband were forced out of the company after she was diagnosed with breast cancer — were also indicted by a federal grand jury in 1978, on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The real accusations were more akin to a short selling scheme. (See another Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling movie, The Big Short, for more on that.) But “tax evasion” is pithier.
It’s about a spiritual connection between generations of women, passing down their hopes and dreams for a better world.
Ruth is the closest thing Barbie has to a mother. And unlike Handler’s daughter Barbara, who was embarrassed by her career-girl namesake, Barbie is thrilled to meet her maker. Ruth takes Barbie by the hand, and the two of them are whisked off to an infinite white void. Everyone waves goodbye, stiffly; Ken is wearing a “I am Kenough” tie-dyed pullover fleece, serene in his new sense of self.
Barbie remains anxious about her future, which is a new emotion for her. “I don’t feel like Barbie anymore,” the doll confesses, a statement about gaining subjectivity as much as it is about flat feet and cellulite. Ruth tells her that humans “only have one ending,” but Barbie already knows that; she’s been tortured by thoughts of death since her ordeal of becoming ordinary began. (As much as one can be ordinary when one looks like Margot Robbie.) “I want to be the one imagining, not the idea,” she tells Ruth.
Ruth’s subsequent revelation that Barbie had the ability to become human inside of her all along is stock stuff for an empowerment narrative. But there’s more going on underneath that sentiment. Barbie’s desire to be a subject, not an object, is a longing felt by human women whose worth in society is often measured by how aesthetically pleasing they are to men. Barbie would be more objectified in the real world than she was in Barbie Land. So why does she want to become human at all?
When Ruth tells Barbie to “close your eyes — now feel,” what appears on the screen is a rapid-fire montage of families laughing and playing together. Gerwig sourced this grainy footage from the film’s cast and crew; a young Margot Robbie appears in a few of the snippets, which came from Robbie’s personal collection of Super 8 home movies. And Barbie is overwhelmed by emotion picturing these images, which connect her to an intergenerational heritage that she couldn’t access as a fictional construct.
The essence of womanhood, and humanity, doesn’t have anything to do with careers or outfits. It’s about a spiritual connection between women of different generations, passing down their hopes and dreams for a better world for those who come after them. By taking Ruth’s hand, Barbie becomes another link in this infinite chain of mothers and children. She becomes human.
Greta Gerwig gave birth to her second child (a son, whose name hasn’t been revealed yet) four months ago, shortly before the first Barbie trailer hit the internet. Lady Bird, her semi-autobiographical debut feature, was all about the fraught relationship between a mother and a daughter. These are personal themes for Gerwig. And the moment when they culminate in images of her cast and crew — she also runs famously democratic sets — is when Barbie transcends corporate IP and becomes a Greta Gerwig film.
After Barbie’s emotional epiphany, there’s a fade to white that makes it seem, briefly, that Barbie ends with Barbie’s death. But that’s too bold of a choice even for this movie. The picture fades back in, and Barbie is riding in the backseat of Gloria’s (America Ferrera) car. She’s wearing a tan blazer and pink Birkenstock sandals, and gets out and goes into an office building for what initially looks like a job interview.
She walks up to a reception desk and gives her name as Barbara Handler, the same name as Ruth’s real-life daughter who inspired the doll. “I’m here to see my gynecologist,” she declares, happily. It’s a stinger for the ages, but the important bit is this: Now Barbie/Barbara is part of a legacy of female creation and personhood. She’s a Handler now, like Ruth.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmFyYmllLWVuZGluZy1leHBsYWluZWQtdHJhbnNjZW5kaW5nLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1pcC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Unless you've been living under a rock for the last few months, you will know that Barbie has taken the world by storm in its premier.
The movie starring Margot Robbie as the titular character and Ryan Gosling as Ken shows Barbie having to leave Barbieland and travel to the real world on a journey of self-discovery.

Well, it turns out some corners of the internet have been less than enthusiastic about the movie.
One video doing the rounds on TikTok shows a man saying that any man who sees Barbie is a 'beta'.

Meanwhile, far right YouTuber Ben Shapiro went on a massive tirade about just how bad the movie was, after he had gone to see it of course.
This reaction and Barbie's positive feminist messaging in the movie has led some people to use it as a way to gauge their relationship.
Essentially, ask your boyfriend or the man you're dating if he wants to see Barbie, and then note his reaction.
A video posted on TikTok by @swagaliciousvr0 proposes the experiment.

It asks: ""How does he react when you tell him you want to go with him? What are his thoughts on why certain things are happening in the movie?""
Among the questions was also: ""What are his thoughts on how Ken was portrayed?""
In the movie, Ken is quite deliberately written as a very one dimensional love interest character, a point which some men who saw it were quick to highlight.

Gee, I wonder where we might have seen 'one dimensional love interest' as a character before? The mind boggles.

2023-07-21 18:00:50+00:00,Meet ‘Barbie’ Breakout Ariana Greenblatt,'Barbie' Star Ariana Greenblatt talked to Margot Robbie about her boy problems and did tarot readings on set with Alexandra Shipp.,"Name: Ariana Greenblatt
Age: 15
Born and Raised: Born in New York, she spent a stint in Florida before moving to Los Angeles when acting started to pick up, when she was around 7 years old.
“It was kind of like a very natural accident. I was a dancer at first in Florida, but every time I had a dance I would treat it like the biggest performance of my life. So I’ve always kind of had that bug in me, to perform,” she says. “I came to L.A. for a family vacation and my dad knows a lot of people here, so we were just saying ‘hi’ to his old friends and then I was sent out by my manager at the time for a bunch of meetings and I didn’t know what they were. I just thought I was meeting people, but they were actually auditions for three different roles and I got all three of them in the same week. And that kind of snowballed.”
Big Break: Greenblatt stars in the summer’s most anticipated film “Barbie,” as one of the humans (America Ferrera is her mom in the film). The audition came to her without revealing what the project actually was.
“I didn’t know much about what it would actually be, but I just knew Greta [Gerwig] was involved with it, and that’s the only thing I needed to hear to put my life into the audition,” she says. “I did the first round of normal auditions and then once I realized Margot [Robbie] was Barbie and I started connecting the dots and the announcements were coming out, I’m like, ‘oh my God, this is insanity.’ I fully was just trying to keep my cool and get to know my character really well.”

Growing Up Barbie: “I grew up with the Barbie Dreamhouse. But it’s weird because I didn’t have a lot of Barbies: I had a lot of Monster High dolls, so I put my Monster High dolls inside the Dreamhouse and acted like it was their house,” Greenblatt says. “But I always loved watching the Barbie Dreamhouse show.”
Barbie Bonding: “I got really close with Alexandra Shipp, who was one of the Barbies. I would always go into her trailer while filming and she would give me little tarot card readings. We would eat snacks together and talk about life,” Greenblatt says. “Same with America, who plays my mom. And Margot too, towards the end of filming; she became like an older sister and I would tell her about my boy problems and my school problems and she was just always there to listen and we would gossip about my life and it was great. She was like my little outlet.”
Career Goals: “I think Natalie Portman has had such a great career. She’s been doing it since she was really young as well, and I think she’s navigated it in a beautiful way. And she went to school and she’s really smart and well spoken. So I really like her career. Also Saoirse Ronan, I think she has an incredible career, and she’s also so young still. I think women like that, who have paved the way for themselves and also managed to either prioritize school or prioritize other things too, which is really cool.”
Up Next: “Obviously with this writer’s strike, everything is kind of crazy, but I definitely have a few things still that will be coming out — some I cannot talk about at all. Yeah. But one that has already been announced is ‘Borderlands’ that should be coming out towards the end of the year. But yeah, you’ll see me more. You’ll get tired of me.”

Liz Pino has been spray-tanning celebrities for more than a decade, but it's Margot Robbie who has made one of the best impressions.
And when she worked with the star on ""Barbie,"" the spray tanner told Insider she had to go easy on the product since Robbie went ""much blonder"" for the part.
Pino said she has worked with Robbie on multiple films, and recently got her glowing for the ""Barbie"" world premiere. And the esthetician — who works at Queen Bee Salon & Spa in Culver City, California — said that the Australian actress is just as lovely as she seems.
""If you are a person that thinks Margot Robbie looks like the nicest person, her smile lights up the room, she's absolutely the most down to earth person — then you're 100% correct,"" Pino said.

""It's amazing, the camaraderie she has with her own people,"" Pino said. ""It's actually very refreshing and beautiful, to be honest. Maybe that's why she's so pretty.""
""What's in the inside,"" she added, shows on ""the outside.""
Before Pino started working with the future ""Barbie"" star, she said she had to prove her skills to Pati Dubroff, Robbie's makeup artist.

""Our job as spray tanners isn't just laying down some color and calling it a day, that is the absolute antithesis of what we do,"" Pino said. ""We have to match tone, we have to match color, we have to sometimes hit a certain era. There's a lot more color match in our art than people realize.""

Pino said she helped consult the UK makeup artists who worked on Robbie's shade for ""Barbie"" during filming in London. And when it came time for the world premiere, she created a custom-blended tan to match Robbie's ""Barbie"" look.
""Margot is one of those people that a little bit goes a long way,"" Pino said. ""We also have to match hair very specifically as well. She's much blonder for this, so even less is more.""
After 20 years of experience, Pino has become a master of spray tanning and it's many tips and tricks — including a $5 hack for getting rid of orange hands.

,Barbie: 7 Sublime Details I Noticed After Watching Margot Robbie's Movie A Second Time,There are seven sublime details I noticed after seeing Margot Robbie's Barbie in theaters a second time.,"Major spoilers for Barbie are ahead!
When I walked out of Barbie , I almost immediately thought: “I have to see this movie again.” I was so moved by Greta Gerwig’s third well-reviewed film and couldn’t get over the performances from Margot Robbie , Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera. However, I also knew I missed tons of details. The film is visually stunning and also has meaning and humor packed into every frame. So, when I went back to see the movie again, I put on my thinking cap, and I took note of my seven favorite sublime details.
From left to right: Margot Robbie as Barbie in yellow dress and America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt holding each other in bright pink jumpsuits.
While Barbie’s Style Starts To Mirror The Humans, Their Style Evolves To Reflect Hers
One of the major details that emerged for me during this rewatch pertains to the wardrobe. All the bright neon and fringe-tactic Barbie fashion wowed me the first time. This time around, though, I noticed how the outfits in the film actually helped visualize the internal journey the characters go on.
This is primarily seen in the titular character's transformation. As she accepts her human-ness, her outfits also start to mirror the style of the regular world. Rather than sporting super dressy ensembles, she begins wearing casual clothes. Instead of big glam, she opts for more neutral makeup. And most importantly, in lieu of wearing heels every day, she sports sensible wedges and Birkenstocks.
For the inverse of this situation, we can look at Sasha’s style. At the beginning of the movie, Ariana Greenblatt's character wears all black, and she is not accepting of the Barbie mentality (at all). However, as the movie goes on, the teen's looks start to get pinker as she starts to care for the dolls, their land and most importantly, her mom’s belief in the beloved brand.
Overall, this stylistic evolution helps reiterate the transformative journeys the film's characters go on, and I’m obsessed with it.
From left to right: Ryan Gosling looking angry and Kingsley Ben-Adir standing right behind him looking concerned.
Kingsley Ben-Adir’s Ken Is An Underrated Comedy King
Everyone in the Barbie cast plays their part to perfection, yet the underrated comedy king of this movie is hands down Kingsley Ben-Adir. He plays the Ken who is always a half-step behind Ryan Gosling’s Ken and is constantly reacting to and trying to help his bestie.
A prime example of Ben-Adir’s comedic genius is when Margot Robbie's character finds out her dream house has been turned into a ""mojo dojo casa house."" As Gosling's Ken explained how patriarchy has taken over, he grabbed numerous manly items and handed them to Ben-Adir’s iteration of the doll. His hands became fuller, as he held a golf club, boxing gloves, a soccer ball, some brewsky beers amid his BFF's little monologue -- and I couldn’t stop laughing.
While he didn't have many lines, his physical comedy (like his frightened facial expressions during the Battle of the Kens) had me cackling on my second screening.
Ryan Gosling as Ken in Barbie
We Need To Take A Minute To Appreciate Ken’s Vocabulary
Ken’s unique vocabulary is easily one of the funniest elements of this fantasy romp. While the internet is properly obsessed with “mojo dojo casa houses,” there are lots of other silly words that Ryan Gosling’s character and this male cohorts spout out throughout the flick. Here are a few of my favorites:
Truck-car
Lady fashions
President Prime Minister Man
Kendom Land
Long-term, long-distance, low-commitment, casual girlfriend (they never say it the same way twice)
Fauxjo mojo mink
The silly synonyms Ken uses to over-describe his land and his possessions crack me up, and Ryan Gosling’s seriously committed delivery of his lines only made them better. Now, it’s just a matter of time before these words seep into my daily vocabulary.
From left to right: Ncuti Gatwa holding his arms up and Emma Mackey looking to her left, both in Barbie.
Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa Are Besties In Barbie Land
Greta Gerwig must have done this for the Sex Education fans. Throughout the movie, you can adorably see the characters played by Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa, two principal Sex Education cast members, hanging out together. And near the end, when Gatwa’s Ken says he just wants to be friends with Barbie again, he’s referencing Mackey’s Barbie. That declaration made me smile and hope Gerwig crafted that pairing because she’s also a fan of the coming-of-age comedy.
And of course, if you’re interested in checking out the two actors' breakout roles, you can stream Sex Education with a Netflix subscription .
Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie in the Barbie movie
Weird Barbie’s Tools And Handmade Outfits Are Iconic
While Weird Barbie’s looks are obviously the way they are because a kid played with her too hard, her wardrobe and tools are also comprised of objects only children could likely imagine -- and those were brilliant creative decisions. When Margot Robbie's version of the doll went to see Kate McKinnon's weird variant for the first time, I noticed she spotted the space-time continuum crack through a cootie catcher. From there, I began to make other observations about the humorous outcast and her style.
Later, toward the end, when we see Kate McKinnon’s character in her battle outfit, she has tin foil knee and elbow pads. She also has a key ring of small doll legs at her hip and thread grenades strapped across her chest. Overall, these lovely little details reiterate the notion that the dolls of Barbie Land are impacted by the kids who are playing with them. As a whole, this style example, in particular, exemplifies the wild ways in which kids use their imaginations while playing with toys. That's an element of this movie that's very admirable.

We’re Told Who The Barbie Creator Is Before It’s Officially Revealed

When Barbie meets Ruth in her kitchen at the Mattel offices, she doesn’t know that she just interacted with the creator of the iconic dolls. While it can be inferred by the audience that that’s who she met, it’s not officially revealed until the end of the film. However, if you look closely at the table Ruth is working at, you'll see she’s cutting what looks like doll’s clothes out of pink gingham fabric.

Margot Robbie’s character is wearing a couple of pink gingham ensembles early in the movie, so this feels like a nice little nod to the greater role Rhea Perlman’s character plays at the end of Barbie .

When Allan Attacks The Construction Men, He Yells His Motto

Despite the fact that he can’t jump a fence, Michael Cera’s Allan knows how to throw a punch or two. And if the situation weren't hilarious enough, he yelled his motto before initiating the fight:

I’m Allan, Ken’s buddy, all his clothes fit me.

The first time I watched the movie, this line flew right over my head, as I was too thrown off by Allan’s action-star moment. However, during my second watch, I caught it and couldn’t stop laughing over the fact that this scene was where the writers decided to place the one-of-a-kind boy doll’s iconic motto. Michael Cera really crushed this sequence, especially when it came to his delivery of this humorous and brief line.

Overall, there are so many fun details to make note of in Barbie, and Greta Gerwig really seemed to pack the movie full of fun moments, easter eggs and designs that make it so that one notices something different with each viewing. With that, it may be fair to say that people may be prompted to revisit this stellar flick for some time.

2023-07-21 21:22:22+00:00,Margot Robbie allegedly had tons of work done to look like Barbie,"Cosmetic surgery experts opine that the beautiful ""Barbie"" star looks different than years ago and may have had various procedures done.","It takes a lot of work to be Barbie.

In a recent Instagram post, cosmetic procedure influencer Dana Omari Harrell rehashed her claim from nearly a year ago that Margot Robbie, the star in Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” allegedly went through a huge transformation to resemble the iconic doll.

When asked by Siffat Haider on The Dream Bigger Podcast who is her favorite celebrity transformation, Harrell was quick to bring up Robbie.

But Harrell isn’t here to hate on Robbie, saying the actress “still looks natural” from the “incredible work.” She even starts her caption referring to “the always gorgeous Margot Robbie.”

Along with providing many side-by-side, then-and-now pictures of Robbie, Harrell also exhaustively lists, in the post’s caption, everything she believes Robbie has had done over the years to achieve her current Barbie look.

3 Margot Robbie in 2016’s “The Legend of Tarzan” (left) and in 2023’s “Barbie.”

“She has had an upper bleph (esp removing some fat under her brow), undereye filler or other augmentation, a minimal brow lift, cheek augmentation, buccal fat removal, lip filler, nose job thinning her tip and reducing the width of her nostrils,” she said.

Robbie’s team did not respond to a request for comment.

“Bleph” is short for “blepharoplasty,” a surgical operation to correct disfigurations of the upper and/or lower eyelids. An upper blepharoplasty, which Harrell is claiming Robbie had done, can involve fixing drooping eyelids, repairing the muscle that opens the eyes and removing excess fat in the eye area.

3 Margot Robbie in 2013’s “About Time” (left) and in 2023’s Barbie.

Buccal fat removal is a procedure done to thin the cheeks, specifically in the cheek hollows.

Harrell continued she believes “a little volume” has been added to Robbie’s “chin as her chin has more length now.” The sparing use of botox also isn’t out of the question, “just enough to soften but not enough to prevent movement.”

Harrell tagged Lorry Hill in her caption, citing and agreeing with Hill’s belief that something was done to change “her eye shape a bit.”

Hill regularly analyzes alleged celebrity transformations on her YouTube channel. Her most recent video breaks down if Robbie’s looks are natural, created or both.

Like Harrell, Hill isn’t here to bash Robbie for her new look, which keeps her looking “exceptionally beautiful.”

In her own Instagram post advertising her Robbie video, Hill captioned, “New YouTube Celeb analysis; the beautiful Margot Robbie! This one seemed to strike a nerve with people.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzIxL21hcmdvdC1yb2JiaWUtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWhhZC10b25zLW9mLXdvcmstZG9uZS10by1iZS1iYXJiaWUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjEvbWFyZ290LXJvYmJpZS1hbGxlZ2VkbHktaGFkLXRvbnMtb2Ytd29yay1kb25lLXRvLWJlLWJhcmJpZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-25 15:55:48+00:00,‘Love Island’ Star Was Cast in ‘Barbie’ After Meeting Margot Robbie: ‘I Started Talking About Male Genitalia and the Rest Is History’,"Chris Taylor met Margot Robbie at an afterparty where he discussed ""male genitalia"" with the star and ended up scoring a part in the movie","“Love Island” star Chris Taylor told Piers Morgan how a “panicked” chat with Margot Robbie about “male genitalia” at an afterparty ended up in a role for him in the blockbuster “Barbie” movie.

Taylor joined Piers Morgan Uncensored on Monday to debate the contents of “Barbie,” specifically whether the portrayal of men within the movie is fair.

More entertaining than the debate, however, was Taylor’s recounting of how he secured the part. The “Love Island” star has one line in the film in which he plays a Ken in Barbieland.

Morgan highlighted that Taylor’s trajectory from reality TV to starring in a blockbuster movie is “not a normal progression for ‘Love Island.’”

“It’s fairly overwhelming,” replied Taylor.

According to Morgan, the story about how Taylor got the part is “equally mind-blowing.”

Some of Taylor’s friends had been at a movie premier that Robbie was attending and they were invited to an afterparty that she was throwing. Taylor joined them at the afterparty where he was introduced to Robbie.

Robbie is known to be a huge “Love Island” fan, publicly voicing her support for the show in multiple interviews. When Taylor met her, she already knew who he was.

“And then I started talking about male genitalia and the rest is history,” said Taylor.

“Was this true?” Morgan questioned.

“I didn’t make that up,” responded the “Love Island” star. “A friend of mine has a micro-penis.”

“How small?” asked Morgan. “I mean, you were telling Margot Robbie.”

“It’s small. I’d say an inch,” said Taylor.

“Then you have a mate with very large testicles, is that right?” asked Morgan.

Taylor laughed and replied, “My dad’s best mate has very big bullocks and he can carry 12 bottles of beer on it.”

“And this is how you managed to get inside Margot Robbie’s head to end up playing Ken,” said Morgan.

“I will say I panicked and I just said whatever came to my head,” Taylor said in justification of his bizarre conversation.

“It was relevant,” Taylor continued. “like people were talking about penises.”

“This is how you basically wooed Margot Robbie to get in the movie,” concluded Morgan. “Next thing, 18 months later, you are in Barbie.”

“I am in Barbie,” said Taylor. “All because of micro-penises and big balls.”

2023-06-30 14:58:54+05:30,"Margot Robbie’s Barbie movie likely to open with $80 million, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer eyes $40 million","Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie, is projected to earn over $80 million on its opening day while Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer could make $50 million.","Greta Gerwig's highly-anticipated live-action film, Barbie , starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll, is expected to make a remarkable opening at the box office, potentially reaching or surpassing $80 million on its first day in theatres.

Also, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, featuring Cillian Murphy, has the potential to debut with an impressive $50 million in box office earnings. Both films are scheduled to release on July 21 and are anticipated to contribute to a collective weekend box office revenue of nearly $200 million in the United States from July 21 to July 23.

Barbie and Oppenheimer, according to a recent report, are generating significant buzz among fans. While Warner Bros conservatively projects a $60 million opening for Barbie, industry insiders suggest that the film could achieve a minimum of $80 million on its opening day. Furthermore, with its star-studded cast and widespread appeal, Barbie has the potential to exceed expectations and potentially reach a $100 million start.

Oppenheimer, a thought-provoking drama delving into the origins of the atomic bomb, is predicted to earn between $40 million and a possible $50 million in its opening weekend. Comparing the two films, distribution insiders have noted that Oppenheimer is expected to attract a more mature and predominantly male audience while Barbie appeals to a younger and primarily female demographic.

The projected weekend box office earnings of nearly $200 million will also include the $35 million expected from the second weekend of the highly-anticipated Tom Cruise-led Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, set to release on July 12.

Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig, associated with the Oppenheimer project, recently shared images on social media, promoting the film alongside tickets for other highly anticipated releases such as Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and Oppenheimer itself.

In the forthcoming irreverent comedy Barbie, the eponymous doll and Ken (played by Ryan Gosling) venture into the real world, much to the chagrin of a Mattel executive portrayed by Will Ferrell. Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, presents a biographical account of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist instrumental in the development of nuclear weapons. The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.

,Margot Robbie and Tom Ackerley: A Timeline of the 'Barbie' Star's Marriage to Her Real-Life Ken,Margot Robbie has her real-life Ken by her side.,"She's turning the silver screen pink as Barbie this summer, but behind the scenes, Margot Robbie has her real-life Ken by her side.

Tom Ackerley is his name and, nearly seven years ago, the world learned he had become the two-time Oscar nominee's permanent other half when news broke that the two had secretly said ""I do"" in the bride's native Australia.

However, details of their special day have been kept close to their collective chest -- a reflection of the relationship they've managed to keep mostly private in the years before and after.

Still, fans have been able to keep up with the pair thanks to their joint red carpet appearances, Ackerley a steady figure by Robbie's side as early as 2014 through to as recently as July 9 at the world premiere of Barbie in Los Angeles. On the appropriately pink carpet outside the Shrine Auditorium, the picture-perfect couple rivaled Barbie and Ken, Robbie emulating the doll's 1961 glamour in a sparkling black bustier dress with Ackerley handsomely matching the moment in a black tuxedo.

""Margot Robbie was so happy at the L.A. premiere of Barbie. She is very proud of the movie and was having a great time at the after-party. She was taking photos with fans and her husband, Tom, is super supportive of her,"" a source told ET. ""He came and kissed her in the middle of the party.""

If your heart is already melting, just wait -- cue up the theme song for one of Robbie's most romantic movies, About Time, and revisit her and Ackerley's sweet love story below.

Suite Meeting

As the story reportedly goes, Robbie and Ackerley met on the set of the 2014 war drama, Suite Française, which she was cast in and for which he served as a third assistant director.

Roommates-Turned-Romance

Just as Robbie's star was rising with her breakout role in The Wolf of Wall Street, she moved in with six other roommates -- including Ackerley and other assistant directors she had befriended on Suite -- into a three-bedroom home in London. Eventually, she and Ackerley secretly became more than pals.

“We kept it a secret. Because we weren’t really taking it seriously. 'Oh, whatever, we’re just mates, we’re just mates.' And then... everyone found out,"" she recalled to The Guardian in 2018. The big reveal shook up the house -- albeit temporarily. ""It was dramatic. I’m not going into the details, but sh*t hit the fan. Our house turned into The Jerry Springer Show for a moment there. But then the dust settled, and it was all good,"" she said. ""Everyone was, like: 'No! This is going to ruin our group!' And then it didn’t. It was fine.""

Considering how things panned out, it was worth the short-lived commotion. ""I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit. And then this crept up on me,"" she told Vogue in 2016. ""We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don’t make it weird, Margot. Don’t be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, Of course we’re together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.""

Lucky Chaps

Before they were wife and husband, the two became work partners by co-founding the production company LuckyChap Entertainment with fellow former roommates Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara. Through the company, they have produced I, Tonya, Promising Young Woman and Barbie.

Wedding Bells

In December 2016, reports emerged that the couple had tied the knot in Robbie's native Australia. Shortly after, she posted a photo to her since-deleted Instagram account of them kissing while the focus was on the finger she was flashing the camera to show off a pear-shaped engagement ring. When she stepped out on the red carpet the next month, Robbie was proudly sporting the diamond ring on her left hand.

As for details of the nuptials, they've been kept close to the couple in the years since. However, Robbie did divulge this particular while doing press for Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood with co-star Brad Pitt. ""I walked down the aisle,"" she told MTV News, ""to the True Romance music.""

Honeymoon Havoc

During a 2018 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Robbie dished on her and Ackerley's delayed honeymoon -- which featured an unexpected cameo from Ellen DeGeneres herself. As the actress explained, their honeymoon had been delayed because she had to film for I, Tonya in the beginning of 2017.

After spending a few days at more remote accommodations in Tahiti, the newlyweds made their way to a luxury hotel for the last leg of the trip. To pass the time while it was raining, the pair decided to go to the gym, but Robbie quickly noticed that Ackerley's workout attire was not appropriate.

""Tom puts on these shorts that are like his oldest gym shorts and they're tiny,"" she described. ""They're like really short and there's nothing underneath."" Still, having been in a remote area before arriving, the couple was not expecting to run into anyone -- until they walked in and spotted DeGeneres, wife Portia de Rossi, and former President Barack Obama all using the gym.

Nuptial Stamp of Approval

In November 2018, nearly two years after their reported wedding, Robbie gave the concept of working with your significant other -- and marriage itself -- a glowing review. ""I'm a great advocate of doing business with your partner,"" she told Porter. ""Being married is actually the most fun ever, life got way more fun somehow. I have a responsibility being someone's wife, I want to be better.""

As for how they managed their marital status, production company, and Robbie's megawatt career, they see each other every three weeks no matter what. ""Even if we both have to fly to a country in-between where we both are for one night, we’ll do it and then fly back to work the next day,"" she told the magazine. ""And we speak all day, every day on the phone.""

2023-07-15 06:38:38-04:00,What’s Margot Robbie’s net worth? How much did she get paid for Barbie?,"Robbie appears to have significantly boosted her sizeable fortune with her starring role in the Barbie movie, which is out in the US this month.","Margot Robbie, who stars alongside Ryan Gosling in the eagerly-anticipated new movie Barbie, is believed to have a net worth of around $40 million. That’s the latest estimate - as of June 2023 - provided by the specialist website Celebrity Net Worth.

An Oscar-nominated actor

Most notably, Robbie’s fortune stems from an acting career that began on the Australian TV soap Neighbours in 2008, and has since brought two Academy Award nominations. She was up for Best Actress in 2018 for her lead role in the movie I, Tonya, before her performance in Bombshell led her to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 2020.

Among the other major credits on the 33-year-old’s resumé are appearances in films such as the Wolf of Wall Street, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Babylon, the Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey.

Producer and face of major brands

Robbie is also the joint owner of a production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, which is behind Barbie, the first ever live-action movie about the iconic Mattel fashion doll. An enterprise that Robbie co-founded in 2014, LuckyChap has produced other motion pictures that she has starred in, such as I, Tonya and Birds of Prey.

According to a report in Variety in 2022, Robbie’s salary for Barbie, which is to be released in the United States on 21 July, is $12.5 million. It’s a pay packet that is thought to have made her 2022′s highest-paid female actor.

The Australian’s income also comes from her numerous endorsements by well-known brands. She has worked as an ambassador for the fashion and fragrance firms Calvin Klein and Chanel, as well as the automobile manufacturer Nissan.

2023-08-19 20:22:59+00:00,The Reign of ‘Barbie’ Is Officially Over - Inside the Magic,"The reign of 'Barbie' at the box office is officially over thanks to another Warner Bros. title, 'Blue Beetle.'","It’s been a long (and very pink) run, but Barbie (2023) has finally been dethroned.

In the month since its release, Barbie has proved itself an indomitable force. Starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous iconic doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the film’s themes of girlhood, feminism, and the patriarchy have won over critics and audiences alike.

At the worldwide box office, Barbie has pulled in an estimated $1.212 billion on a $145 million budget. That doesn’t just make it successful – it makes Barbie a colossal hit, breaking Warner Bros. records, overtaking The Dark Knight (2008), and becoming one of the fastest movies to reach the billion-dollar club in history.

In terms of the historic Barbenheimer battle, Barbie has definitely come out on top – beating Oppenheimer (2023) in terms of numbers, at least. However, it’s inevitable that after a month on the top, its grip would slowly start to slip from the number one position, as is happening right now.

According to Variety, another Warner Bros. property is displacing Barbie at the domestic box office. The latest installment in its struggling DC franchise – and the second-to-last before James Gunn officially takes the helm and reboots the DC Universe – has just hit theaters and is headed for the top spot.

Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, Blue Beetle (2023) follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) as he gains superpowers from an alien scarab. Originally intended to be a direct-to-streaming release, it was later upgraded to the big screen, where it’s gained surprisingly impressive reviews from critics.

Considering the fact that it follows The Flash (2023) – AKA the biggest Warner Bros. box office bomb of all time – financial expectations were low. While the film definitely isn’t seeing the best superhero box office performance ever, it pulled in $10 million domestically on its first day. In comparison, Barbie made $6 million.

General sentiment towards DC movies is pretty low after The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023). That’s why we wouldn’t be surprised if Blue Beetle becomes a slow-burner, similar to the results seen by Pixar’s Elemental (2023), as word-of-mouth promotes the film. Whatever its final performance, at least it can say it snatched Barbie’s hot-pink crown.

Are you planning on seeing Blue Beetle? Let us know in the comments!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDgvYmFyYmllLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtYmx1ZS1iZWV0bGUtY2oxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-06-23 16:09:39+00:00,Margot Robbie Hints That She's Stepping Away From Acting After 'Barbie' - Inside the Magic,It seems like Margot Robbie has been hinting that she's shifting out of acting mode for the entire 'Barbie' press tour.,"“What Barbie do you see yourself as right now, personally, in this phase of your life?”

That’s the question that was, essentially, posed by the initial marketing campaign for Barbie – the big, bright, poppy “This Barbie Is…” images that the internet meme-ified within minutes once they released.

People all over, from stars to average Josephines, were posting pictures of themselves pasted over the brightly-colored starburst shapes, labeled with everything ranging from their profession to their emotional state of mind.

That is also the question, that, because of said memes, Fandango saw fit to ask Margot Robbie, Issa Rae, America Fererra, and Kate McKinnon in a recent interview.

America Fererra and Kate McKinnon Gave Two Comically Different Answers

Related: Kate McKinnon Says ‘Barbie’ Movie Proves That Gender Roles Are Dumb

America Fererra first made it clear that she’s not a Barbie, she’s a human – but she knew we knew that about her. She meant in the movie.

Fererra is the only person in the group who, in Barbie, does not hail from BarbieLand. In the most recent trailer, you can see her in the car with Margot Robbie’s Malibu Barbie, getting a tour for what is obviously the very first time.

Many have speculated that Fererra’s character, who is simply billed as “Gloria,” is likely an employee at Mattel, the company that created Barbie (headed by CEO Will Ferrell in the film.)

Fererra, similar to many people on the internet, especially women, went the self-care route with her Barbie slogan, saying:

“I guess the goal before was like, Be Everything To Everyone Barbie, and now the goal is like, Be Everything To Myself Barbie.

Kate McKinnon, at this point, was also sweet enough to jump in and say, “I think you’re an America Barbie.” (There was a little confusion before she clarified: “Not the country! The You!”)

McKinnon, for her part, simply said:

“For reasons that I won’t get into now, I’m Kayak Barbie.”

Right on, Kate.

Issa Rae Is The Most Focused Barbie On The Planet

Related: What Is “Big Ken Energy?” Margot Robbie and Issa Rae of ‘Barbie’ Explain

Issa Rae, meanwhile, got straight to the point with her answer:

“I’ma say this Barbie is On-Track Barbie. That’s it. I’m just focused in a new, different way, and not worried about other directions.”

A a demonstrative answer if there ever was one – even her replies are incredibly focused – and given that she is currently running both Hoorae Productions and Raedio – a production and audio production company, respectively – that’s a very good thing.

Running a production company is no easy task, and it’s incredibly hard to multi-task while you’re doing it – especially given that “Producer” often means “designated multitasker” when it comes to projects like hers.

Speaking of being a multitasking producer, it was the movie’s star-slash-producer, Margot Robbie, whose answer to the question was the most interesting – even if on the surface, it sounded fairly similar to her co-stars’ answers.

Margot Robbie Might Be Transitioning From Acting Barbie to Producing Barbie

Related: ‘Barbie’ Cast Describes the Weirdest Ways They Played With Their Barbies

Margot Robbie’s answer to the question seemed regular enough, but in the context of her interviews during the rest of this press tour, we wonder if she might be hinting at a big career move:

I think I was very Do-It-All Barbie…like multitasking was such an asset – and now I’m kinda like, Do-It-Well Barbie, like I kinda wanna do less and just be better at those few things.

In earlier interviews on the film’s press circuit, Robbie has indicated that she had no intention of playing Barbie in this film when her production company, LuckyChap, began working on it. Greta Gerwig, and many others involved, seem to have more or less assumed that she would step into the role, and eventually she got the memo.

It’s also no secret that Robbie has been busy – that same interview where she first mentioned that she wasn’t her own first choice described her as being in “producer mode,” constantly running around, making and answering phone calls, firing off texts, etc.

It certainly wouldn’t be a stretch to translate Margot Robbie saying she wants to do fewer things and do them better as her saying she wants to stop trying to focus on two careers at once, and simply focus on becoming the best producer she can be for the foreseeable future. (Not that she’s not obviously doing a great job so far.)

If this is true, it’s all the more reason to savor what will no doubt be a phenomenal acting performance from Robbie when Barbie finally comes to theaters on July 21.

2023-07-17 14:10:49+00:00,Margot Robbie's Latest Film Promotion Is Disgusting - Inside the Magic,"Barbie is ramping up to be one of Warner Bros Discovery's biggest hits of the year, and this is what it's being promoted with?","Margot Robbie’s Barbie is getting the weirdest cross-promotion item imaginable (weirder than Doctor Who, even): the Barbie Burger and people are disgusted by it.

The Greta Gerwig-directed Mattel film is being released around the world on July 21, and as part of its extensive marketing campaign, Burger King has released a special Barbie-edition burger. The only problem is that… well, it looks pretty horrifying.

See for yourself:

Combo BK Barbie™️, já disponível em todo Brasil 💅 pic.twitter.com/qjD9ONB8P8 — Burger King BR 💅💖🎀 (@BurgerKingBR) July 12, 2023

The Barbie Burger is available only in Brazil (for now) and is being heavily promoted by the official Burger King BR Twitter and Instagram accounts. According to the latter, “Barbies from all over Brazil, check out this news that arrived straight from Barbie Land™️ to our kingdom! 👑💖 It’s real, NOW you can come running to BK to try the BK Barbie™️ Combo… The Pink Burger with delicious smoky pink sauce, Ken’s Potato – which comes in this special shell-shaped packaging – and the Barbie™️ Donut Shake. No they are not plastic… they are real food and AWESOME! ✨Check out that the BK Barbie™️ Combo and dessert, sold separately, are available from July 12th in all BKs and BK Drives throughout Brazil, and also through BK Delivery. Don’t waste time because it’s limited edition.”

While the above text is translated from Portuguese and might have lost something in translation, it is rarely a good sign when you have to explicitly say that a (presumably) edible foodstuff is not made out of plastic.

Of course, it is also understandable why Burger King BR felt the need to say that the Barbie Burger is not a wholly artificial creation of pure science; as many people online are pointing out, the “delicious smoky pink sauce” has a striking resemblance to Pepto-Bismol, which is not often associated with deliciousness.

The marketing campaign for Barbie has heavily relied on pink imagery and previews of the movie have clearly shown the deliberate artificiality of Barbie Land, so presumably, the minds at Burger King in charge of this sort of thing decided to lean into it. At the very least, it’s making people talk about the upcoming Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling movie.

However, it is much more debatable whether denizens of Twitter have anything good to say about the Barbie Burger and Burger King BR. Early critical reviews of the movie have been glowing, so maybe Warner Bros should focus more on that and less on the disgustingly pink burgers.

2023-07-16 17:15:17+00:00,Margot Robbie Had the Most Priceless Reaction To Finding Out Which Barbie Character She’s Really Like,Margot Robbie discovered she wasn't Barbie after taking the movie's personality quiz — watch the video.,"Throughout the press tour for Greta Gerwig’s upcoming film Barbie, Margot Robbie has lived, breathed, and dressed as the iconic character. At this point, the two-time Oscar nominee is basically Barbie. But what if we told you she wasn’t? Robbie and the cast of the film took a personality quiz to see which Barbie character they’re most like in real life, and Robbie’s reaction to her result was totally priceless.

While chatting with Buzzfeed, Robbie, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, and Michael Cera scrolled through a series of oddly specific questions and prompts to identify which character they are from the movie. Parts of the quiz asked, “What’s a quality you look for in a friend?” while others cued the cast to “Pick a color to paint your dreamhouse.” Everyone’s answers were, as you can see in the video below, fairly different. Then it was time for the big reveal.

“I can’t believe my results,” Robbie said to her cast mates. “I’m Ken!” Robbie’s voice did have a tinge of disappoint to it. “This is how I felt when I did the Pottermore quiz to see which house I’d be in,” Robbie, a noted Hufflepuff, continued. Even after reading the description of the affable character, Robbie rejected her result that she is Ken, saying, “No, I’m not!”

Slamming her phone face down on the Barbiecore pink sofa, Robbie pondered what response could have possibly given her Ken. Ultimately, though, we know Robbie is Barbie. Maybe the quiz just goes to show each of us has Kenergy within us all. Embrace the Kenergy, Margot! You are Kenough just the way you are!

2023-07-20 15:50:46+05:30,"Ahead of Margot Robbie’s Barbie movie release, Bollywood celebs rock Barbiecore trend","The Barbiecore trend has firmly established itself as B-town's favorite. Celebrities have effortlessly incorporated this trend into their wardrobes, showcasing pink-hued dresses, power suits, swimwear, and even ethnic attire.","It’s time to embrace the pink vibe! While the pink aesthetic or the Barbiecore trend has been doing the rounds for some time now, the fever for everything pink has soared recently, thanks to Margot Robbie’s upcoming film Barbie, which is set to release on July 21.

The Barbiecore trend is a fashion and aesthetic trend that emerged in recent years, drawing inspiration from the iconic Barbie doll and its associated imagery. It embraces a playful, colorful, and ultra-feminine style, reminiscent of the popular children’s toy.

The significance of the Barbiecore trend is rooted in its celebration of femininity and the empowerment of women. By embracing the aesthetic of the Barbie doll, which has historically faced scrutiny for perpetuating unrealistic beauty ideals, Barbiecore aims to reclaim and reshape those standards. It fosters an environment that promotes self-expression, individuality, and confidence by embracing exaggerated femininity and embracing elements traditionally associated with “girly” aesthetics. Through Barbiecore, individuals are encouraged to embrace their unique identities and challenge societal norms, embracing a diverse and inclusive understanding of beauty.

,Looking back at Margot Robbie's 'Barbie'-inspired press tour looks: All the photos,Margot Robbie is channeling many iconic Barbie-inspired looks during the global press tour for the Greta Gerwig-directed film.,"""Barbie"" is in theaters now.

Margot Robbie has channeled many iconic Barbie-inspired looks during the global press tour for her upcoming film.

Before the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike began on July 14, 2023, Robbie paid tribute to many famous Mattel dolls from the past while on the ""Barbie"" press tour to promote the film. For inspiration, Robbie replicated vintage looks pulled from the fashion archives.

For the European premiere of ""Barbie"" in London earlier this month, Robbie transformed into the 1960s Enchanted Evening Barbie doll.

To channel the vintage doll, she wore a custom look from Vivienne Westwood.

Following the premiere, she switched into another look from Turkish-British designer Dilara Findikoglu, which referenced a red swimsuit-wearing Barbie from 1962.

With the help of her stylist Andrew Mukamal, Robbie's ""Barbie"" style has included references to everything from pieces different dolls have worn over the years to runway looks inspired by the famous brand.

At the film's world premiere in Los Angeles on July 9, Robbie channeled the Solo in the Spotlight '60s Barbie when she wore a black sequined Schiaparelli dress.

Mukamal also shared another look from the same event that paid homage to the same Barbie.

During a photo call on June 29 in Sydney, Australia, the actress wore a black and white striped mini dress -- a nod to the first Barbie doll ever released. That famous doll, released in 1959, was dressed in a black and white striped swimsuit with white sunglasses.

When Robbie first arrived in Australia last month, she was spotted in a runway look that showed she's fully embracing the ""Barbiecore"" trend during the press tour.

For her airport look, the actress donned a Chanel Spring/Summer 1996 look that included a tweed pink blazer paired with jeans and slingback heels.

To celebrate the first day of the ""Barbie"" press tour, the film's official account shared a post of Robbie grinning in the back of her pink convertible. She wore a pink matching set from Bottega Veneta.

Ahead of the press tour, one of the first Barbie-inspired looks Robbie debuted was in April, at CinemaCon 2023 in Las Vegas.

2023-07-12 10:09:38+00:00,Net worth of ‘Barbie’ star Margot Robbie and how she spends her fortune,Margot Robbie has built her net worth on the back of successful movies. Now she is set to make more with 'Barbie.' Here's all that she owns.,"Margot Robbie is an Australian actor hailed as one of the biggest names in Hollywood. She owes her success to the brilliant characters she portrays in movies, which majorly contribute to her high net worth.

Robbie was born in Dalby, Queensland, and started her acting career in Australia before moving to the US sometime in the early 2010s.

In just a decade, she has cemented her name as one of the most bankable stars in the industry. Her outstanding performances in films, such as I, Tonya (2017) and Bombshell (2019), and big-budget franchise movies of DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have turned Robbie into an instantly recognisable worldwide name from Japan to the American west coast.

She has also successfully added the tag of producer to her name as well as that of a businessperson, partnering with her husband, British filmmaker Tom Ackerley, on several acclaimed movies.

Interestingly, Robbie is known for being an extremely private person. She is not on social media, having apparently deactivated her Instagram account sometime after announcing a break from social platforms in 2021. Her Facebook account has only a handful of posts, and most of them are related to her films, with the last post being from March 2018.

Margot Robbie: A look at her career

Margot Robbie started her acting career with the Australian TV series Neighbours (2008–2011, 2022). Her breakthrough role came with The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and she has since gone on to lead major critically and commercially successful films, such as Z for Zachariah (2015), I, Tonya, Mary Queen of Scots (2018), Bombshell, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) and Asteroid City (2023).

Her portrayal of Harley Quinn in three DCEU films — Suicide Squad (2016), Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2021) — has been hailed universally by fans of the iconic DC comic book character.

She has garnered two Academy Award nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and five BAFTA nominations so far. She has also been recognised by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2017.

How much does Margot Robbie earn from films?

Celebrity wealth tracker Celebrity Net Worth estimates Margot Robbie may have a net worth of USD 40 million.

Much of this is obviously because of her film career. But it is not clear how much she may have made from the movies she has been a part of as an actor or producer in the earlier years.

Commenting about her stint in Neighbours, she told Vanity Fair in 2014 that she “saved up enough to get me through three years unemployed.” Some reports suggest that she was paid somewhere around USD 350,000 for The Wolf of Wall Street and almost double that figure two years later for Z for Zachariah.

But by 2019, she was listed by Forbes as one of the highest-paid actresses in the world with total earnings of USD 23.5 million. The publication noted that a prime reason behind her income was the eight-figure upfront earnings from Birds of Prey of which she was also a producer.

Her income in recent years is better known, especially for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie — one of the most-anticipated films of 2023.

Robbie plays the titular character, who is based on the world-famous Mattel doll, and stars alongside Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken. The film also has a larger A-list star cast, including Dua Lipa, Emma Mackey, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa and John Cena, playing different versions of Barbie and Ken. The film also stars America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.

According to multiple reports both Robbie and Gosling have been paid USD 12.5 million each for Barbie. It is not clear if Robbie or any of the other actors have a share in the profits of the film, similar to how some A-list stars, such as Tom Cruise, the star of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023), do in their cases.

Nevertheless, Robbie serves as one of the producers of the film. This means her overall paycheck from Barbie will be much higher than her acting fees of USD 12.5 million.

Margot Robbie’s endorsements and businesses

The face of Calvin Klein and Chanel

Robbie became the face of Calvin Klein’s Deep Euphoria fragrance in 2016. The scent has cascalone and mandarin leaf as its top notes; black rose and geranium, among others, as middle tones; and patchouli and musk as base notes.

She became a brand ambassador of Chanel in 2018 and since then has worn the brand’s dresses for most of her public appearances. However, it is unclear if she continues to be the brand ambassador of the luxury fashion brand, as Robbie has been seen wearing a series of Bottega Veneta creations in November 2022.

Though she picked a Chanel for her 2023 Golden Globes appearance, she was seen in a Valentino at the London premiere of her film Babylon and wore Bottega Veneta in January 2023.

Be it Calvin Klein, Chanel or Bottega Veneta, details of the deal in each of them are not known.

Nissan electric’s ambassador

Robbie was named Nissan’s first electric vehicle ambassador by the Japanese auto giant in February 2017. As part of the promotional event, which was held in Monaco, Robbie went behind the wheels of a Nissan BladeGilder concept car and raced it down the streets.

In her role as Nissan Electric Vehicle Ambassador, Robbie said, “Our lives are literally turning electric, but the sad fact is that so many people around the world still don’t have access to a reliable source of electricity at all.”

Some months later, a 2018 Daily Mail report cited a publicist saying that Robbie would be paid around USD 1 million over a period of two years as part of her ambassadorship.

Margot Robbie’s production company

Margot Robbie co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment with Tom Ackerley and some of their friends in 2014.

The production house has since released critically and commercially successful movies such as I, Tonya (2017), Promising Young Woman (2020) and Boston Strangler (2023), headlined by Robbie, Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley, respectively.

Through her company, Robbie is also the producer of Barbie whose total production budget is an estimated USD 100 million.

Papa Salt gin

Along with Tom Ackerley and industry friends, Charlie Maas, Josey McNamara and Regan Riskas, Margot Robbie used her net worth to co-found a new line of gin, Papa Salt, in May 2023.

Made in Byron Bay — a coastal town in New South Wales, Australia — the gin is reportedly inspired by the east coast of Australia. The brand’s website calls it an “easy-drinking gin that celebrates the subtle taste of native Australian botanicals.”

The official site also reveals that the founders experimented with 59 recipes before coming to the right combination for Papa Gin. It has notes of zesty wax flower, hibiscus and citrus peel as well as nutty wattleseed, pink peppercorn and a hint of oyster shell.

Expensive things Margot Robbie owns

Car collection

Unlike most other celebrities, it is difficult to find out the exact cars that Margot Robbie owns. While several reports say that she owns a Mercedes-Benz CLA, a Ford Explorer, a Mercedes G63 AMG and an Audi A6, among other cars, little can be ascertained about them.

Robbie has hardly ever been seen in them and, unlike Henry Cavill who posts pictures of his rides on social media, she never talked about four-wheelers while she was active.

However, older pictures show that she has at least owned a Hyundai Excel, a predecessor of the Hyundai Accent. During its production run from 1985 to 1999, the Hyundai Excel was one of the most affordable cars but had features that were found in more expensive cars of its kind. Pictures suggest that Robbie drove a green Hyundai Excel. It is not clear if she still owns it.

The other car that she has been seen in is a Cadillac Escalade. Made by American automaker General Motors, the Cadillac Escalade is a full-size SUV, a favourite among celebrities. A 2023 model of the car starts at around USD 81,000 and can go up to USD 151,000. Depending on the variant, it can either have a 6.2L V8 engine or a 6.2L Supercharged V8 engine. It has a top speed of just over 200 km/h.

Some reports indicate that she also owns a Nissan LEAF electric vehicle, which might make sense since she is a brand ambassador of the car brand. In fact, the Daily Mail report from December 2018 says that a publicist revealed she would likely be gifted a car by Nissan when she signed up to be their face.

A 2023 Nissan LEAF goes up to 340 km on a full charge on the back of its 40 kWh battery, which can be increased to 60 kWh. The starting price of the electric car is USD 28,000.

Real estate

In a short span of time, Margot Robbie strengthened her net worth on the back of smart investments in a real estate portfolio that helps her live comfortably in both the US and her home country of Australia.

One of Robbie’s best-known homes is located in the Venice Beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles. It was bought by the actor in around October 2019 for USD 5 million, shortly after she was named by Forbes as one of the world’s highest-paid female actors.

The property has three separate structures on a double-wide lot, the exact size of which is unknown. It is built like a fortress and has its own gate, alarm systems and CCTV cameras. Besides the main building, it has a two-bedroom separate structure and a cottage-style third structure. There is a three-car garage on the property as well.

In mid-2021, when parts of the property were still under construction, TMZ reported that its total worth will be an estimated USD 15 million.

Besides her US address, Robbie is believed to own a home in Byron Bay. It was bought by her in 2018 for around USD 3 million. Australian media reports from the time suggest that she indeed had a look at the property located in Linnaeus Estate, which was a private gated beachfront estate, between Byron Bay and Lennox Head.

The timber-lined property is situated next to a beach. It has an all-white interior, large kitchen and designer bathroom, as well as a treehouse-like alfresco deck that extends out of the main building into the greenery-covered ground of the property.

In May 2023, Robbie and Ackerley reportedly took a look at another Byron Bay property. Reports say that the property, named Cedar Hill, is described as one of the ‘most beautiful homes’ in the country. It is situated around 10 km south of Byron Bay in a secluded place called Newrybar.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amir Prestige (@amirprestigegroup)

It was last sold in 2019 for around USD 1.6 million, but records indicate that another USD 2 million was spent on its redevelopment.

The barn-style main building sits on 20,000 square metres. It has eight bedrooms and as many bathrooms, along with an open-style kitchen, living and dining areas. It comes with custom-designed furniture, such as a 16-chair dining table and sofas covered in bohemian textiles. The house has an infinity pool, too. Glass, concrete, recycled timber and natural stone among other materials have been used in its construction.

In 2019, Robbie spent around USD 2 million on two adjoining homes on Gold Coast in Southport, Queensland. They were bought for her mother, Sarie Kessler, and older sister, Anya Robbie. Each property has two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a garage.

Five years before the dual purchase, she had also paid off her mother’s mortgage on their family home on Gold Coast. The family home was originally bought in 2007 by Sarie for around USD 300,000. It had four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a backyard pool. Some years after its mortgage was paid off, the Robbie family sold off the house.

Among her previous accommodations is a 312.5-square-metre home in a 603-square-metre plot in Hancock Park, a suburb of Los Angeles in California. It was one of the first major properties that the actor added to her portfolio. Robbie bought it in 2017, shortly after her marriage to Ackerley and their move to the US from London.

The two-floor home, built in 2016, is quite modest. It has four bedrooms, all decked in white walls and five-and-half bathrooms. A huge black chandelier hangs over a blue round sofa in the family room, which also has a fireplace. Just outside the huge floor-to-ceiling glass window of the room is the property’s outdoor pool, which has a low, yellow diving board.

In the kitchen is a Carrara marble sink and a six-seat counter. On the second floor is the master bedroom with a private balcony. The property also has a boutique wine cellar, spa, patio with a bar and pool bath, and an open-air cabana.

Robbie paid around USD 2.7 million for the property when she bought it. In May 2021, she sold the property for around USD 3.5 million.

In 2018, Robbie paid USD 950,000 to buy a house owned by Milk (2008) director Dustin Lance Black in Hollywood Heights in Los Angeles. Robbie bought the property as an investment and is, therefore, believed to have never lived in it. Originally built in the 1950s, the actual size of the two-bedroom and one-bath home is 88 square metres.

Robbie commissioned a restoration work on the property, following which the walls and the furnishings were given new colours and fittings. Right behind the property are two terraces that are built into a hillside and have enough space for seating. The uppermost terrace overlooks the house and gives a fantastic view of the neighbourhood.

Reports suggest that the house was immediately put on rent for USD 5,000 per month after Robbie bought it. In December 2020, she put it up for sale for USD 1.2 million.

We had a chance to sit down with the wonderful director of Barbie, Little Women, and Lady Bird, to discuss her career and future! Please enjoy this interview with Greta Gerwig:

What was it like working so closely with your partner Noah Baumbach?

“I don’t think about Noah at all in my work, really. I don’t even know where he sleeps.”

Did you play with Barbie dolls as a kid?

“Not at all. Two months into filming was actually when I learned that we weren’t making a Margot Robbie biopic. I thought it was strange she was playing herself!”

What’s the most difficult acting job you’ve had?

“Pretending to be attracted to Ben Stiller in Greenberg.”

What’s your next big project?

“I’m thinking about writing and directing a sequel to Little Women called Big Women. The characters are all still children, but they’re much larger now. In many ways, it will be the first film ever to turn on ‘Big Head’ mode.”

Have you seen Oppenheimer yet?

“No, I do not like movies that glorify the villainous act of being over 3 hours long.”

What was your favorite part of working on Barbie?

“For me, I found so much joy in forcing my woke agenda onto today’s youth through subtle pieces of propaganda. That’s what art is all about.”

What’s your favorite color?

“Probably green.”

What are you trying to say with your movies?

“Being a woman is actually easy as all fuck.”

How does it feel having such a massive career as a director after making only three films?

“People always forget that I co-directed a movie before Ladybird. It came out in 1991 and was called Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey.”

Do you think there will be a sequel to the Barbie movie?

“It is actually illegal in California to make more than $700 million dollars on a film and not make a sequel about the main character going to The City or Europe.”

Who would you love to cast as Barbie or Ken in the next Barbie movie?

“I think Danny Devito would be really funny as Ken. And for Barbie, I’d probably go with Danny Devito.”

How do you feel about the Mattel Cinematic Universe?

“Boo hoo, they’re making a bunch of movies about toys. Do you know what Stars Wars is? How about Marvel? What, you thought those were characters ripped from the collective unconscious? No. They’re toys. All of ‘em.”

What’s your favorite genre to work in?

“I love making comedy films, but it can be difficult for me. That’s why I named one of my movies ‘Frances Ha.’ Originally, it was just called Frances, but I wanted people to think of laughing while watching the movie.”

What inspired you to make Barbie?

“While my last several films have been well received, I couldn’t get anyone to produce any action figures based on Lady Bird or Frances Ha. I really just wanted to have toys based on a movie of mine, and this seemed like a better fit than the new Transformers film.”

Is it true you’ll be adapting C.S. Lewis’ Narnia books into feature films soon?

“Books? I thought I was adapting the 2005 Game Boy Advance game The Chronicles of Narnia!”

Come on. You’re telling me you didn’t know that the Narnia game was based on a book?

“No, I genuinely thought it was based on the Andy Samberg video.”

Is there any other piece of IP or franchise that you’d like to make a movie for?

“Yes.”

How do you feel about the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes?

“As a member of SAG, the WGA, and the DGA, I think all the unions should Voltron together into one giant union that takes over the U.S. government once and for all.”

What is something about Hollywood that most people don’t know?

“When you get famous enough, you can just clap your hands and yell ‘almonds!’ and someone will bring you at least five almonds right there.”

If you could work with anyone in Hollywood, who would it be?

“More than anything, I’d really love to collaborate with the 20-year-old child of a very powerful politician like Al Gore or Barack Obama.”

Do you like to pull any pranks on set?

“Every movie I fully submerge one member of the cast in molasses completely nude while everyone gathers around and boos. I don’t know why, I don’t even like it. It’s just something I do.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vaGFyZC1kcml2ZS5uZXQvaGQvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWctZm9yLXR3by1tb250aHMtaS10aG91Z2h0LWJhcmJpZS13YXMtYS1tYXJnb3Qtcm9iYmllLWJpb3BpYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-15 15:32:02+00:00,"Hollywood Is Taking the ‘Wrong Lessons’ From ‘Barbie,’ Says Randall Park: ‘Make More Movies by and About Women,’ Not Films Based on Toys","Randall Park says Hollywood is taking the wrong lessons from ""Barbie.""","In a recent interview with Rolling Stone to promote his directorial effort “Shortcomings,” actor and comedian Randall Park criticized Hollywood for taking the wrong lessons from a massive blockbuster like Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.” The Margot Robbie-led comedy has earned over $1 billion at the worldwide box office, but Park said making more movies about toys should not be the industry’s takeaway.

“I feel like, just in general, this industry is taking the wrong lessons,” Park said. “For example, ‘Barbie’ is this massive blockbuster, and the idea is: Make more movies about toys! No. Make more movies by and about women!”

The interviewer added, “The lesson here should be that you gave this brilliant independent woman filmmaker in Greta Gerwig the reins to a big blockbuster movie and had Margot Robbie star in and produce it.”

“Exactly!” Park said in approval. “Think like that. It’s Greta Gerwig!”

As Variety reported shortly after “Barbie” stunned the industry with a record-breaking $163 million opening, Mattel Films is hoping to use the film’s to success to jumpstart its movie ambitions. The studio has 14 movies in development based on Mattel toys and other properties, including Hot Wheels, Polly Pocket, American Girl, Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots, Magic 8 Ball, UNO and Matchbox. There’s also the “Barbie” sequel, which feels almost inevitable at this point given the first film’s success.

“Barbie, as a brand, has many different iterations. The product lines of Barbie is a very broad brand. In addition to the main Barbie figure, she has family, she has a lot of elements around in her universe,” Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said. “It’s a very rich universe… It’s a very broad and very elastic brand, in terms of opportunities.”

He continued, “At the outset, we’re not saying, ‘Okay, let’s think already about movie two and three.’ Let’s get the first one right and make that a success. And if you do that, opportunities open up very quickly, once you establish the first movie as a successful representation of a franchise on the big screen. Successful movies lend themselves to more movies. Our ambition is to create film franchises.”

Mattel is hoping to strike gold again with bringing a doll to life on the big screen courtesy of a Polly Pocket movie, which is being written and directed by Lena Dunham. Lily Collins is already attached to star. Mattel Films boss Robbie Brenner said the film has a “great” script.

“First of all, they are two of my favorite ladies ever,” Brenner said of Collins and Dunham. “It’s been an amazing collaboration. Lena is so collaborative and rolls up her sleeves and really likes to roll around in notes and listen. She’s incredible. Lily is so smart and so specific and so productorial. It’s just been an incredible collaboration, so we are thrilled about it. Hopefully, we’ll be making that at some point in the future.”

“Barbie” continues to play in theaters nationwide from Warner Bros.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLWhvbGx5d29vZC13cm9uZy1sZXNzb25zLW1ha2Utd29tZW4tZmlsbXMtbm90LXRveXMtMTIzNTY5NjcxNy_SAWtodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvZmlsbS9uZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1ob2xseXdvb2Qtd3JvbmctbGVzc29ucy1tYWtlLXdvbWVuLWZpbG1zLW5vdC10b3lzLTEyMzU2OTY3MTcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-08-01 19:30:59+00:00,Oscar predictions: Experts now say Margot Robbie (‘Barbie’) will be nominated for Best Actress,The top film journalists who have made their predictions at Gold Derby think Robbie is a strong contender for Best Actress.,"The rise of “Barbie” continues in our Oscar odds. As of this writing the blockbuster film’s star, Margot Robbie, has ascended into the top five for Best Actress, according to the Expert journalists we’ve surveyed from major media outlets. If they’re right this will be her third career nomination.

On July 24, at which point “Barbie” was already a box office phenom, Experts ranked Robbie ninth in the Best Actress race. By July 26 she had risen to seventh place. On July 30 she moved up to sixth place. And finally on August 1 she slipped past Natalie Portman (“May December”) to take over fifth position. She still trails front-runner Fantasia Barrino (“The Color Purple”) as well as likely nominees Greta Lee (“Past Lives”), Sandra Huller (“Anatomy of a Fall“), and Annette Bening (“Nyad”).

It would be unusual for an actor to be nominated for a character based on a doll, but Robbie has thoroughly proved her mettle with a previous Best Actress nom for “I, Tonya” (a film she also produced) and a Best Supporting Actress bid for “Bombshell.” And her performance in “Barbie” has been described by critics as “pitch-perfect” and “irresistible.” She “nimbly handles the comedic rhythm of these worlds.” And as with “I, Tonya,” Robbie is also a producer here, which might win her extra points from academy members impressed by her creative achievements in front of and behind the camera.

Of course, it bears repeating that this awards season still has a long, long way to go, and we can’t be entirely sure that the current WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes won’t stretch that season even longer. As it stands, we have yet to see other Best Actress hopefuls like Regina King in “Shirley,” Jessica Lange in “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” and the aforementioned Barrino and Bening. So will Robbie keep rising higher, or will this year’s field of contenders eventually crowd her out?

Margot Robbie recreated her look.","Throughout the years, Mattel has released a slew of Barbie dolls, which Margot Robbie has often referenced in her “Barbie” press tour outfits for the upcoming Greta Gerwig film. Among the iterations of the iconic doll is “Totally Hair” Barbie, which, according to the Guinness World Records, is Mattel’s bestselling Barbie doll to date.

According to the company, the “Totally Hair” Barbie, released in 1992, sold more than 10 million dolls worldwide. The style was designed by Carol Spencer, who talked with Mattel Community Creations about the ideation for the doll in 2017.

“Totally Hair Barbie was an extension of a long career working with hair play, stemming back to the 1960s. It started with Elliot Handler, the founder of Mattel. It was his idea to produce hair-featured dolls,” she told the site.

The “Totally Hair” doll featured ankle-length crimped hair, which aligned with the big and bold hairstyles that were popular in the ’90s. The release also offered a variety of long hairstyles in different textures, with a blond and a brunette Barbie. The doll’s packaging also included a comb and styling gel to encourage people to create spiked, voluminous and versatile hairstyles.

“Totally Hair” Barbie’s outfit was just as bold as her hair, with the doll wearing a multicolor Emilio Pucci-inspired printed minidress. In 2022, Mattel released a revised version of “Totally Hair” Barbie in honor of the 30th anniversary of the doll’s release. The updated version featured a diverse range of hair textures, color-changing clips and 14 other hair accessories.

While promoting the upcoming “Barbie” movie in July, Margot Robbie even channeled the brand’s popular doll. Arriving at the film’s photo call in Mexico City, the star wore a pink Pucci minidress and styled her blond hair into waves.

Robbie collaborated with her stylist Andrew Mukamal, who captioned an Instagram post of her outfit that same month “‘Totally Hair’ 1992.”

The pair, who play Barbie and Ken in the big screen film based on the iconic dolls, appeared side by side in a promotional video shared on Instagram.

'Don't make me look bad in front of the Americans,' the Canadian actor said, pointing to Margot, who is Australian.

'I'm not American!' she replied with a stunned laugh, before giggling at Ryan's mistake.

It was a real-life Ken moment for Ryan, with the doll often portrayed as being a bit of a himbo, or male bimbo.

Margot Robbie was left very amused after her Barbie co-star Ryan Gosling lived up to his goofy onscreen character in a recent interview. Both pictured

'It's the himbo energy. They both radiate it,' joked one person in the comments, with another adding, 'He did not lie he truly has that Kenergy'.

'His Kenergy is off the charts,' said another, while one more commented, 'Ken is Kenning'.

It comes after talk that there could already been a Barbie 2 on the minds of movie executives.

The toy manufacturer's CEO Ynon Kreiz is open to expanding director Greta Gerwig's upcoming blockbuster into a franchise, with early discussions underway.

'Don't make me look bad in front of the Americans,' the Canadian actor said, pointing to Margot, who is Australian. 'I'm not American!' she replied with a stunned laugh

He told Time magazine that there is a possibility of 'more Barbie movies'.

Robbie herself is less certain, noting that while there have been talks, nothing is set in stone.

She explained: 'It could go a million different directions from this point. But I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels.'

The Mattel boss added: 'We're looking to create movies that become cultural events. If you can excite filmmakers like Greta and Noah to embrace the opportunity and have creative freedom, you can have a real impact.'",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjI3NzYyMS9CYXJiaWUtTWFyZ290LVJvYmJpZS1sYXVnaHMtUnlhbi1Hb3NsaW5ncy1yZWFsLWxpZmUtS2VuLW1vbWVudC5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMjc3NjIxL2FtcC9CYXJiaWUtTWFyZ290LVJvYmJpZS1sYXVnaHMtUnlhbi1Hb3NsaW5ncy1yZWFsLWxpZmUtS2VuLW1vbWVudC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,"Down with the patriarchy, up with being your true self. How 'Barbie' packs an unexpected punch.","Director Greta Gerwig and stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more talk movie's sociopolitical messages.","Warning: Minor Barbie spoilers ahead.
You had to figure that once Greta Gerwig, the writer-director behind sharp-witted, class and gender explorations like Frances Ha, Ladybird and Little Women was enlisted to direct Barbie (and co-write it with partner Noah Baumbach, no philistine himself as the filmmaker behind The Squid and the Whale, Marriage Story, etc.), the social commentary would cut far deeper than the inevitable “Barbie dolls are bad for body image” critiques.
Warner Bros. and Mattel’s pink-plastered, star-studded, excessively buzzy $145M blockbuster, though, has been marketed heavily as a broad fish-out-of-water comedy — in this case Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) leave Barbie Land for the real world — a la Will Ferrell’s 2003 holiday favorite. (Ferrell costars in Barbie’s massive ensemble that also includes America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Hari Nef, Kingsley Ben-Adir and Dua Lipa).
Therein lies the film’s Trojan Horse aspect. Or as Gerwig likens it to, a certain type of cocktail.
“It’s like when you order a regular margarita, and then you realize while you’re drinking it that it’s a spicy margarita,” Gerwig tells us during the film’s Los Angeles press day. “That was kind of the way I wanted it to be. But those are the movies I love so much. [The films of] Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges and Howard Hawks. Movies that are soufflés, but there’s a lot underneath them that’s deep, it’s just not presented that way.”
Make no mistake: Barbie is entertaining. And very funny at parts. But it’s also sociopolitical as hell, with the film’s second half (hardly of which any has been shown in the marketing) barreling into a battle of the sexes, pointed takedown of the patriarchy and refutation of gender norms. In one of the film’s most memorable moments, Ferrera (as Mattel employee Gloria who follows Barbie back to her homeland) delivers a searing minutes-long monologue about the complexities, difficulties and double standards women are distinctly forced to face.
“I wasn't exactly sure what the tone of it would be or should be, but I trusted Greta 100 percent to know, in the editing room, what makes sense for the movie,” says Ferrera (Real Women Have Curves, Ugly Betty). “But she gave me so much permission to just play and moment to moment find what it meant for me and what it meant for Gloria. And there are so many versions of it, funny versions, tragic versions. And she picked what she picked.”

As for the Kens, who essentially rise up against the Barbies after Gosling’s dim-witted blond learns about real-life patriarchy, “I think they could easily have become just these walking critiques of like masculinity, in a really heavy handed and preachy way, which by the way, I think they are in some way,” says Liu (Shang-Chi). “But there's something about the Kens where they just don't know what they're doing. And not that that absolves them of responsibility for their actions, but I think it's ultimately a very hopeful place to say, look, the Kens are like children. They're just learning these behaviors because it's what they've been taught… They're not inherently evil. They're not out to get anyone. And it means that anything that can be learned can be unlearned or can be evolved.”
While the film’s feminist layers and gender commentary are likely to draw stronger or passionate reactions (the film is predictably already drawing the ire of conservative politicians for its “woke” messaging), it’s Barbie’s more universal themes that resonated most with the cast.

“You’re good, you are enough. You’re already doing it right,” says Robbie. “Literally, Barbie's mantra is, you can be anything. And Barbie is everything. And that's exhausting. Like, the idea that you can be anything and everything… I find that very overwhelming. So someone saying, ‘You're you and you is great’ is a really nice message, I think.”
“It kind of gives you a way to laugh at yourself, which helps to do that. And it does that in this very entertaining way,” says Gosling. “But somehow when it's over, you feel like something's kind of shifted.”
Adds SNL alum McKinnon, who plays “Weird Barbie,” or the doll that’s been drawn on, had her hair pulled out and has generally been mangled: “Just frickin' be chill, OK? Like, be yourself. Be your whole self. Bring your whole self. Rules be damned. That's the message. And what more poignant message could there be in the world? Come on.”
Barbie opens Friday, July 21.

7/18/2023 23:00,‘Barbie’ Review: Greta Gerwig’s Big Swing Defies the Odds,"Somehow this corporate-led enterprise manages to be original, fun and even a little meaningful","It is, it's important to remember, a toy commercial. But as toy commercials go, it's definitely the best one ever made.
Mattel, the multinational toy manufacturing company, definitely shares authorship on Barbie, the highly anticipated feature film directed by Greta Gerwig, written by Gerwig and her partner in life and art Noah Baumbach and midwived into existence by producer and star Margot Robbie. Strangely, this marriage of art and commerce makes for a compelling movie in original ways.
Assuming you buy the story (and I think most will), you come away from the film itching to buy the product. Barbie dolls are righteous and noble, and the accessories (big-screen representations of actual products) are gorgeous and fun. It's a bold act of blatant advertising, truly bizarre considering how much screen time is given to voice the very real anti-Barbie sentiment that exists in the world. Some of this depends on just how old you are, but I'll simply share that my older sister never had Barbies growing up because our mother thought they were anti-feminist trash.
Nice flex, Ken. Warner Bros. Pictures
Young Ariana Greenblatt plays what I guess you might call a ""woke"" tween (when she calls someone a ""nut job,"" she corrects herself to say ""reality-challenged person""), and she defiantly makes all the familiar talking points about unrealistic body models and the commodification of womanhood. She delivers them to Margot Robbie's ""Stereotypical Barbie"" after the film's star leaves Barbieland and enters The Real World. (I was surprised but not necessarily disappointed in how many plot points Barbie shares with the 2011 live-action movie The Smurfs.)
In Barbieland, everything is kitschily perfect in an #OnBrand way. But whoever is ""playing"" with Robbie's Barbie (shades of the Users in the original Tron, and also Toy Story) has somehow crossed the planes of reality to infect Robbie with flat feet, irrepressible thoughts of death, and, heaven forfend, a smidgen of cellulite. After consulting with Barbieland's oracle — Kate McKinnon's ""Weird Barbie"" (i.e., a toy that has been played with too much, stained with magic marker, and left singed hair and wonky legs) — Barbie must travel to our world to remedy the situation.
The fish-out-of-water sequences (shades of Elf, shades of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home) are a blast but also get to the heart of what makes this movie special. Barbie and her bozo pal Ken (a spectacular Ryan Gosling) stand out in a crowd, and while he loves all the attention, Barbie quickly notices that the attention she's receiving comes with ""an undertone of violence."" The feminist paradise of Barbieland is a stark contrast to the Patriarchy of the real world (and this is discovered in a menacing-but-still-funny way at a construction site during lunch hour.)
Pros
Hilarious performances
Transcendent production design
Surprisingly resonant social commentary
Cons
Not every joke lands
There is no way to deny that this is, indeed, still an ad
Ken, on the other hand, is blown away by Patriarchy (Sly Stallone factors into this more than you might think) and sneaks off to introduce the concept back to Barbieland. And here comes one of Gerwig and Baumbach's key successes. Gosling's Ken (and the other Kens) aren't bad dudes — they are simply overwhelmed by the power Patriarchy holds and how this nefarious system can so quickly brainwash people.
The bulk of the remaining picture is Barbie (with her real-world comrades played by Greenblatt and her mother, America Ferrara) trying to bring balance back to Barbieland. It leads to outfoxing the dopey Kens (there are some ""mansplaining"" jokes in here that kill; there's even a Pavement gag, a recurring Gerwig bone of contention!) that climaxes in a truly terrific choreographed fight-dance between Ryan Gosling, Simu Liu and several other well-accessorized hunks. Along the way, Ferrara delivers a strong monologue summarizing the state of ""being a woman today"" that is sharp and genuine and ought to end up in theater exercises for years to come.
Gerwig packs a lot into this movie. It is the biggest of swings. There are chase scenes, remarkable examples of stagecraft, great original songs and fun uses of storytelling with color, makeup and hair. I would be lying, though, if I said all of it works.
Barbie takes a good while to settle into its groove, and the first 15 minutes, while gorgeous, speed past playful camp to become, in my opinion, annoying. The B-story with Will Ferrell as the head of Mattel racing around to capture Barbie lands with a thud. (Ferrell's connection to the similar Elf and also the character Lord Business in The Lego Movie doesn't help matters here.) Lastly, while Gosling kills it most of the time (hot damn, his big musical number, ""I'm Just Ken,"" co-written by Mark Ronson, is incredible), there's a coda at the end that drags on forever and doesn't even really make sense.
Okay, none of the movie actually makes sense, but that's okay. It's an extremely enjoyable two hours and bonkers enough to aptly be called original, even if it is, at its core, advertising for a product. Moreover, I think many moms and their daughters will love this in a way that is special to them. (Boys and non-binaries absolutely welcome to the party, too.)
I left the screening in a very upbeat mood. But it won't be for everyone. Exiting, I saw the legendary critic, professor, curator and downtown art figure Amy Taubin getting into the elevator. ""Amy,"" I asked, ""were you inspired?"" She looked back at me and spat, ""It's about a f---ing doll!"" 7.7/10

,'Barbie' Review: Doll in Plastic Gets a Greta Gerwig Grounding in Kentastic Postmodern Campy Romp,"Greta Gerwig can really turn anything into gold and give you an existential 
crisis with it. This time gold came in pink.","Barbie's attributes tie to perfectionist constructs in their physical, occupational, and mental states, and the film knows it. So Robbie's Barbie experiences unwanted existential thoughts and body blemishes, along with having the traits of the quintessential Gerwig lead (an average woman with significant self-awareness who wants to find her place in the world), striking a fascinating conflict. While Gerwig has been in her existential bag many times in her prior works, with Barbie, she ambitiously applies a larger-than-life dissertation about Barbie's influence on girls since her inception and with a contemplative attitude. Furthermore, she balances her feminist discussions without blatantly pushing the ""girl boss"" needle too far. Gerwig flirts with it at times, but the consistent self-awareness in the screenplay, cohesive satirical wit, and a standout performance by America Ferrera—whose character Gloria represents the everywoman and has a showstopping monolauge that rivals Saoirse Ronan's WOMEN from Little Women—all prevent its feminist elements from coming across as overbearing and heavy-handed. She finds the sweet spot in commentary discussing women living in a masculine, patriarchal society very straightfoward and silly. Seriously, Ferrera is that cathartic Gerwig mouthpiece—in the everywoman sense not like race, Cc: Sam Levinson—discussing the exhaustion of being a woman, and she delivers it so powerfully it makes you want to get up and salute her. Ferrera is the America I believe in!
The production design and set decoration provided by Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer, respectively, further Gerwig's childlike vision, providing the finest production design this year. In a time when Hollywood's green screen thirst prevails, Greenwood and Spencer double down on pink and practicality. They create large-scale realistic sets that embody Barbie toy sets with plastic-textured objects and backgrounds, and each minute captures that whimsical feeling and imagination of being a young kid playing with Barbies. Gerwig's vision and playing in-depth with scale and scope encapsulates what cinema is all about with incredibly filmed musical sequences and tight choreography that leaves you breathless.
The ""I'm Just Ken"" number is on another wavelength of perfection that harkens to the Grease and Anchors Aweigh days of musical cinema. That was when queer flamboyance and classical masculinity walked hand in hand.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZHlyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXdzL2JhcmJpZS1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-27 15:32:12+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Cut a ‘Fart Opera’ From the Middle of the Movie, Says Greta Gerwig: ‘I Thought It Was Really Funny. That Was Not the Consensus’","Greta Gerwig wanted to have ""a proper fart joke"" in Barbie, but the test screenings did not work in her favor.","If you watched “Barbie” and thought it was missing a proper fart joke, then you might’ve loved one scene that Greta Gerwig and editor Nick Houy left on the cutting room floor. In a new IndieWire interview with the collaborators, it was revealed that “Barbie” had a “fart opera” in the middle of its runtime that got cut because it wasn’t received as well as Gerwig hoped.
“We’ve always tried to get in a proper fart joke and we’ve never done it,” Gerwig said. “We had like a fart opera in the middle [of ‘Barbie’]. I thought it was really funny. And that was not the consensus.”
“It was in the wrong place, too,” Houy added. “We need to work it into a more significant narrative moment next time.”
Houy has been the editor on all of Gerwig’s solo directorial outings, but “Barbie” presented unique challenges.
“[‘Barbie’] was so much more a comedy than ‘Lady Bird’ and ‘Little Women,’” Houy said about opening up more to the test screening process. “So we were just, like, ‘Let’s put it in front of people and see how they react.’ Everyone’s different and every screening’s different and we’ve definitely learned, over the years, that you really have to let things have their fair chance and then act accordingly. Once you know it’s dead, you have got to get it out of there.”
Whatever choices Gerwig and Houy made in the editing room as a result of test screenings appears to have paid off. “Barbie” has earned critical acclaim and is a box office powerhouse, soaring past the $200 million mark at the domestic box office in just five days. Its $162 million opening weekend is the highest ever for a female director.
Head over to IndieWire’s website to read the full interview with Gerwig and Houy on the editing of “Barbie.” The film is now playing in theaters nationwide from Warner Bros.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLWN1dC1mYXJ0LWpva2VzLXRlc3Qtc2NyZWVuaW5ncy1uby1vbmUtbGF1Z2hlZC0xMjM1NjgxNDYxL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLWN1dC1mYXJ0LWpva2VzLXRlc3Qtc2NyZWVuaW5ncy1uby1vbmUtbGF1Z2hlZC0xMjM1NjgxNDYxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,‘Barbie’ Set Visitors High-Fived Ryan Gosling but ‘Wouldn’t Say Anything’ to Margot Robbie: ‘They Just Looked at Her’ and Made Her ‘Self-Conscious’,"Greta Gerwig revealed in a new interview with Rolling Stone that some “Barbie” set visitors made Margot Robbie feel “self-conscious” during filming when they interacted far more with her co-star, Ken actor Ryan Gosling, than they did with her.

Gerwig was talking about the time the crew spent filming a rollerblading scene in Venice Beach. Set photos from the scene, featuring Robbie and Gosling in neon outfits, exploded on social media last summer during production.
“How Barbie operates in Barbieland is she’s entirely continuous with her environment,” Gerwig said. “Even the houses have no walls, because you never need to hide because there’s nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed of. And suddenly finding yourself in the real world and wishing you could hide, that’s the essence of being human. But when we were actually shooting on Venice Beach, with Margot and Ryan in neon rollerblading outfits, it was fascinating because it was actually happening in front of us.”
More from Variety
“People would go by Ryan, high-five him, and say, ‘Awesome, Ryan, you look great!’ And they wouldn’t actually say anything to Margot,” Gerwig said. “They’d just look at her. It was just surreal. In that moment, she did feel self-conscious. And as the director, I wanted to protect her. But I also knew that the scene we were shooting had to be the scene where she felt exposed. And she was exposed, both as a celebrity and as a lady.”
Gerwig added, “To be fair, Ryan was like, ‘I wish I wasn’t wearing this vest.’ But it was a different kind of discomfort.”
The rollerblading outfits became one of the first viral sensations to emerge from the “Barbie” movie. Appearing on “The Tonight Show” last year, Robbie called the photo leaks “mortifying.”
“I can’t tell you how mortified we were, by the way,” Robbie said when host Jimmy Fallon showed the “Barbie” set photo to viewers. “We look like we’re like laughing and having fun, but we’re dying on the inside. Dying. I was like, this is the most humiliating moment of my life.”
When asked if she ever thought the “Barbie” set photos would dominate internet buzz the way they did, Robbie responded, “No! I mean, I knew that we had some exteriors to shoot in L.A. I knew once you were doing exteriors, you’re gonna get papped. There’s probably going to be a little crowd of people who are going to take notice because, you know, we stand out a little bit in those outfits. So I knew there was going to be a little bit of attention, and probably some photos would get out there, but not like it did.”
Robbie concluded, “It was like mad. It was like hundreds of people watching all the time.”
“Barbie” opens in theaters nationwide July 21 from Warner Bros.

The Barbie film’s official Instagram account posted a video showing Gerwig getting surprised during what appears to be a Pilates class as a flash mob of Barbies and Kens pop into the room in honor of the filmmaker turning 40 on Friday. Gosling plays Ken opposite Margot Robbie’s Barbie in the runaway hit that has topped the domestic box office for three straight weekends and on Sunday surpassed $1 billion globally, making it the first live-action movie from a solo female director to reach that feat.
“As Kens know…. Sometimes the only way to express your feelings is through song & dance!” the post’s caption read. The message went on to reference Gosling’s character: “Ken Ryan sent these special Barbies and Kens to start Greta’s birthday with all the feelings!!”
The recording shows a group of Kens performing a dance routine to “I’m Just Ken,” which Gosling sings in the film. Then, a number of Barbies enter the room, and they all team up to strut their stuff to Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night,” another tune that is featured in the movie.
“That was so beautiful!” a delighted Gerwig exclaims at the end. She then asks who sent them and is informed that Gosling came up with the idea. The post tags BookAFlashMob.com, which presumably helped to organize the performers.

As Bullock turned 59 on Wednesday, Reynolds, 46, shared a clip on Instagram from the rom-com showing their much-talked-about nude scene, joking about her birthday gift this year.
""Happy Birthday to the inimitable and stunning Sandra Bullock! For your birthday this year, I got us both intimacy coordinators. And an HR department. And clothing?"" he wrote.
In that Proposal scene, Bullock's Margaret slips while looking for a towel after a shower and falls into Reynolds's Andrew, who just stripped off his clothes after going on a run.
Oscar winner Bullock looked back on the scene while on the About Last Night Podcast with Adam Ray in 2021, saying she felt a sense of ""camaraderie and safety"" filming the scene with Reynolds.

""Ryan and I have known each other since we were prepubescent. We go way, way, way back,"" she said at the time. ""We had to do the naked scene that day and Anne Fletcher, our director who's just incredible, she's great.""
""We had a closed set, which means no one's allowed to be on there, just hair and makeup coming in to fluff and hide,"" recalled Bullock. ""Ryan and I have these flesh-colored things stuck to our privates, my hair is strategically over the nipples and Ryan's little— not little, at all! It's just whatever's there, and I don't know because I didn't see it, I didn't look!""
She continued by explaining that Reynolds's areas were ""stuck wherever it needed to be stuck"" to pull off the sequence, and added, ""When they'd say cut, we couldn't really move. He was on his back with his knees up, and I'm on the floor just sort of resting on his knees, just waiting, and you don't wanna look and we couldn't really move.""
""Then,"" said Bullock, ""I hear Anne Fletcher from the darkness go, 'Ryan, we can see your ball sack!' I'm like, 'Oh God!' because you wanna look down but I'm like, 'Don't look down. Don't look down.' ... Everyone in the darkness spun around to see if they could find a monitor. I was like, 'Anne, there's a way to present that information....' ""

The actress also explained she agreed to do the nude scene ""only if I can be humiliated and funny.""
""You will not see me trying to attempt being sexy naked — in real life or onscreen. There's just no point in it!"" she said. ""It was for that reason, with a friend that you trusted comedically, and safety-wise, I knew I was in the presence of safety.""

On Monday, Reuters reported, according to an official source and the local 24H Algerie news site, that screenings of Barbie in Algeria that began on July 21 have been halted due to claims that the film “promotes homosexuality and other Western deviances,” according to the official source, and violates the country’s religious and cultural values.
Screenings of Barbie have already been barred in Kuwait, even as the tentpole that stars Margot Robbie as the doll icon alongside Ryan Gosling‘s Ken has launched on screens in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain after initial censorship threats and edits.
In Lebanon, which has traditionally been considered among the more liberal countries in the region regarding the LGBTQ community, culture minister Mohammad Mortada said that Barbie “promotes homosexuality” and “contradicts values of faith and morality” by diminishing the importance of the family unit.
Meanwhile, Barbie continues to bedazzle audiences closer to home. The Greta Gerwig-directed film grossed an estimated $33.7 million at the Aug. 11-13 box office in North America — the ninth-biggest fourth weekend of all time — and easily stayed No. 1 as it zoomed past the $500 million mark domestically and $657 million overseas for an impressive global total of $1.18 billion.
Gerwig now ranks as the highest-grossing female director of all time domestically after her movie skated past Frozen II, which was helmed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck.

In February, Lively, 35, and Reynolds, 46, seemingly shared the news of their fourth child with a subtle post on Instagram. The couple and Ryan's mom, Tammy Reynolds, posed for a photo -- and Lively's baby bump was noticeably absent.

Fans first learned Lively was expecting again when she stepped out with a baby bump at the 10th annual Forbes Power Women's Summit in New York City this past September.
Shortly after her bump debut, Lively took to social media with behind-the-scenes photos of her pregnancy to combat paparazzi trying to get a picture at her house. ""Here are photos of me pregnant in real life so the 11 guys waiting outside my home for a 🦄 sighting will leave me alone,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""You freak me and my kids out.

The Greta Gerwigfilm has also become the highest grossing live-action movie directed by a female director and the second-highest grossing release in the history of Warner Bros.. On a global scale, the film has earned $45.1 million USD from 75 markets, bringing its international gross to $657.6 million USD. This is officially the top-earning movie from a female filmmaker, a historic feat for Gerwig.
The film has also surpassed Warner Bros. The Dark Knight Rises and three of the Harry Potter films to make it on the studio's top 10 list of biggest WB titles of all-time internationally. Landing the same day as Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, Barbie has proved to be a the winner in the much-talked about ""Barbenheimer"" debate. Oppenheimer continues to succeed at the box office globally, earning $649 million USD worldwide surpassing Nolan's own Dunkirk.
Both films are considered must-sees in the theaters this summer. Barbie features Margot Robbie and Ryan Reynolds to lead a star-studded cast. Gerwig co-wrote the film with Noah Baumbach and has brought viral moments like the song ""I'm Just Ken"" all over the world.

BARBIE CROSSES $1 BILLION AT THE GLOBAL BOX OFFICE
In its third week of release, the Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling-led film about the world's most famous doll became the second film this year to cross the billion-dollar mark globally. The year's highest-grossing film (so far), 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie', accomplished that feat in April after four weeks.
Barbie makes Gerwig the 29th director, and the first solo female director, to join the billion-dollar club.
The fantasy-comedy has minted $459 million from domestic theaters (the United States and Canada) and $572.1 million overseas, with the total going up to $1.0315 billion, according to Warner Bros. Pictures. The film drew $127 million worldwide this weekend (Friday through Sunday), with $53 million in domestic receipts and another $74 million overseas, according to Comscore data.
The success of Barbie is a major milestone for women in Hollywood. Gerwig is only the fifth woman to ever direct a movie that has grossed over $1 billion worldwide. She is also the first woman to do so with a live-action comedy.

But here we are. Trailers for the upcoming “Barbie,” from director Greta Gerwig and Warner Bros. Pictures, have led to the dissemination of a controversial map used in the film – one depicted in a scene with stars Margot Robbie and Kate McKinnon (known in the film as “Weird Barbie”) — and the studio is speaking up after days of international headlines.
More from Variety
“The map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing,” a spokesperson for the Warner Bros. Film Group told Variety. “The doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the ‘real world.’ It was not intended to make any type of statement.”
The childlike map, with chalk-scribbled dolphins and even a hashtag bobbing around Earth’s vast bodies of water, drew the ire of cinema gatekeepers in Vietnam this week. The drawing depicts what has been called a representation of the “nine dash line,” which reinforces China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea (there are only eight lines in the “Barbie” map, and not in the shape dictated by actual global maps). Vietnam disputes those claims and believes it violates the country’s sovereignty. Officials subsequently pulled the release of “Barbie” in the territory.
But how does the map function in the movie itself? Keeping spoilers at a minimum, Robbie’s Barbie is facing an existential crisis inside the walls of her pink dream world. McKinnon’s Weird Barbie encourages her to go on a journey of self-discovery and provides her with a map to “the Real World,” one made with whimsy by a fellow doll. What some have taken to represent the “nine dash line” is what one source described as “journey lines,” the serial dashes often used in family animation and kid’s drawings to represent where a character has traveled to or from.
Representatives for Gerwig and Warner Bros. would not comment on plot points of the film. Depicted in high resolution above, the map features other so-called “journey lines” as well as arrows and boats. While filmmakers are sensitive to the geopolitical issues raised by the map (issues stoked by Senator Ted Cruz), said the sources, the drawing in “Barbie” is simply the doll’s own road to enlightenment. Momentous buzz and huge marketing spends around the film have seemed to escalate everything it touches, from debating the Ken doll’s age to creating a CGI-perfect foot arch.
“I’m not sure this map, which you’d miss if you blinked at the one-minute mark in the third trailer, is admissible in the International Court of Justice. It’s cartoonishly unrealistic,” wrote Toronto Sun columnist Vinay Menon on Wednesday. “Where is continental Europe? New Zealand? What do the sailboats represent? Is that a jester’s crown atop Iceland?”
“Barbie” also stars Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Will Ferrell, Hari Nef, Issa Rae and Simu Liu. It hits North American theaters on July 21.

Some lucky folks have gotten an early look at Greta Gerwig's life in plastic, and according to them, it's fantastic. The highly anticipated ""Barbie"" movie held its Los Angeles premiere on Sunday, and the first social media reactions were quite strong. Jamie Jirak from Comicbook.com tweeted that it's ""currently my favorite film of the year,"" adding, ""Give Ryan Gosling an Oscar nomination, I'm dead serious!"" The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan also said ""admiringly"" that he ""can't believe Greta Gerwig got away with it,"" while Variety's Katcy Stephan said the director ""delivers a nuanced commentary on what it means to be a woman in a whimsical, wonderful and laugh-out-loud funny romp."" Collider's Perri Nemiroff was more mixed, though, saying it ""isn't the home run I was hoping for"" because some of the characters needed more screen time to have fully developed arcs. So we'll lower our expectations slightly and merely expect one of the greatest films of all time rather than the greatest.

2. Hugh Jackman finally wears the yellow Wolverine suit in ""Deadpool 3""
Yellow suits him. Ryan Reynolds has dropped a new look at ""Deadpool 3"" that reveals Hugh Jackman finally wearing Wolverine's classic yellow suit. This look from the comics and animated series has become iconic, but Wolverine never put it on in the prior ""X-Men"" films. The 2000 ""X-Men"" movie even included a meta joke about it where Wolverine complains about his suit before Cyclops sarcastically asks, ""What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?"" Well, a lot of fans legitimately would, so for years, there were calls for a more comics accurate appearance. Over two decades later, Jackman is now putting on the yellow spandex for real, though in the photo, he's not wearing the mask that would complete the look. This follows news that Jennifer Garner will be in ""Deadpool 3,"" reprising her role of Elektra from the critically reviled films ""Daredevil"" and ""Elektra."" It's a reminder that in Hollywood, wait long enough and even the worst movies ever made will transform into nostalgic, underrated gems.

3. Rainn Wilson was ""mostly unhappy"" for years on ""The Office""
For Rainn Wilson, working on ""The Office"" was sometimes like working in an actual office: deeply depressing. ""When I was [on] 'The Office,' I spent several years really mostly unhappy because it wasn't enough,"" the actor revealed on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast. Wilson, who played Dwight on the NBC sitcom, recalled how even though he was ""making lots of money"" starring on a hit, award-winning show, he ""wasn't enjoying it"" because he was ""thinking about, 'Why am I not a movie star? Why am I not the next Jack Black or the next Will Ferrell, and how come I can't have a movie career?'"" He also wanted to be making millions of dollars rather than hundreds of thousands of dollars. But Wilson reflected that this kind of ""never enough"" impulse is ""one of the things ripping us apart"" as a society. Wise words from a former assistant regional manager.

According to Deadline, she will appear in a ""handful of episodes"" of the third season but will depart after that. It was fairly shocking news considering Leighton is one of the main characters and a major fan favorite. While no official reason for her departure was disclosed, an insider told Page Six that Rapp announced she'd be going on tour in September ""without having clearance from the show,"" and she has now reportedly hired a top lawyer to help with her exit. ""[Kaling] has to figure out what happens to Renée's character,"" the insider also told Page Six. ""This is not the way anyone would have wanted [Rapp's exit] to happen.""

2023-08-15 21:53:35+00:00,"Some Wannabe Ken Actors Took Their Shirts Off During ‘Barbie’ Auditions; Casting Directors Told Them: ‘No, You Don’t Need’ to Do That",Barbie casting director had to advice potential Ken actors not to take their shirts off during auditions.,"“Barbie” co-casting directors Allison Jones and Lucy Bevan revealed to the MPA’s “The Credits” series that several wannabe Ken actors took off their shirts during the audition process thinking showing off their bodies was a total Ken move. Any actor auditioning for the role of Ken’s arch-rival Ken (a role that ultimately went to Simu Liu) auditioned with the now-beloved “beach off” fight scene.
“Those scenes were fun to audition,” Bevan said. “Some of the Kens would take off their T-shirts, and we were like, no, no, you don’t need to take off your T-shirt. But Simu [Liu] just nailed that [line] in the film.”
“The thing that Greta did always stress was that none of these people were sarcastic or winking at the camera. They were really Kens and Barbies,” Jones added.
“There were certain scenes we used to audition, and the fine line between the comedy and sincerity of those characters is a difficult balance,” Bevan continued.
The Ken roles in the film went to the likes of Ryan Gosling, Liu, Scott Evans, Ncuti Gatwa and Kingsley Ben-Adir. The casting directors revealed last month that “Saturday Night Live” Emmy nominee Bowen Yang, “Schitt’s Creek” Emmy winner Dan Levy and “Dear Evan Hansen” Tony winner Ben Platt were all in the running to play versions of Ken in the film, but scheduling logistics prevented the castings from happening. Jonathan Groff also circled the role of Ken’s long-suffering friend Allan before Michael Cera landed the part.
“It’s rather a boring reason, actually,” Bevan reiterated to the MPA about why certain actors got dropped. “On a movie like this, it was a hugely ambitious shoot and a complicated schedule, and you can have brilliant ideas, and people’s availability either does or doesn’t work.”

2023-08-08 14:59:43+00:00,'Barbie' Sets Release in Middle East After Potential Ban,"""Barbie"" will play in theaters across the Middle East after all.","“Barbie” will play in theaters across the Middle East after all.
Greta Gerwig’s billion-dollar blockbuster was running into censorship issues in certain territories, including in the region’s top market of Saudi Arabia, so it looked increasingly like the film would be banned. But those matters appear to have been resolved, as the movie is set to release on Thursday.
“Barbie” was originally scheduled to debut in the Middle East on July 19, two days before landing in the rest of the world’s multiplexes. However, the release date was pushed back to Aug. 31 (before it was moved ahead to Aug. 10) after local censors suggested edits allegedly pertaining to LGBTQ-related narration and dialogue in “Barbie.”
Movies that concern or contain sex, homosexuality and religious issues are routinely cut in the Middle East to comply with censorship rules. If a studio is unwilling to make the adjustments suggested by censors, the films are banned from playing in theaters. Most recently, Sony’s summer blockbuster “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” was not approved for release in Saudi and the UAE likely because of a scene that featured a “Protect Trans Lives” flag.
It is unclear if Warner Bros. and Mattel, the companies behind “Barbie,” complied with the proposed cuts to the film about the iconic Western doll. In the past, straight-to-video adaptations of “Barbie” were banned in Saudi Arabia due to the portrayal of women in non-traditional gender roles.
“Barbie,” starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, has already generated $1.03 billion at the global box office, including $468 million in North America.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9maWxtL25ld3MvYmFyYmllLXRoZWF0cmljYWwtcmVsZWFzZS1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1wb3RlbnRpYWwtYmFuLTEyMzU2OTA3OTEv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9iYXJiaWUtdGhlYXRyaWNhbC1yZWxlYXNlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LXBvdGVudGlhbC1iYW4tMTIzNTY5MDc5MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Original ‘Barbie’ Writer Exited Sony’s Failed Movie Because ‘They Wanted a Girl-Boss Feminist Twist on Barbie’ and ‘That’s Not What Barbie Is’,"When Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie’s “Barbie” finally opens in theaters later this month, it will mark the end of a long, long journey to get the iconic Mattel doll to the big screen.

Sony Pictures originally had the rights to Barbie and spent years trying to get a movie off the ground. Actors such as Amy Schumer and Anne Hathaway came and went. Schumer said last month that she exited her “Barbie” movie because the script wasn’t “feminist and cool” enough.
Another talent that left “Barbie” during the film’s development at Sony was Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “Juno.” She exited the film in 2018 and told ScreenCrush at the time, “I was literally incapable of turning in a ‘Barbie’ draft. God knows I tried.”
More from Variety
Why was “Barbie” so hard to crack for an Oscar-winning talent? Cody reflected on the failed project in a new interview with GQ magazine.
“I think I know why I shit the bed,” Cody said. “When I was first hired for this, I don’t think the culture had not embraced the femme or the bimbo as valid feminist archetypes yet. If you look up ‘Barbie’ on TikTok you’ll find this wonderful subculture that celebrates the feminine, but in 2014, taking this skinny blonde white doll and making her into a heroine was a tall order.”
Sony’s plan to pair Cody’s idiosyncratic writing style with a crass comedian like Schumer didn’t work, the writer remembered. “That idea of an anti-Barbie made a lot of sense given the feminist rhetoric of 10 years ago,” Cody said. “I didn’t really have the freedom then to write something that was faithful to the iconography; they wanted a girl-boss feminist twist on Barbie, and I couldn’t figure it out because that’s not what Barbie is.”
Cody also said “The Lego Movie” loomed large over the development of Sony’s “Barbie” movie. The 2014 animated comedy was a massive critical and commercial hit for Warner Bros., grossing $468 million worldwide and landing Oscar nominations for best animated feature and best original song. “The Lego Movie” took a brilliant meta approach to bringing toys to the big screen, and Sony wanted to emulate that for Barbie.
“I heard endless references to ‘The Lego Movie’ in development,” Cody told GQ magazine, “and it created a problem for me because they had done it so well. Any time I came up with something meta, it was too much like what they had done. It was a roadblock for me, but now enough time has passed that they can just cast [‘The Lego Movie’ antagonist] Will Ferrell as the antagonist in a real-life Barbie movie and nobody cares.”
Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” opens in theaters nationwide July 21.

These include drama series Bang from Joio and Artists Studio, Petrol Head (Welsh title Pen Patrol) from Rondo, Red Wall (Y Wal Goch) from Afanti, Wrexham Our Club (Wrecsam Clwb Ni) from Wildflame, Vets (Y Fets) from Boom and Gareth Bale: Living the Dream (Gareth Bale: Bwy’r Freuddwyd) from Burn Media.
Reynolds is the owner of Welsh football club Wrexham FC along with Rob McElhenny. The pair oversaw a promotion from the National League into the English Football League for the first time in well over a decade in the recent 2022/23 season. A doc following the team, Welcome to Wrexham, has been a hit on FX and Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally.
Today, he and McElhenny were unveiled among the new investors of Formula 1 team Alpine.
“Ryan Reynolds is our adopted Welshman and his respect, understanding and commitment to Wrexham and Wales is unquestionable,” said Llinos Griffin-Williams, S4C Chief Content Officer.
“Together with Ryan and the Maximum Effort team we have curated a slate of exciting shows for a global audience, Ryan understands the importance of Welsh culture and the language and has fallen in love with Wales and the Welsh people.”
She added: “This commercial deal will take Welsh language content to Hollywood and the world. It will benefit the entire creative sector and talent pool here in Wales as we showcase everything from S4C dramas to entertainment formats, documentaries and sport. We’re a small nation that punches well above our weight.”
UK Government Media Minister John Whittingdale said: “International interest in Welsh culture, language and talent has never been higher. It is great to hear that thanks to this new partnership, and with the help of Ryan Reynolds, millions of people across the US will be able to experience the very best TV shows from S4C.”

Check out his remuneration and growth over the years.,"Ryan Gosling is one of those heartthrobs who can easily make you skip a heartbeat! The actor started out very young. In fact, as a child artist. And from that child artist to Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, he has certainly come a long way! From Mickey Mouse to Ken, the actor has certainly grown in every aspect and the world has witnessed this success along with him. He has starred in a wide range of films, from critically acclaimed indie dramas to big-budget blockbusters. His career has spanned over two decades, and he has shown no signs of slowing down.
Gosling got his start in show business as a child actor on the Disney Channel’s The Mickey Mouse Club. He appeared on the show from 1993 to 1995 and quickly became a fan favorite. After The Mickey Mouse Club, Gosling went on to star in several television shows, including Breaker High and Young Hercules. His film career began in 2001 with the release of The Believer but he shot to fame with the 2004 film The Notebook.
But do you know how much he was paid for his TV series and then Notebook? Well, Ryan Gosling started young in 1993 with The Mickey Mouse Club and as reported by Cosmopolitan, the actor was paid $135 per week for his gig. He shot for 13 weeks and earned $1755 as his first salary. Later he was paid $1 million for The Notebook! However, his growth as an actor always pushed his digits on his paychecks to get bigger and better. He was paid $7 Million for The Nice Guys and $ 10 Million for Blade Runner in 2017.
His salary for Barbie would surprise you, considering his net worth has reached around $70 Million. According to reports, the actor has been paid $12.5 Million for the Margot Robbie starrer multi-million film. From $1755 in 1993 for his TV gig to 12.5 million, that is a jump of 712,150.71 times over the course of 29 years which is an incredible growth rate! However, wait till you hear this.
According to a report in Man’s World, the actor has surpassed this number before and has taken a cut in his salary for Barbie! He was paid $20 Million for the Netflix film The Gray Man, also starring Chris Evans. Actually, his growth from Mickey Mouse to The Gray Man has been 11,395,011.4%.! That is how you define success.
Ryan Gosling has shown great range in his career. He has starred in a wide variety of films and has always brought his unique charisma and charm to each role. He is currently set to star in the upcoming film Barbie, where he will play Ken, the iconic male counterpart to Barbie. The film is scheduled to be released On July 21, 2023.

,Pat Sajak Called It! Departing 'Wheel of Fortune' Host Joked Show Had Ryan Seacrest 'on Speed Dial' Years Ago,Ryan Seacrest will take over for the retiring Pat Sajak as host of 'Wheel of Fortune' after the show’s upcoming 41st season,"Pat Sajak has long suspected Ryan Seacrest had a good shot at becoming the next Wheel of Fortune host.
After Tuesday’s announcement that Seacrest would be his successor, a 2012 clip from the game show resurfaced online in which the longtime host joked that the American Idol host was only a call away.
In the video, a contestant asked for a vowel and the host responded, 'You spun the wheel, you have to ask for a consonant.”
Sajak, 76, quickly realized his error and corrected himself, saying, 'Oh wait, you spun a free play, I'm an idiot. You see the way it works is if you land… Nevermind. Is there an 'E' in the puzzle?'
He ran into trouble again later in the episode when another contestant spun and landed on a trip to Arizona. After asking for an 'N' Sajak admitted that he was “not sure” if that letter was in the puzzle.
After the contestant picked up the piece for the trip, Sajak joked, “Seacrest is on speed dial.”

Sajak’s remark came more than a decade before Seacrest, 48, was named his replacement on Wheel of Fortune. Through his multi-year deal with the popular game show, the former Live with Kelly and Ryan co-host will also serve as a consulting producer, Sony Pictures Television announced on Tuesday.

Addressing his hiring, Seacrest said he's ""truly humbled to be stepping into the footsteps of the legendary Pat Sajak.""
""I can say, along with the rest of America, that it’s been a privilege and pure joy to watch Pat and Vanna on our television screens for an unprecedented 40 years, making us smile every night and feel right at home with them,"" Seacrest said in a statement. ""Pat, I love the way you’ve always celebrated the contestants and made viewers at home feel at ease. I look forward to learning everything I can from you during this transition.""
""Many people probably don’t know this but one of my first jobs was hosting a little game show called Click for Merv Griffin 25 years ago so this is truly a full circle moment for me and I’m grateful to Sony for the opportunity,"" he added. ""I can’t wait to continue the tradition of spinning the wheel and working alongside the great Vanna White.""

Following the announcement, Sajak — who revealed on June 12 that he will leave Wheel of Fortune after season 41 — shared a supportive message on Twitter.
""I'm looking forward to my final season starting this fall, and then handing over the car keys to Ryan Seacrest in September of 2024,"" wrote the TV personality.

2023-07-26 19:30:00+00:00,'Barbie' Was a Marketing Masterpiece. Here's Why.,"'Barbie' reportedly had a $150 million marketing budget, and it exceeded that figure in its opening weekend. Here's how it did that.","'Barbie' reportedly had a $150 million marketing budget, and it exceeded that figure in its opening weekend. Here's how their marketing team pulled it off.
Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Barbie, the iconic doll that has captured the hearts of millions worldwide for over six decades, was created by businesswoman Ruth Handler, the co-founder of Mattel.
Barbie was inspired by Ruth's observation that her daughter enjoyed playing with paper dolls representing adult women. Ruth envisioned a three-dimensional adult-like doll that would empower girls to imagine and role-play different professions and aspirations.
The first Barbie doll debuted at the American International Toy Fair on March 9, 1959, in New York City, instantly gaining popularity and sparking a cultural phenomenon.
Over the years, Barbie has evolved to embrace diversity, representing various ethnicities, professions and body types while remaining a symbol of inspiration, creativity and limitless possibilities for generations of children worldwide.

'Barbie' debuted on July 21, 2023, to a historic $162 million opening weekend domestically, coming in way ahead of the anticipated $90 million to $110 million and, perhaps even more remarkably, surpassing its $146 million production budget.
But that's not why you're here. You're here because you've got your marketing hat on and are wondering, ""Is marketing important when launching a product or a service?""
'Barbie' reportedly had a $150 million marketing budget. Here's the breakdown of some of the marketing campaigns:
A website to make custom 'Barbie' posters.
Progressive insurance partnership.
Airbnb partnership to create a life-size replica of Barbie's Malibu dreamhouse.
Burger King collaboration on a pink burger.
While the essence of a great film lies in its storytelling, there's no denying the impact of marketing in propelling a movie to phenomenal success. The marketing plan for 'Barbie' definitely paid off because 'Barbie' had the biggest opening weekend of 2023 at the US box office.
In the fiercely competitive world of filmmaking, creating a successful movie requires much more than just a compelling script and talented actors.
Over the years, several films have demonstrated the art of investing heavily in marketing to achieve box office triumphs and leave an indelible mark on pop culture. Let's explore some of these movies that became cinematic juggernauts by strategically investing in their marketing campaigns.

1. Avatar (2009)
James Cameron's groundbreaking sci-fi epic, ""Avatar,"" took the world by storm and revolutionized how movies were made and experienced. With an estimated budget of $237 million, the film's marketing campaign spared no expense. Avatar couldn't rely on brand (franchise) recognition to sell tickets, so it came up with an innovative promotional strategy:
Imax 3-D screening of the film on 130 screens (16 nonsequential minutes) to raise awareness about the new 3-D technology for four months before the film's debut.
A video game trailer.
Mattel action figure set.
Partnerships with McDonald's, Coke, LG and Panasonic.
The efforts paid off as ""Avatar"" became the highest-grossing movie ever, earning over $2.8 billion worldwide.

2. The Avengers (2012)
Marvel Studios' ""The Avengers"" was a cinematic event that brought together Earth's mightiest heroes in a colossal ensemble spectacle. Marvel's marketing team meticulously laid the groundwork for this epic team-up, starting with individual character films like ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America"" and ""Thor.""
Marvel orchestrated a 5-year marketing plan by planting seeds for the all-star ""The Avengers"" movie in its preceding global hits:
Iron Man (2008) - gross revenue of $585 Million
Thor (2011) - gross revenue of $449 Million
Captain America (2011) - gross revenue of $370 Million
If even one of the prior films had flopped, it is likely that ""The Avengers"" film would not have happened. The result? ""The Avengers"" became the first film to gross over $1 billion without the help of a re-release.

3. ""Jurassic World"" (2015)
Revisiting the beloved ""Jurassic Park"" franchise after a long hiatus was risky. Universal Pictures, however, made sure ""Jurassic World"" was a roaring success. With a substantial marketing budget, the studio launched a nostalgia-driven campaign that honored the original while presenting fresh, exhilarating content:
JurassicWorld.com — designed like a park, including an interactive map, camera installations and digital tour of attractions.
Jurassic World Youtube channel — corporate/educational videos about the park's staff, videos by Simon Masrani, park founder, on the park philosophy, and collaborations between lead actor Chriss Pratt and prominent YouTube channels.
Shazaam app partnership — turned posters into dynamic content.
The film's marketing campaign paid off spectacularly, becoming the first movie to gross over $500 million worldwide in its opening weekend.
4. ""Deadpool"" (2016)
""Deadpool"" defied conventional superhero movie norms by embracing its R-rated nature and quirky humor. Ryan Reynolds, who played the titular character, played a significant role in the film's marketing success. He actively engaged with fans on social media, shared witty promotional material, and even took part in offbeat marketing stunts, like posing as a faux bear for a Russian travel show. Some of the unconventional marketing campaigns:
The Emoji Billboard - AdWeek described the billboard as ""So Stupid It's Genius.""
Valentine's Day prank - jokingly released as a romantic comedy.
Marketing on Tinder - users would match with Deadpool on the dating app.
3 Hours of Ads - Spike, MTV, and VH1 advertised nothing but Deadpool for 3 hours straight.
The unconventional approach worked wonders, and ""Deadpool"" became the highest-grossing R-rated film ever.
The success of these movies is a testament to the power of marketing in the entertainment industry. By wisely investing in strategic and innovative promotional campaigns, studios were able to capture audiences' imaginations and generate unparalleled box office returns. Beyond their compelling stories and visual splendor, these films are shining examples of how marketing can elevate a movie from merely successful to a cultural phenomenon.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vZ3Jvd2luZy1hLWJ1c2luZXNzL2JhcmJpZS13YXMtYS1tYXJrZXRpbmctbWFzdGVycGllY2UtaGVyZXMtd2h5LzQ1NjMzOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

More from Variety
Fans can officially rent the Malibu Barbie dream house on Airbnb, as hosted by Barbie’s right-hand man, Ken (played by Ryan Gosling). He’s trading in his rollerblades and surf shorts to offer fans a one-of-a-kind experience this July at the life-sized, toy-inspired mansion, proving he’s more than “Just Ken.”
On July 17 at 10 a.m. PT, everyone in Barbie Land can request to book Ken’s room in Barbie’s DreamHouse at airbnb.com/kendreamhouse for two individual one-night stays for up to two guests. Selected winners will stay at the pink mansion in Malibu on July 21 and July 22, free of charge, to indulge in all the Kenergy that revamped beach home has the offer.
“We all have dreams, and Barbie is lucky enough to have a house full of them,” said Ken via press release. “But now, it’s my turn, and I can’t wait to host guests inside this one-of-a-kind – dare I say, one-of-a-Ken? – digs.”
The newly renovated Malibu dream house sports Barbie’s signature pink polish, this time with a revamped Kenergy. Upon their stay, guests will indulge in the opportunity to look through Ken’s wardrobe, learn line dancing on the outdoor disco floor, engage in a “beach off” by the infinity pool and take home an exclusive piece of the Kendom with a set of yellow-and-pink Impala skates and surfboards.
Ken’s hosting commemorates the July 21 release of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” written by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. The film will star Margot Robbie, Gosling, America Ferrara, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell.

,Big Nothing. — WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,,"Chores, People.
I’ve been self-employed most of my life. It’s a blessing, I guess. There were years where I made no money and self-employment felt a lot like doing nothing but with a very active brain. Actively telling me I’m doing nothing but sometimes writing something down trying to make sense of the world and myself. Myself outside of doing nothing is very active mentally.
Lately, perhaps because I own a house, doing nothing is actually very busy. I guess I need to redefine nothing. That’s a life’s journey. Food shopping, cooking, laundry, refilling bird feeders, fixing a gate, playing records, playing guitar, watching old movies, watching old comedy, reading news, reading not news, sex, sleep, watching reels, making and drinking coffee, etc. These aren’t nothing. These are a full-time job. All of these take up space in my brain while some other part of my brain is crunching the soul numbers and working existential equations. That sentence would be an example of that work.
Listening to Blue Mitchell right now while wondering if my cat’s kidneys are failing while dreading tomorrow. Spinning the plates. A lot going on in this big nothing. It’s the work.
I think there’s a rat in my basement. I think that’s why the cats are acting weird. I set one trap down there and I don’t check it enough. There was one decaying down there a couple weeks ago. I think they sense when there’s one around. Or maybe I’m just too focused on them. When you get too focused on the cats with some kind of concern I think they get nervous because you are and it’s a vicious cycle that only ends when you take them to the vet to hopefully be told nothing is wrong. Which is most of the time. I think that’s a good amount of a vet’s business. People freaking out about their animals which eventually freaks the animals out and the vet stops the insanity for part of their living.
I saw the Barbie movie and I have big feels about it on many levels. I talk about it on today’s show but it may not be as clear as this text exchange I had with a woman I know:
Her: Barbie was so boring and unfunny. I don’t get it.
Me: I thought it was a masterpiece.
Me: I definitely got the feels and some laughs.
Me: Progressive Cultural Trojan Horse.
Her: Maybe I should watch it again. I think TikTok really had me expecting something different
Me: It’s brilliant.
Me: I mean, if you didn’t get it, you didn’t get it.
Me: I don’t think seeing it again will make a difference.
Her: I think it’s that it was feminism 101 and I was expecting feminism 500. But the visuals were amazing and Ryan Reynolds and Kate McKinnon gave great performances. I just wanted it to do too much.
Me: Who cares what feminism it was. It’s there and it’s thorough. Millions of young girls are going to see it. It has a lot of heart. Totally entertaining. It’s a full on entertainment product seeped in progressive politics. That’s a big lift. It’s fucking genius. I thought some of the gags and jokes were solid. Totally unique vision. Tremendous accomplishment.
Me: The way it handled men was truly inspired comedy.
Me: I was lit up the whole time. Proud of it for some reason.
Reading it now I see I may have mansplained Barbie a bit but I was excited. Also, Ryan Reynolds isn’t in the movie. I knew what she meant though. Gosling.
I’ve been watching a lot of old Don Rickles and listening to a lot of old punk rock. It’s not nostalgia, it’s nourishment. I guess I’m creatively craving some fuck you energy. I guess I’m worried I’ve lost some of my fuck you-ness. I’ll get it back.
Today I have a truly lovely chat with Melissa Villaseñor who I was concerned may not talk much. She did. On Thursday I talk to Gary Mule Deer who was at The Comedy Store when it opened and had a very interesting, long career in the showbiz racket.
Enjoy!
Boomer, Monkey and LaFonda live!

The previous record at Warner Bros. was held by none other than Christopher Nolan Batman sequel, The Dark Knight, which earned $24.6 million (not adjusted for inflation).
Barbie’s haul becomes the 13th biggest Monday of all time, surpassing Jurassic World’s $25.3 million (not adjusted for inflation). It also becomes the highest Monday tally for a female director.
Barbie is coming off a stellar opening weekend of $162 million domestically, besting Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which opened to an impressive $82.4 million. Barbie surpassed The Super Mario Bros. ($146 million) for the highest opening of 2023, and Gerwig now owns the record for the biggest opening of all time by a female director.
Overall, Barbie’s domestic gross is $188 million and should pass $200 million on Tuesday. Combined with an international gross of $194.3 million, Barbie’s global box office gross is a stellar $382 million.
What to Expect in Barbie?
Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, who leaves Barbieland in favor of the “real world” after a crisis of faith leads her to question her existence. Joining Barbie on the journey is Ryan Gosling’s Ken, Barbie’s boyfriend.
“After being expelled from Barbieland for being a less-than-perfect doll, Barbie sets off to the real world to find true happiness,” the official synopsis reads.
Barbie features a large ensemble cast, including America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Ncuti Gatwa, Rhea Perlman, Dua Lipa, Emma Mackey, Ariana Greenblatt, Michael Cera, and Will Ferrell.

,Hide your cats: Ryan Reynolds is bringing back ALF,Ryan Reynolds is bringing ALF back on his Maximum Fun Channel this weekend.,"Everyone's favorite centuries-old, wisecracking alien life form — a short list, to be sure — has chartered a flying saucer from the '80s to today. Thanks to Ryan Reynolds' Maximum Effort, ALF is back on Earth.
No, it's not an Oppenheimer tie-in with that episode where ALF tries to convince the U.S. president to end its nuclear program lest Earth suffer the same fate as his home planet of Melmac. The oddball NBC sitcom will return on Reynolds' Maximum Effort Channel on Saturday, July 29.
ALF. Ryan Reynolds/YouTube
The reprise, through a partnership between Reynolds, ALF creator Paul Fusco, and the recently rebranded Shout! Studios, will not consist of full-length episodes. Instead, the channel will air old ALF episodes alongside ALF-centric shorts highlighting brands like Mint Mobile and Hims.
""At Maximum Effort, we love taking risks and blurring the lines between shows and sponsorship because we believe both can be equally entertaining,"" Reynolds said. ""Besides my irrational love of ALF growing up, one of the reasons we licensed this show was precisely because Paul, Shout! Studios, and our intrepid brand partners wanted to plot with us to bring ALF back to life.""
The well-coiffed puppet, performed by Fusco, starred on ALF from 1986 to 1990. The hit sitcom centered around a family that takes in the alien (and hides him from nosy neighbors and government agencies) after he crash-lands in their garage.
Maximum Effort's marathon, dubbed the ALF ""Caturday"" Marathon because of the alien's famous hunger for cats, will feature ALF episodes, the ALF-starring sponsored content, and Maximum Effort's Podcats: The Pawdcast. The channel is available through Fubo, Amazon Freevee, LG Channels, Plex, Sling Freestream, Tubi, VIDAA, VIZIO Watchfree+, and Xumo Play.
This isn't the first time ALF's enduring cult following has prompted the puppet's return to TV. The Melmac native starred in TV Land's short-lived ALF's Hit Talk Show in 2004, an interview series featuring guests like Drew Carey, Bryan Cranston, and Tom Green. ALF also made an unexpected appearance in a bizarre episode of Mr. Robot.

As revealed in a new Time magazine cover story on the making of “Barbie”: “The shot took eight takes. [Margot Robbie] had to hold onto a bar to keep her feet flexed. And, yes, those are her feet. ‘I really don’t like it when someone else does my hands or feet in an insert shot,’ she says.”
More from Variety
Robbie also told Time that she would’ve turned down “Barbie” had Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s script not incorporated many different Barbie characters. Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Hari Nef, Dua Lipa and more actors also play Barbie in the Warner Bros. tentpole.
“If [Mattel] hadn’t made that change to have a multiplicity of Barbies, I don’t think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film,” Robbie said. “I don’t think you should say, ‘This is the one version of what Barbie is and that’s what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.’”
Robbie explained to Vogue last month that she also courted Gal Gadot to star as a Barbie in the movie since she feels like the Wonder Woman actor embodies “Barbie energy.”
What exactly is Barbie energy? “Gal Gadot is Barbie energy,” Robbie said. “Because Gal Gadot is so impossibly beautiful, but you don’t hate her for being that beautiful because she’s so genuinely sincere, and she’s so enthusiastically kind, that it’s almost dorky. It’s like right before being a dork.”
In playing the main Barbie character herself, Robbie also had to sort through questions regarding beauty and sexiness. After all, Barbie is a children’s doll.
“I’m like, ‘Okay, she’s a doll. She’s a plastic doll. She doesn’t have organs. If she doesn’t have organs, she doesn’t have reproductive organs. If she doesn’t have reproductive organs, would she even feel sexual desire?’ No, I don’t think she could,” Robbie said. “She is sexualized. But she should never be sexy. People can project sex onto her. Yes, she can wear a short skirt, but because it’s fun and pink. Not because she wanted you to see her butt.”
“Barbie” opens in theaters nationwide July 21 from Warner Bros.

2023-07-19 09:16:05+00:00,More movies based on toys in the works after 'Barbie',"""Barbie"" won't be the last film based on a popular toy, as Mattel is planning a whole cinematic universe with movies based on Hot Wheels, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and more.","Hollywood may soon be taken over by a new MCU: the Mattel Cinematic Universe.
The highly anticipated ""Barbie"" film looks set to become one of the biggest hits of the summer after generating a surprising amount of hype for a movie based on a toy. If it's as big as box office analysts expect, a whole wave of toy-based movies could move full steam ahead, and according to The New Yorker, Mattel alone has a whopping 45 of them in various stages of development.
But can any of these projects be nearly as successful as ""Barbie,"" ""Transformers,"" or ""The Lego Movie,"" or is there a limit to Hollywood's ability to create hit films out of products with virtually no story attached? We'll find out soon enough, but these are some of the most notable — and slightly ridiculous — upcoming movies based on toys:

Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots
Vin Diesel is teaming up with Mattel Films and Universal for a live-action movie based on Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, which will follow a ""father and son who form an unlikely bond with an advanced war machine,"" Deadline reported in 2021. Diesel is set to produce and star, while ""Rampage"" co-writer Ryan Engle reportedly penned the screenplay.
""To take the classic Rock 'Em Sock 'Em game, with Mattel as my partner, and align it with the kind of world-building, franchise-making success we have had with Universal is truly exciting,"" Diesel said, while Mattel Films producer Robbie Brenner promised it will be a ""thrilling action adventure for the whole family to enjoy.""
Hot Wheels
A live-action movie based on Hot Wheels has been in the works since 2019, and in 2022, Mattel confirmed that J.J. Abrams' production company Bad Robot will produce. Mattel described it as a ""high-throttle action film,"" and according to The New Yorker, Abrams said, ""For a long time, we were talking to Mattel about Hot Wheels, and we couldn't quite find the thing that clicked, that made it worthy of what Hot Wheels — that title — deserved. Then we came up with something … emotional and grounded and gritty.""
American Girl
If ""Barbie"" is a hit, could Mattel find similar success with a movie based on American Girl dolls? It was a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, but it could become a reality, as a live-action American Girl movie has been in the works at MGM since 2019. ""American Girl is a beloved, story-driven franchise lending itself perfectly to a feature film,"" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said.
View-Master
A live-action movie based on the View-Master toy is somehow also happening at MGM. Jonathan Glickman, MGM motion picture group president, said in 2019, ""We couldn't be more excited to partner with Mattel to create a family adventure integrating the old school turn and click stereotypic device with the modern world of virtual reality."" The project had been in some stage of development going back to 2009.
Polly Pocket
""Girls"" creator Lena Dunham will write and direct a live-action Polly Pocket movie for Mattel with Lily Collins set to star. It will ""center on a young girl and a pocket-sized woman who form a friendship,"" according to Variety. ""I'm so thrilled to bring to bear both my love of this historic property and also my deep-seated belief that young women need smart playful films that speak to them without condescension,"" Dunham said. She also told The Hollywood Reporter the film will have a ""lot of fun with the idea of what happens when a small person encounters a big world.""
Magic 8 Ball
Yes, even Magic 8 Ball is being turned into a movie — and a horror movie, no less. In 2019, Deadline reported that Blumhouse was teaming with Mattel for a film based on Magic 8 Ball with Jeff Wadlow (""Truth or Dare"") attached to direct. ""This iconic toy has a built-in connection with fans and untapped potential for storytelling,"" Mattel said at the time. By 2022, Blumhouse was no longer involved. But as of July 2023, The New Yorker reported that the film is still in the works from ""Cocaine Bear"" screenwriter Jimmy Warden.
Chatty Cathy and Betsy Wetsy
Jason Bateman's Aggregate Films is teaming with Mattel for movies based on the dolls Chatty Cathy and Betsy Wetsy, Variety reported in 2022.
Masters of the Universe
A live-action ""Masters of the Universe"" movie was in the works at Netflix with Adam and Aaron Nee, the filmmakers behind ""The Lost City,"" set to direct. But according to Variety, the film recently fell apart due to budget concerns. Mattel is reportedly shopping the project and seeking a new buyer.
Major Matt Mason
Paramount announced a live-action movie based on Mattel's Major Matt Mason, the 1960s astronaut toy reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear, in 2019. Tom Hanks is set to star, and as of 2019, ""The Da Vinci Code"" screenwriter Akiva Goldsman was set to adapt the script from a short story from Michael Chabon, according to Variety.
Clue
The board game Clue already spawned a 1985 comedy, but a new version is in the works with Ryan Reynolds attached. This one, though, is a Hasbro property. Marvel vs. DC was so 2010s, so strap in for an even greater battle in the 2020s: the Mattel Cinematic Universe vs. the Hasbro Cinematic Universe.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS9icmllZmluZy8xMDI1MDgwL21vcmUtbW92aWVzLWJhc2VkLW9uLXRveXMtaW4tdGhlLXdvcmtzLWFmdGVyLWJhcmJpZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

2023-07-21 03:40:17+00:00,An Unlikely Movie Marathon: ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ but They’re Both Worth Watching,"Watching these movies alongside one another can weirdly make you appreciate the other, writes movie reviewer Laura Bennett.","Whether you call it “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” the mega marathon afforded by two of the biggest movies of the year coming out in the same week is seismic for reasons beyond the combined star power of the two releases.
It’s doubtful many will really embark on an almost five-hour cinema binge (plus trailers) to watch the two back-to-back but between them significant ideas – with great cultural consequences – are right there ready for dissection.
Barbie would be the one to watch first, so let’s start there.
Introducing us to Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) in Barbieland, Barbie is a pink-saturated world of perfection until its main character starts to develop “symptoms” of the real world like cellulite, flat feet and an awareness of death.
Seeking out wisdom from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) – a doll bearing the jagged haircut and Texta marks of a toy who’s been “played with too hard” by its human owner – Barbie ventures out into the real world to understand the source of her dark emotions.
It would be easy to write-off Barbie as purely a marketing stunt for Mattel and a thinly veiled feminine manifesto, but despite the mixed reviews it’s received, Barbie is an extremely clever consideration of how men and women find identity in proximity to each other, and the conflicting messages women get about who they’re supposed to be in society.
Hope 103.2 is proudly supported by
Yes, being Barbieland, Barbie initially anchors “perfect realty” in one where women are at the helm, but Ken’s comedic journey of displacement (played masterfully by Ryan Gosling) actually serves to highlight why a world with only one gender holding complete power wouldn’t be ideal – no matter which way it fell.
At a superficial level, Barbie holds to its PG-rating but if you want to peel back a few layers of the pink there’s great depth in the writing of director Greta Gerwig and husband Noah Baumbach.
Once you leave the land of pink, it’s a sharp left into the World War II era, with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
Based on the theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons – namely those that dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 – Oppenheimer traces the rise of this controversial scientist and how he ushered in The Atomic Age.
The brilliance of Oppenheimer’s mind is contrasted with his uncertainties about the consequences of what they’re creating, which at one point he realises his team can make but “can’t control how it’s used.”
You may be watching a biopic about one man but the movie speaks broadly to weapons manufacturing and where the responsibility of their impact lies. It’s reminiscent of the “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” rhetoric justifying firearm proliferation.
Cillian Murphy (Inception, The Dark Knight) will no doubt be a shoo-in for an Oscar for his incredible portrayal of Oppenheimer, and Christopher Nolan (Tenet, Dunkirk) could easily get one for best director. Then there’s Robert Downey Jr. who’s brilliant as a support actor in the role of Louis Strauss giving us the lingering line that “genius is no guarantee of wisdom”.
Watching Oppenheimer alongside Barbie is an usual pairing, but weirdly one can make you appreciate the other.
Having watched Barbie, you notice how much of Oppenheimer is spent watching men talk in rooms – which isn’t a slight, just a reality of the story and the truth of when it was set.
There is a female scientist on Oppenheimer’s team, but the guys are concerned about the possible impacts exposure to radioactive material may have on her reproductive system, and don’t know what to do when she claps back saying hers is “less exposed” than theirs. And let’s be honest, they were all doing highly risky stuff they didn’t entirely comprehend.
After seeing the drama of Oppenheimer, you relish Barbie and how considered colour and comedy can be, and that “fun” can also be a pathway to epiphanies.
Whether watched over a day or a weekend, Barbie and Oppenheimer are both worth the big screen experience and, while targeted at entirely different audiences, drive home ideas that affect all of us.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaG9wZTEwMzIuY29tLmF1L3N0b3JpZXMvY3VsdHVyZS9tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXdzLzIwMjMvdW5saWtlbHktbW92aWUtbWFyYXRob24tYmFyYmllLWFuZC1vcHBlbmhlaW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Sources confirmed the pause with Deadline yesterday. The Marvel pic is the biggest project to date to be halted by the strike. We’ve reached out to Marvel for comment.
The news comes just a few days after Ryan Reynolds shared a first look at the return of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine return in Deadpool 3 on his Instagram stories. In the pic, Reynolds can be seen walking with a super-suited Wolverine in black and yellow.
Jackman joins the Deadpool franchise after portraying the adamantium-clawed mutant in nine films from 2000 to 2017, spanning from X-Men to Logan. The first look emerged on the heels of news that Jennifer Garner will likewise make a Marvel return as Elektra after playing the character in 2003’s Daredevil. Shawn Levy is directing and producing the Marvel threequel. Plot details remain under wraps. The script was written by Reynolds, Levy, Paul Wernick, Rhett Reese, and Zeb Wells. Emma Corrin and Matthew Macfadyen join the franchise as newcomers, as Karan Soni, Leslie Uggams, Morena Baccarin, Stefan Kapicic, Rob Delaney, Brianna Hildebrand, and Shioli Kutsuna return.
Levy and Reynolds are producing the film alongside Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige. The pic was last moved up on Disney’s release schedule from November 8 to May 3, 2024, as several other MCU titles saw their dates pushed amid the WGA strike.
SAG-AFTRA members are expected on the pickets early Friday morning. Union President Fran Drescher will be on the picket lines Friday on the first day of the guild’s strike against the film and television industry. She’ll be joined by Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the guild’s national executive director and chief negotiator, and members of the guild’s negotiating committee. Drescher and her team will be picketing outside Netflix’s offices in Los Angeles in the morning from 9-9:40, followed by picketing outside the gates of Paramount Studios from 10-10:40 and then over to Warner Bros. in Burbank from 11:10-11:45 and Disney from noon to 12:45.

2023-08-17 17:42:59+04:00,"Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling to reunite for ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ prequel",Movie to be directed by Jay Roach will be set in Monte Carlo: Reports,"After their amazing chemistry in Greta Gerwig’s $1 billion-grosser ‘Barbie’, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are gearing up to reunite for an ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ prequel. The duo will don completely new avatars after their feel-good fantasy comedy.
According to Collider, director Jay Roach has a very vivid vision for his currently untitled ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ prequel. He is in fact inspired by Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller films, and will go old school with its filmmaking techniques as it will be set in Monte Carlo in 1962.
Next to nothing has been revealed about the film, though Roach has said that he aims to capture the same on-screen presence of Robbie and Gosling which they showcased in ‘Barbie’, except this time it will be darker, more grounded and a lot more cynical.
Roach told Collider: “Originally, there were some questions about whether it would be weird to have (Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling) together again after ‘Barbie’.”
“But I think there’s just some pairings you want to see over and over again. It’s such a powerful, powerful duo, you know? And it’s the suspense of will they come together; will they trust each other enough to team up? That’s romantic,” he added.
The prequel will aim to tie up its storyline with director Steven Soderbergh’s classic 2001 ‘Ocean’s Eleven’, which starred George Clooney as Danny Ocean, an ex-convict fresh out of prison who reunites with old partner in crime Rusty, portrayed by Brad Pitt for a witty but dangerous heist to steal millions from Las Vegas casinos. Romance rarely figures in Ocean’s movies, but there is a love story in this prequel apparently.
The production has not yet started, because while it was expected to begin in France, on June 30, 2023, the Hollywood writers and actors strikes have paralysed work, while giving a release date is currently out of the question.

Robbie to earn $50 million for ‘Barbie’
Actress Margot Robbie is being richly rewarded for her role in director Greta-Gerwig’s $1-billion (Dh3.67 billion) blockbuster ‘Barbie’, as she is expected to earn over $50 million (Dh183.65 million) in salary and box office bonuses. This means, her royalties for the movie are even greater than her co-stars due to her also being a producer for the film.
According to Variety, Greta Gerwig will also likely receive bonuses because of the film’s outsize success. ‘Barbie’ had earned $526.3 million (Dh1,933.12 million) at the US box office since its opening, and then earned over $657.6 million (Dh2,415.39 million) at the international box office.
In addition to bringing the popular children’s toy line to life, Robbie produced the film through her production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, which she founded in 2014 with her now-husband, Tom Ackerley, and friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. The goal of the company was to tell women’s stories on screen and support women creators behind the scenes.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaG9sbHl3b29kL21hcmdvdC1yb2JiaWUtcnlhbi1nb3NsaW5nLXRvLXJldW5pdGUtZm9yLW9jZWFucy1lbGV2ZW4tcHJlcXVlbC0xLjk3NTczNjg50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,Blake Lively Jokes Her Trainer Is Not the Father of Her and Ryan Reynolds' Kids After Posting Bikini Pic,The 'Gossip Girl' star reacted to a fan who commented on her recent bikini pic.,"Blake Lively is cheekily giving props to her personal trainer, Don Saladino. On Thursday, the Gossip Girl star posted a photo of herself in a red bikini, which she paired with heart-shaped sunglasses.
""K now im gonna draw it with AI… 😍 🍼 🍼 Uncanny,"" she captioned the photo of her summer style.
However, it was her reaction to one fan's comment that has people talking. ""How have you had 4 kids??? 🔥🔥🔥,"" one of her Instagram followers asked.
Lively jokingly responded by calling out Saladino, writing, ""@donsaladino Wait. No. That’s not how. He’s not the father. He’s just the one who helps me fit into (some of) my clothes again after. He’s an even better person and friend than trainer. And that’s saying a lot. ♥️""
Instagram
The 35-year-old actress shares four children with 46-year-old actor Ryan Reynolds, daughters James, 8, Inez, 6, Betty, 3, and a newborn fourth baby.
In January while still pregnant, Lively also made a joke at Saladino's expense while showing off her baby bump.
""Been doing @donsaladino's workout program for months now. Something isn’t working,"" the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star quipped. In the post, Lively and her trainer are seen posing before a workout prior to her pregnancy, while in another pic from another day, she's seen baring her growing belly while with child.

Did Margot Robbie pitch Barbie as billion-dollar project?
During a conversation with Collider, Robbie was asked what helped convince Mattel and Warner Brothers to agree to the script and allow them creative control for her vision. The actress replied, ""I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they're brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director. And then I gave a series of examples like, 'dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg,' that and that.""
""Pretty much naming anything that's been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years. And I was like, 'And now you've got Barbie and Greta Gerwig.' And I think I told them that it'd make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?!"" she added. When the conversation steered towards the iconic film franchise Jurassic Park, Robbie asked, ""Well, it's kind of true. Can you imagine that first meeting?""
""They're like, 'Dinosaurs? I don't know, I mean, yeah? That might turn out kind of silly.' And then here we are decades later being like, 'That's the greatest movie ever.'"" the Harley Quinn star concluded. As per early projections, Barbie is expected to have an opening weekend in the $95 million to $110 million range, while some analysts even believe it could touch the $140 million mark. The film has to compete with Christopher Nolan's thriller Oppenheimer.

,Why People Are Dressing Up To See The Barbie Movie,"Fashion is one of the main tools people are using to channel their excitement for the film, and nostalgia for the decades-old toy that’s both celebrated and villainized for its representations of womanhood.","The phenomenon also means that people are revisiting their love for the toy.

There are also more choices, given the wide range of dolls Mattel has released in recent years after pushes for diversity in the Barbie universe. “I just really feel like they've really made a Barbie for every single person that would want one,” says Smith. In turn, the Barbie stereotype is being challenged as more people choose to rethink their relationship with the doll through fashion. “People are so focused on what Barbie looks like and not on what she's doing and I think that really says a lot,” says Layla. “I think it’s so amazing that Barbie has taken on so many roles and you’re able to see yourself in Barbie.” Astronaut Barbie.

Margot Robbie looks adorable in unearthed childhood snaps - decades before she would star in 2023's biggest blockbuster,Here is a look at the star as a young girl growing up in Australia. The 33-year-old actress plays the title role of Barbie opposite Ryan Reynolds as her beau Ken. The film opened on Friday.,"Advertisement
Margot Robbie's big-budgeted and highly anticipated summer movie Barbie was released on Friday.
The 33-year-old actress plays the title role of the Mattel wonder opposite Ryan Reynolds as her beau Ken in a live-action movie directed by Greta Gerwig.
Barbie dolls are usually purchased for girls anywhere from toddler age to tweens with some even holding on to the plastic princess way into their teenaged years.
DailyMail.com has unearthed rare photos of Robbie when she was the age when most girls collect Barbie and all her add-ons like her pink convertible, pets, bicycle and dreamy Malibu beach house.
In photos that have hardly ever been published, Margot appears to be a sweet young kid with thick bangs and a wide smile who is ready for adventure.

She sure is a beauty: Here the actress is seen in her Western look from the movie directed by Greta Gerwig
The movie star was born Margot Elise Robbie on July 2, 1990.
The plucky actress seemed to have a very normal upbringing in Australia.
She did not grow up in a big city but rather in the country in Dalby, Queensland. Dalby is a rural town in the Western Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. The population of Dalby is about 15,000 people.
Her father Doug Robbie was a farm-owner and sugarcane tycoon. Her educated mother was Sarie Kessler, a physiotherapist.
Little Margot was far from an only child as she had siblings. They are Anya, Lachlan and Cameron.
But crisis hit the family early on as her parents split up with the future A list movie star was only five-years-old.
After the marriage crumbled, the kids lived with their mother Sarie at a Gold Coast farm owned by one of their grandparents. The farm was called Currumbin Valley.
Margot did not see much of her dad after the split.
Robbie thrived anyhow as she became athletic learning gymnastics.
It has been claimed that her mother entered her in the circus as a trapeze artist after having received a certificate at age eight.

But soon acting came calling for the cheerful blonde. While still in high school she appeared in two small budget films: Vigilante and I.C.U.
She studied drama at Somerset College where she first honed her skills.
But money was not easy when she was at college and she had to work odd jobs to pay for the basics.
At one point she lived off tips as a bartender and also took to cleaning houses for extra cash.
It has been claimed that she also made sandwiches at a Subway chain.
After she graduated from Somerset she went into acting in Melbourne, picking up commercials to get by.
Her home town: Dalby is a rural town in the Western Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. The population of Dalby is about 15,000 people
With mama: Here she made a rare appearance with her mother Sarie at the 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awards in 2018
She made her television debut in a 2008 guest role as Caitlin Brentford in the drama series City Homicide and followed this with a two-episode arc in the children's television series The Elephant Princess, in which she starred alongside Liam Hemsworth but her first big hit was Neighbours in 2008. She was on the show until 2011.
Next came Hollywood. She got a small role on Pan Am (2011) then was in the movie About Time (2013).
Robbie's breakthrough came with Martin Scorsese's 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.
She played the beautiful wife of Jordan Belfort, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Her sex scenes with the actor were considered wild, and left her fans with wanting more from her.
Next came Focus with Will Smith, The Legend Of Tarzan (2016), Suicide Squad (2016), I, Tonya (2017), Terminal (2018), and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (2019) to name a few.
Bombshell (2019), Birds Of Prey (2020), Amsterdam (2022) and Baby;on (2022) followed. Her last film was Asteroid City.
While promoting her new Barbie movie Margot said she really never played with dolls as a kid.

She said she was not into playing indoors with toys as she was more of a 'roll-around-in-the-mud kind of gal' though her sister and cousins did have the dolls.
When asked about her memories of playing with Barbie dolls, she said, 'I didn't personally have any that I can recall.'
But when she did play with dolls they were not picture perfect.
'I think they were all so janky because they were not well cared for. They were all weird Barbies,' she added.
And on Thursday she shed some light on what kind of kid she was.
She has hilariously revealed how she faked her own death to get back at the babysitter she was having issues with as a young girl.
The siren revealed during an interview conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike on BBC 2 that she once smeared ketchup on her body and lay next to a kitchen knife after a conflict with a new babysitter she wasn't liking all that much.
Robbie waited 45 minutes to be discovered by the nanny - but said it was all worth to watch her run out of the house, screaming.
'We got a new babysitter,' Margot recalled during an interview with BBC Radio 2. 'And I wanted my old babysitter back, Talia, who was like 16 and I thought she was so cool. And then we got this much older lady in and I was just not happy about it.'
'She told me to go have a bath and I didn't want to, and she was very cranky and I thought, ""I'm going to show you.""

'And so I got a big kitchen knife and the ketchup and I lay sprawled out naked on the tiles, covered myself in ketchup and put the kitchen knife.
'And I waited for like 45 minutes for her to find me. But, it was worth the wait.'
'Did she run screaming from the house?' interviewer Zoe Ball asked.
'Oh yeah,' she replied.
'You produced your own death,' Ryan Gosling chimed in. 'I did,' Margot replied.
The star also recalled another time she scared people as a child - so much the ambulance was even called.
'I also once practiced like a pratfall on the cinema stairs at the shopping center where I'm from,' she said. 'People started calling an ambulance so, I guess I was a bit of a dramatic child.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTIzMjE1ODEvQmFieS1CYXJiaWUtTWFyZ290LVJvYmJpZS1sb29rcy1hZG9yYWJsZS11bmVhcnRoZWQtY2hpbGRob29kLXNuYXBzLWRlY2FkZXMtc3Rhci0yMDIzcy1iaWdnZXN0LWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLmh0bWzSAakBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMzIxNTgxL2FtcC9CYWJ5LUJhcmJpZS1NYXJnb3QtUm9iYmllLWxvb2tzLWFkb3JhYmxlLXVuZWFydGhlZC1jaGlsZGhvb2Qtc25hcHMtZGVjYWRlcy1zdGFyLTIwMjNzLWJpZ2dlc3QtYmxvY2tidXN0ZXIuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
7/12/2023 14:47,Last night's Oppenheimer premiere could be the only red carpet for the film if actors join writers on strike,,"As we’ve mentioned a few times now in today’s posts, the deadline for the producers and the actors to reach a new deal is tonight. And if that doesn’t happen, the actors have already decided to join the writers on strike. Sarah just wrote in the previous post about Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool that a strike means no filming and no promoting. So it’s possible that last night’s Oppenheimer premiere in Paris will be the only red carpet for this film. Barbie’s European premiere will be in London tonight.
Oppenheimer isn’t like Barbie in terms of red carpet visuals, obviously. But like Barbie there’s a high-profile ensemble cast. That’s also why it’s kinda fun that they’re going head-to-head at the box office. Because it’s kinda like Avengers Civil War with these two movies. For every A-lister in Barbie, Oppenheimer has a corresponding star. I saw Oppenheimer last week and it felt like every five minutes there was another Oscar winner up on screen.
Barbie’s ensemble revolves around Margot Robbie. Oppenheimer’s ensemble revolves around Cillian Murphy and he is really, really f-cking good in the lead role. And he has to be, because Oppenheimer is a character study. It’s a film about the race to nuclear armament but it’s also the portrait of the man at the core of the American effort to build the bomb and J Robert Oppenheimer was a complicated man – brilliant, charming, infuriating, often obtuse and insensitive, selfish too, and also deeply principled. Over the course of three hours, Cillian Murphy brings out all those sides of him, it’s an extraordinary performance, and as I said yesterday, it seems almost certain that he’ll get a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this role.
That said, early reaction out of Paris where Oscar buzz is concerned is, surprisingly (at least to me), focused on Robert Downey Jr. Sarah will have a full review of Oppenheimer next week before its release so for now, all I’ll say is that while RDJ is good in the film, the section of the film which focuses on his relationship with Oppenheimer (the third act) is actually, in my opinion, the weakest. Still, this is strong work from him – and with this kind of buzz, there’s no doubt they’ll be building an Oscar campaign around him for Best Supporting Actor. And I hope they do the same for Emily Blunt because when she gets her moment in this film, it is something to see.
So here they are, Cillian, RDJ, and Emily with Matt Damon and Christopher Nolan in Paris on what is perhaps their only red carpet together unless a strike is somehow averted. Matt had all four of his daughters with him for the occasion.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhaW5leWdvc3NpcC5jb20vbGFzdC1uaWdodHMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcHJlbWllcmUtY291bGQtYmUtb25seS1yZWQtY2FycGV0LWlmLWFjdG9ycy1qb2luLXdyaXRlcnMtb24tc3RyaWtlLzc0NDA20gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhaW5leWdvc3NpcC5jb20vbGFzdC1uaWdodHMtb3BwZW5oZWltZXItcHJlbWllcmUtY291bGQtYmUtb25seS1yZWQtY2FycGV0LWlmLWFjdG9ycy1qb2luLXdyaXRlcnMtb24tc3RyaWtlLzc0NDA2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-21 11:00:44.736000-04:00,"The Best Ryan Gosling Movies, Ranked","Ryan Gosling is both a heartthrob and a serious actor capable of playing tortured men, silent heroes, and wounded lovers with real emotion. We take a look at his best and worst movies, including his latest role as Ken in Barbie.","Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: FilmDistrict, Focus Features, Lionsgate, MGM, New Line Cinema, THINKFilm, Universal Pictures, Warner Bros Pictures
For a few years there, Ryan Gosling’s status as the internet’s No. 1 boyfriend threatened to overshadow his presence as an actor. The stillness, the composure, the sly self-awareness, and the bursts of rancor that he’s used to bounce between psychological thrillers and romantic dramas, buddy comedies and big-budget sci-fi sequels, were being flattened by fans into a cute (but limiting) “Hey girl” memeification. Yes, the Canadian former Mickey Mouse Clubber is handsome and charming, and there’s nothing wrong in pointing that out. (We are not immune; we’re even going to talk about his looks in this list!) But over more than 20 years onscreen, he’s also cultivated a fascinating malleability that made him a worthy agonized heir to Harrison Ford in Blade Runner 2049, the only good white man to listen to jazz in La La Land, and a perfect foil to an eye-rolling Russell Crowe in The Nice Guys. He may just be Ken, but he’s not just Ken, you know?
Gosling’s career can be roughly chopped into phases: the tortured young men of The Believer and Stay, the singular and silent heroes of his partnership with Nicolas Winding Refn, the wounded lovers of his work with Derek Cianfrance, the cerebral and heartbroken guy in Song to Song and First Man. Across genres, his roles share a kind of idealistic yearning to be seen and to be known that Gosling conveys with those soft eyes and a tired half-smile. He’s been nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actor — although, in traditional Oscars fashion, not exactly for his best roles — but he’s also had some duds (a very kind way to describe the existential headache of The Gray Man). We discuss those extremes in this complete ranking of Gosling’s theatrically released movie roles, meaning his work in TV isn’t included. Our apologies to the legions of Frankenstein and Me fans, but here are our assessments of Gosling’s other performances, listed from worst to best.
Oof. On paper, Gosling’s turn as a CIA operative named Six who is entrusted with protecting a tween girl from an unhinged assassin should be, if not amazing, at least watchable. There’s connective tissue between his character here and his PI Holland March, responsible for a headstrong daughter, in The Nice Guys, and to be fair, Gosling’s chemistry with Julia Butters (the scene-stealer from Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood) is solid. But outside of their relationship, Six is so glib and so slick that Gosling is almost doing a Ryan Reynolds impression, and the movie’s action — which could show off another element of Gosling’s physicality — is so choppily edited that it’s impossible to get a sense of his bodily grace. He’s not the right fit, and overall, the Russo brothers’ movie is not a good time.
Terrence Malick has made many gorgeously layered, distinctly evocative films, but Song to Song isn’t one of them. This narratively thin work almost feels like a Malick caricature, what with all the endless voice-over, shots of men kneeling apologetically before women, and romantic melodrama between characters played by Rooney Mara, Michael Fassbender, Natalie Portman, and Gosling. As BV, the musician in love with Mara’s Faye, who’s cheating on him with Fassbender’s record producer Cook, Gosling has barely anything to do. He gets in some little moments that seem unscripted — a giant smile watching a bird select paper slips from a box, a believably furrowed brow while working on an oil rig — but he has the least dialogue out of all four main characters, and the movie’s too abstract to make any meaningful use of him. Plus, Malick denies us a Dead Man’s Bones reunion, a majorly missed opportunity to reignite Gosling’s music career of singing silly, spooky songs like “My Body’s a Zombie for You.”
Gosling’s roles tend to organize themselves into slightly connected pairs, and this indie movie starring Gosling as a high-school football player struggling to figure out his future comes a couple years after Gosling starred in another high-school-football movie, Remember the Titans. In The Slaughter Rule, athlete Gosling faces off against coach David Morse in an overly plotted story about football as masculine expression, and that masculine expression as a stand-in for masculine desire. Morse is electric as the closeted, somewhat cruel bully Gideon to Gosling’s trying-to-please Roy, and The Slaughter Rule is beautifully shot, with directors Alex Smith and Andrew J. Smith taking full advantage of their Montana location. The pacing is uneven, though, and sometimes Gosling’s fragility is broad when it needs to be precise. It’s an acceptable early performance, but it also feels young in Gosling’s understanding of himself as an actor.
23. The United States of Leland (2003)
Gosling cycled through a few “disturbed young man capable of a shocking act” roles early in his career, with The Believer, The United States of Leland, and Stay all drawing from that well. Of those three, The United States of Leland is probably his flattest attempt. As Leland, a teen who kills his ex-girlfriend’s developmentally disabled brother, Gosling mostly stays blank and vacant; his unwavering reticence is required by Matthew Ryan Hoge’s script, which relies on a final reveal to justify its existence. It’s not entirely Gosling’s fault that the character is more irritating than compelling, and he holds his own in scenes with Don Cheadle as a teacher who considers writing about Leland. (A post–Twin Peaks Sherilyn Fenn and young Michael Peña are absolute casting coups.) But Leland is ultimately too clichéd for Gosling to do much with.
22. All Good Things (2010)
It’s impossible to tell exactly when Gosling started doing his De Niro–esque New York accent; its slow creep into his voice has been going on for a while. But All Good Things is probably when it’s felt most appropriate, since Gosling plays a Manhattan real-estate heir (and Robert Durst analog) accused of killing his wife (Kirsten Dunst). He nails the voice, and he nails the movie’s big emotional asks — a scene in therapy where he screams his guts out, a tear when confronted by his father about his poor business skills. But the movie never quite grows out from its ripped-from-the-headlines roots, and the script’s character-development gaps in how it alters Gosling’s David from a peculiar but besotted husband into a hair-triggered murderer make his performance feel a little overstretched, too.
21. Stay (2005)
David Benioff wrote 25th Hour (great), Troy (good), and then Stay, this nearly impenetrable psychological thriller that plays out like The Machinist through a David Lynch filter. Championed by Roger Ebert but ultimately a box-office flop, Stay’s plotting is far too tedious and the characters played by Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts too vague for any of it to gel. But then there’s the scene in which Gosling’s character weeps in the middle of a strip club while women dance to Massive Attack’s “Angel” — it’s a real “What’s happening here, and do I care?” viewing experience. Still, Gosling is serviceable as a young man who hears voices, puts out cigarettes on his arm, and tells his psychiatrist (McGregor) that he’s going to kill himself. It’s not nearly as raw or visceral a performance as his work four years earlier as a live-wire neo-Nazi in The Believer, but that’s because the movie surrounding him isn’t as good.
Look, we are judging performances here, not the movies themselves, okay? Gangster Squad had the ugly uncanny-valley aesthetic of a Sin City knockoff, a too-big ensemble, and overly slow-mo-dependent action scenes. That all unfortunately overshadows the palpable affection Gosling and Emma Stone have in their second of three movie romances, and even Gosling’s playboy charisma gets dulled a bit. The actor has played men with strict moral codes and ruthless tactics many times throughout his career, and this just isn’t the best version of that. But he stands out for his dry line deliveries (“Well, you gotta die someday” is wonderfully blasé) and the genuinely fatigued affect he brings to his World War II veteran and cop, and, hey, he looks great. There’s a moment where his otherwise lacquered hair gets sweaty and falls over his forehead as he points a shotgun at a baddie, and it’s very satisfying!
Emotionally manipulative, arguably inaccurate, and thoroughly pleasant, Remember the Titans is one of the better entries in the “civil-rights history through sports movies” cinematic trend, and that’s because Denzel Washington is Denzel Washington–ing all over the place. He’s got gravitas, he’s giving tough love. And while Gosling isn’t in this much — he’s really just a supporting player to Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris, and Donald Faison and Ethan Suplee were both more recognizable young actors at the time — he’s goofy and open in a way that reflects his Mickey Mouse Club training and lays the groundwork for his later singing and dancing in La La Land and Barbie. The locker-room scene in which he sings along to “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” is almost cringingly earnest, but Gosling gives himself over to it completely, and that lack of artifice is a nice reminder of the looseness he’s capable of.
18. Fracture (2007)
It is a cinematic rite of passage for up-and-coming white actors to play lawyers or law students, and Gosling joined the ranks of Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon with Fracture. It’s a fairly by-the-numbers legal thriller, with Gosling’s district attorney Beachum prosecuting Anthony Hopkins’s engineer Crawford for attempted murder and getting caught up in the man’s mind games and manipulation. Gosling does well in this role, though, because he’s an engaged scene partner with Hopkins (watch how absorbed and frustrated he is when they’re in the courtroom together) and because he excels at playing obsessive figures driven by a single-minded purpose, which Beachum becomes when Crawford is acquitted. Gosling hasn’t played that many good-guy law-enforcement roles where the character he’s embodying isn’t swayed into ruthlessness or recklessness, and Fracture remains something of an outlier in his filmography. It’s familiarly plotted, sure, but efficiently acted.
Yes, yes, the Photoshopped abs. We’re all aware of the most memorable line from Dan Fogelman’s script. Kudos to Gosling, though, for making the skinny-suit-wearing womanizer Jacob more than just an exceptionally sculpted torso. He’s scathing in his scenes with Steve Carell as hopeless near-divorcé Cal, all exasperated sighs, mirthful giggles, and disgusted body language; his comedic timing is on point. There’s also the sense, as the years have passed, that this role is the nexus for a number of quirks that Gosling would bring to his later roles, and even his public persona. His repulsed, step-back-and-stare reaction to Cal’s velcro wallet is a precursor to his exaggerated enmity toward Simu Liu’s other Ken in Barbie; he covers a laugh with his left hand in the Crazy, Stupid, Love trailer and onstage at the Oscars. Gosling is clearly having fun, and while a solid half of this movie is a drag, he’s at least entertaining himself (and us).
Nicolas Winding Refn’s second collaboration with Gosling could have been goofy as hell. To be honest, it sort of is: all Freudian mommy issues, mythological meandering, and the most atmospheric bisexual lighting you’ve ever seen. But it’s also a testament to Gosling’s star power that he can anchor a film this unbelievably weird and brutal and keep us mesmerized throughout. The long sequence in which Gosling, playing American expat and Bangkok crime boss Julian, unbuttons his cuffs, pushes up his sleeves, circles around Thai police lieutenant Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), and challenges him to a brawl with a direct-to-camera “Wanna fight?” might be the hardest the actor has ever looked. The fact that he then gets his ass thoroughly kicked by Chang embodies not just Refn’s grim sense of humor, but also Gosling’s willingness to get as dirty and demeaned as a role requires. And that’s even before Julian cuts open his mother’s corpse and shoves his hand inside of it to feel close to her for the first time in his life! What other actor could make that moment pitiable, even understandable?
“You exude something. You draw people in,” Paul Giamatti’s Tom says to Gosling’s Stephen in The Ides of March, George Clooney’s political drama, and duh, he’s right. Released during Obama’s first term, this movie’s cynicism didn’t go over super-well; the film’s negative reviews were particularly hard on the idea that maybe Democrats and Republicans can both be bad. That realization, though, is key to Stephen’s curdling idealism in the film, a moral collapse that Gosling gives urgency and despondency. Gosling sells both sides of the character. First, he’s a political-operative hotshot totally sure of his own supremacy and fully confident that sleeping with a college student on the campaign trail won’t affect his career at all; how often Gosling looks at Evan Rachel Wood’s lips when she’s talking is, frankly, very hot, and he deftly conveys Stephen’s easy professional and personal confidence. His turn into villainy is trickier, yet Gosling hardens his voice and his gaze and successfully spars with the murderer’s row of Giamatti, Clooney, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film’s bookended auditorium scenes, and how they center Gosling’s transformed character, are a thoughtful touch.
Gosling is fantastic at being irritated. His voice gets clipped, his face gets tight, and his inflections go to unpredictable places, like the staccato edge he gives to “money” as Deutsche Bank salesman Jared Vennett in Adam McKay’s film. A simplified read of this performance would be to say it’s Gosling cosplaying as Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross, and sure, he’s doing a fast-talking finance-bro thing. Gosling lightens it up with moments of dorkiness, though — a juvenile fist pump in the gym after a major sale, a stanky face when he shows off his $47 million check at the end of the film — that bring the performance closest to the point The Big Short makes about the 2007 housing-market crash and how it was created by people with too much money and privilege and too little oversight or consequence. Every member of this ensemble (Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, Christian Bale) does their part, but Gosling’s tone is most right for McKay’s specific style of satire.
13. Murder by Numbers (2002)
Remember when we used to make fun movies about little freaks? Murder by Numbers is an entertainingly nasty thriller about two high-schoolers, popular Richard (Gosling) and introverted Justin (Michael Pitt), who plan the perfect murder and frame a local drug dealer for it. When Sandra Bullock’s detective is assigned the case, she immediately suspects Richard, whose entitled attitude reminds her of an abusive man from her past. Gosling’s a proper asshole, a know-it-all brat with pique and smarm to spare; his layers of duplicity here will make you long for him to try on another fully villainous role. In his best moments with Pitt, they embody a teen-drama version of Matt Damon and Jude Law’s relationship in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and I know that’s very high praise. It’s also deserved.
La La Land has its detractors, if you see Damien Chazelle’s film as one that exists solely to portray Gosling’s pianist Seb saving jazz. What La La Land is more about, though, is effort: the effort required to chase your dream and to fall in love, to further that dream and to maintain that love. Is all that effort worth it if you achieve one form of success, but not the other? Chazelle forces us to decide in the film’s devastating final moments. And because Gosling is so adept at conveying the process of trying before then, he makes Seb’s journey look more straightforward than it really is. Think of the exhaustion with which he sings “City of Stars,” a love song to a place he’s realized might never love him back. As he walks on that pier, it’s with a weary forlornness that contrasts well with how gently he duets with Emma Stone; here, maybe, is someone who would make this time fuller, more vivid, more real. The imperceptible smile he gives Stone’s Mia, years after they’ve broken up and she walks into his jazz club with her husband, is a memory of a time shared, lost, and treasured, and it’s a beautiful moment of subtlety and grace. (And it helped him get another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.)
This is the movie that made Gosling a household name, and it’s a romantic drama adapted from a Nicholas Sparks novel. It’s not quite prestigious, of course. But unlike many other Sparks adaptations, in Gosling and Rachel McAdams’s hands, this one glides by. “If you’re a bird, I’m a bird” and “It wasn’t over, it still isn’t over”; the heat and humor with which the pair of them spar and shove ice cream in each other’s faces; that rain kiss, oh my. The Notebook was Gosling introducing himself as not just a hottie, but a considerate, respectful one, a gentleman and a freak, and he’s maintained that duality in his filmography since. He’s played womanizers, but when he falls, he falls hard, and that unwavering adoration is just another facet of Gosling’s ability to play all different kinds of intensity. Plus, Gosling and McAdams gave us the best MTV Movie Awards moment ever by re-creating their iconic cinematic kiss onstage, codifying this movie as a millennial touchstone. For that generation-defining bit of romantic spectacle, we thank them for their service.
Could anyone but Gosling make a near-incel so lovable? As Ken, Barbie’s besotted maybe-boyfriend who can’t ever get a kiss, a sleepover invite, or much attention from Margot Robbie’s titular character, Gosling combines the stewing dissatisfaction of The Believer and The United States of Leland with the elastic-limbed wackiness of The Nice Guys and practically steals the entire movie. Gosling looks like he’s fighting to hold in laughter the whole time, but never does his performance feel farcical or forced. Instead, he captures the contradictory sense of a character who doesn’t understand why he’s feeling what he’s feeling, but sinks into emotion anyway: the drunk-with-infatuation way he gazes at Barbie, the anxious glee in his eyes when he discovers the intoxicating pull of patriarchy, the palpable sadness as he belts out “Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blonde fragility?” during his song-and-dance number “I’m Just Ken.” In a movie that grapples with big questions about purpose, consumerism, and the meaning we give ourselves and what we love, Gosling’s careening performance is a perfect complement to Robbie’s more inquisitive one, and a thoughtful weaponization of all the ways we’ve objectified Gosling’s looks over the years. The man uses his abs as a weapon during a fight in Barbie’s climactic third act, and it’s simultaneously so dumb and so delightful. All hail Ken, our new king of the himbos.
9. The Believer (2001)
Gosling’s most difficult film, the one with the haziest themes about identity, self-loathing, and religious belief, could have been an unwatchable slog with another actor. But he is blazingly charismatic, and completely horrifying, as a young Jewish man who becomes a neo-Nazi, surrounding himself with fanatics and fascists as he grapples with his own capacity for empathy. Why Gosling’s Daniel hates so fully is never really answered, but the film doesn’t exactly need a cause when the actor’s grasp of its effects are so good. Gosling voices the film’s thought-provoking questions about victimization and villainy with full commitment, and his rigidity — that tall posture, those limitless eyes — add another layer to the work. What could have been just a mimicry of, say, Edward Norton in American History X becomes something distinctly pitiable and unnerving on its own terms, and Gosling chased the heights of this tormented-20-something performance for a long time, up until the next film on our list.
8. Half Nelson (2006)
Here’s Gosling’s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination, and it’s deserved. In some ways, 17 years on, Half Nelson shows its age: Gosling stars as Dan, a cocaine-addicted middle-school history teacher in Brooklyn who befriends one of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), whose brother is in prison for dealing drugs. With a setup like that, you can probably predict the ways in which Dan and Drey’s relationship will become complicated, maybe even inappropriate, as the school year progresses. Yet Gosling is riveting as a man in free fall, someone whose apologies for his bad behavior are beginning to wear thin on his co-workers, friends, and family. (I’m taking his “It’s just not cool to be a Nazi anymore, baby,” when a date comments on his controversial book collection and asks if he’d read Mein Kampf, as a nicely unintentional nod to The Believer.) The war between regret and self-destruction plays out most unforgettably in a scene where Drey walks into a motel room for a drug deal and finds Dan inside. The little nod he gives her as he holds his money out, the way he’s slumped against the doorframe, how his head rests on his hand like everything about his body is too heavy to move — Dan is broken and beat, but he doesn’t want to scare Drey with it. Underneath all of his fucked-upness, he’s still cogent enough to know that. The best Gosling movies have a moment where he shatters you, and Half Nelson just doesn’t let up.
Here’s Gosling’s hidden talent as an actor: He’s quirkier and more willing to look foolish than many of his peers, and that flexibility gives him a tenderness in situations that might otherwise be too absurd to be taken seriously. Consider Lars and the Real Girl, in which Gosling plays a socially awkward man who struggles to connect with his brother and sister-in-law, co-workers, and fellow townspeople; he’s noncommittal during small talk and he can’t bear to be touched. Gosling makes Lars twitchy and blinky, touchy and sensitive — until he orders a lifelike, RealDoll-style mannequin online that he introduces to everyone in his life as Bianca. As they all indulge him in this fantasy world where Bianca is his girlfriend, Gosling incrementally lets Lars open up, lets him smile, lets him chat, lets him share the personality that Lars had hidden away for so long. Again, like Half Nelson, there’s something a little expected about this plot, and about how Bianca becomes a conduit for Lars’s growth. The balancing act of oddness and affability that Gosling pulls off, though, might make Lars and the Real Girl the most heartwarming film he’s ever made.
Let’s move from heartwarming to heartbreaking: I have only ever watched Derek Cianfrance’s first movie with Gosling once, and I will never watch it again. It’s too annihilating, too much of an evisceration of the idea of true love; this is marriage as the certain creator of despondency and despair, no matter how hard you try. Spanning five years, the film follows Gosling’s Dean and Michelle Williams’s Cindy, who fall quickly and thoroughly in love and then fall prey to the outside forces so many couples do: the difficulty of maintaining work, the difficulty of raising a child, the difficulty of finding time for themselves amid the chaos of day-to-day life. It hurts because it’s so relatable, and because Gosling and Williams are so in tune; the depth they each bring adds legitimacy and poignancy to their ever-increasing fights. Cianfrance prefers close-ups, holding long on Gosling when he’s swearing his love at the beginning of their relationship (all impassioned promises, light flirtation, and eye contact) and tries to understand what he’s doing wrong at the end (his face morphing through befuddlement and indignation); he’s right and he’s wrong at the same time, and that’s Blue Valentine’s clearest calamity. Sometimes things just don’t work out and it never makes sense why, and Gosling embodies that mystery with breathtaking care.
It makes sense that Gosling’s collaborations with Cianfrance should be back-to-back on this list because they are, like so much else of Gosling’s work, a themed pair. Dean in Blue Valentine and Luke in The Place Beyond the Pines are two of a kind, individualistic dreamers who step willingly into responsibility and love fully when allowed to, but can’t quite figure out the right way to provide. A motorcycle stuntman who learns that he has a son with former lover Romina (Eva Mendes), Gosling’s Luke is simultaneously tough and brooding (that bleached hair, all those tattoos, his ease on a bike) and nakedly craving something more. Gosling’s most emblematic line as Luke — “I’m still his father, I can give him stuff” — is all that ache bundled into an admission he looks almost surprised to make, and those little glimpses of wonder, when Luke looks thrown by his own confessions of loneliness, permeate this performance. Gosling’s only in the movie for a third of it, but he looms phenomenally large; it’s a sign of his potency as an actor that the entire rest of The Place Beyond the Pines arcs around the bone-deep impact of his character’s tragic end.
There are people who will tell you that Blade Runner 2049 should never have been made because the first film was so strong in its ambiguous ending, that it’s misogynistic, that replacing Sean Young with a CGI re-creation was disrespectful, that it’s all style over substance. We had this very discussion here at Vulture, and some points were made! But at the very least, in the unenviable ask of replacing Harrison Ford, Gosling is an equipped answer. His performance as replicant Officer K never feels like a re-creation of Ford’s as blade-runner-and-maybe-replicant Deckard in 1982’s Blade Runner, but an evolution of it, one that’s infused with the qualities Gosling does so well: a sense of something simmering underneath the surface, a fist-clenched level of control, and a longing to be perceived. The film hands Gosling an array of revelations and experiments, including the turmoil of his failed baseline test (“Do you feel that there’s a part of you that’s missing?”) and the delicacy of his half-virtual sex scene with Mackenzie Davis and Ana de Armas, and the little cracks of interiority he brings to them reflect the film’s musings about what makes us human, or more human than human. It’s a performance of increments, and it’s the second-finest display of how Gosling can uniquely swing between placidity and fury.
The best expression of that extreme oscillation is in Drive, his first collaboration with Refn that birthed cool-guy Gosling. The trick of this film is how it mutates the ferment and turbulence of Gosling’s previous work in films like The United States of Leland, Stay, and Murder by Numbers. His car, his hammer, his scorpion bomber jacket: All are accessories to the yawning hollowness Gosling’s Driver has clearly spent years protecting inside himself. When the characters played by Carey Mulligan and Kaden Leos begin to tiptoe into that void, Gosling sells the Driver’s transition into a man finally come alive, revitalized by love and purified by violence. A real human being and a real hero, indeed. (And it’s still the coolest he’s looked onscreen. Those leather driving gloves, yowza.)
The erasure of the R-rated comedy has been a distinct loss for movies, and The Nice Guys remains one of the best recent examples of what we’re missing out on. Gosling and Russell Crowe are perfectly at home in Shane Black’s ’70s-set neo-noir as a PI and enforcer who start trying to find a missing adult-film actress and get sucked into a larger conspiracy related to the auto industry and the environmental-protection movement; the actors chomp through Black and co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi’s pithy and dense dialogue like they can’t get enough of it. They’re agreeably matched foils, with Gosling settling into a high-pitched dandy mode that is gleefully oppositional to Crowe’s grizzled aura. Who knew Gosling was such an entertaining screamer and such a devoted physical comedian? This role is so different from all his other work that it ricochets up in esteem, proving how far Gosling can push himself when given the chance. The Nice Guys moves to the rhythm of one ludicrous Gosling moment after another — the peevishness with which he defends jumping into a pool of half-naked women because “I had to question the mermaids”; the flailing about in a bathroom stall as he smokes and brandishes a gun on the toilet — and it’s a failure of our industry that it took seven years to get this man back in the comedic vein with Barbie.
First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic that is Chazelle’s second collaboration with Gosling, feels like watching Gosling act his way out of a straitjacket. The character is so constrained that every scene is charged with the energy Gosling is using to stay wound, to stay tight; it’s only through the most minuscule adjustments that we understand the cataclysmic forces fighting inside Gosling’s mind. Armstrong’s courting death every day at NASA in the name of discovery and avoiding death every day in a home consumed by grief for his passed-away daughter. It’s enough to tear a man apart, and Gosling conveys that encroaching disintegration with every silent gaze and every set of his jaw. The performance is so powerful not just because of Gosling’s self-composure, but because of how he points that severity at others — the appealing looks he gives wife Janet, played by Claire Foy, who wants more communication from the man she loves; his evident agony, but increased resolution, when he learns of yet another colleague and friend’s death as the pilots train to make it to the moon.
What can an actor convey with their body alone? Not their voice and not their face, but just their stance and the character they’ve built up until that point? First Man’s moon-set climax, when the spacesuit-clad Gosling drops Armstrong’s daughter’s bracelet into the Little West crater as a way to let go of his grief, is so cathartic because we know the weight of that choice and the tiny glimmer of resolution it provides, thanks to Gosling’s preceding thoroughness. Justin Hurwitz’s theremin-and-synth score is integral, but the scene — and the movie overall — wouldn’t be a fraction of what it is without Gosling’s extraordinary emotiveness. It’s first-rate.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmVzdC1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctbW92aWVzLXJhbmtlZC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

The notion of the punk-rock superhero fits Swift's own flair, and even Ryan Reynolds' declared his wish to have her on set in 2022, which basically fanned these rumors. According to several sources, Taylor Swift may appear in the film in a cameo role. Meanwhile, Fans are impatiently awaiting clarification on whether Taylor Swift will play Dazzler in Deadpool 3.

What do we know about Taylor Swift's cameo in Deadpool 3?
Taylor Swift's possible appearance in Deadpool began in 2022, following Ryan Reynolds' acknowledgement of the possibility in an interview with ET. On August 12, 2023, Disinsider confirmed these rumors by placing Taylor Swift on their list of unconfirmed characters set to appear in the upcoming Deadpool 3.
Despite the lack of an official statement from Marvel regarding the cast, it looks like Taylor Swift will make her cinematic debut soon. Swift joining forces with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is an enticing addition to the sequel. Swift's involvement with Deadpool 3 has further sparked rumors about who will or will not be a part of this exceptional ensemble.
When did speculation of Taylor Swift being a part of Deadpool 3 begin?
Although no formal confirmation of Taylor Swift's presence in Deadpool 3 has been made, rumors of her involvement stretch back to 2022. Reynolds, who previously portrayed Deadpool (Wade Wilson), revealed his excitement at Swift's MCU debut in an interview. He told Entertainment Tonight, ""Are you kidding me? I would go to any lengths for that woman. She's an absolute genius.""
The first signs of a Taylor Swift-Ryan Reynolds collaboration were in a teaser video published by Reynolds himself in September 2022.
Fans who were paying attention noted the film's resemblance to Taylor Swift's All Too Well: The Short Film video. Given Reynolds' image as a Swift fan, the teaser video came as no surprise to the singer’s ardent fans.
Taylor Swift was among the names expected to join the cast of Deadpool 3, according to Disinsider. While Dazzler's punk rock aesthetic has historically matched Swift's look, the character has also been played by Halston Sage (Dark Phoenix) and Alexandra Stoddart. However, the MC's broad multiverse narrative allows for a variety of interpretations of the character, making Swilt an ideal match. Her large fan base has turned to social media to express their delight, and the prospect of Dazzler personified by Swift is already generating excitement.

Alongside an array of red love heart emojis, one person penned: ""If this doesn’t mean Ryan Reynolds is on the next Celebrity Bake Off, I don’t want it.""
Another wrote: ""He's only gone and done Bake Off hasn’t he, cemented national treasure status.""
Meanwhile, a third shared: ""This is the crossover I never even knew I needed.""
It wouldn't necessarily come as a shock if Reynolds or Lively were to appear in GBBO, especially given as the pair are big fans of the show themselves.
Reynolds previously told People in 2019: ""We live in a world that’s pretty divisive right now and there’s a lot going on. And I like that show just because it’s a nice thing to watch at night.
""Everybody on the show is nice to each other, which I find refreshing. It’s not really about anything that’s going to remind you of chaos.""

2023-08-16 07:49:37+05:30,Barbie: How much will Margot Robbie earn from fantasy comedy film post USD 1 billion box-office collection?,"Barbie released about a month back and has been raking in some serious box office collections worldwide, here's how much Margot Robbie will earn from the film.","Fantasy-comedy film Barbie has been a worldwide craze: right from its marketing, hype pre-release, box-office collections, the Barbiecore trend resurgence, and the discourse about the film post-release. The movie, which has raked in more than $1 billion worldwide, is now a cultural phenomenon as it goes down as one of the biggest successes in film history.
The Greta Gerwig directorial stars actors Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken. With its massive success, here's what Robbie, who is also a producer on the film apart from starring in it, will rake in when it comes to her salary and the additional profits.

How much will Margot Robbie earn from Barbie post $1 billion success?
According to Variety, Robbie will make around $50 million in salary and box office bonuses, as revealed by three insiders who know about her signed deal. With Barbie having raked in a whopping $526.3 million at the domestic box office and $657.6 million at the worldwide box office, the total collection adds up to $1.18 billion globally. Meanwhile, the film has no signs of slowing down since its release on July 21, 2023, with thriller film Oppenheimer.
While the Christopher Nolan directorial, which also released on the same date, also earned some good box-office collections, it failed to compete with Barbie's almost double earnings. Meanwhile, Greta Gerwig, Barbie's director and co-writer, will also be receiving bonuses. Barbie has already become the highest-grossing film by a female director and is the second highest-grossing release in the history of popular film studio Warner Brothers.
Margot Robbie pitching Barbie as billion-dollar project
Robbie produced Barbie with her production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, which she founded back in 2014 with her husband, Tom Ackerley. As per an interesting fact, in an early meeting, the actress pitched Barbie to Mattel and Warner Brothers as a billion-dollar project. She added that she knew she was probably overselling but she wanted the film to happen.
Seems like her instincts were spot on considering the film is enjoying its stay in the billion-dollar club and has cemented itself in cinematic history. The 33-year-old Australian actress has previously starred as the iconic Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad and has been nominated for Academy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards for her performances through the years. She is set to star in a prequel to the Ocean's films, opposite Barbie co-star Ryan Gosling.

,Here's the First Look at Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman Suited Up for 'Deadpool 3','Deadpool 3' is set for release in May 2024.,"The boys are back!
On Monday, Fandango released the first look of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as Deadpool and Wolverine for Deadpool 3.
""Our first look at @VancityReynolds and Hugh Jackman suited up as Deadpool and Wolverine in #Deadpool3,"" the caption alongside the picture read.
While it doesn't give away much, it does confirm that the Marvel anti-hero and X-Men character will share screen time together in the upcoming film, set to be released in May 2024.
Reynolds took to his Instagram to share the same image with a cheeky quote.
""Don't blink,"" he captioned the photo in addition to posting two little Deadpool and Wolverine gifs.
Jackman shared the same picture and message on his respective Instagram Story.

Neither stars of the franchise offered any more information about the highly anticipated film -- and the return of Wolverine to the big screen.
This is the first time Reynolds or Jackman have shared any other hints about the film since announcing that the X-Men character would be appearing in the movie.
In September 2022, Reynolds and Jackman appeared in a social video, where they said they would answer some fan questions about the film. Of course, it wasn't very helpful.
""Quick explainer video that tackles… 1) Timeline questions 2) Logan canon 3) MCU FAQ 4) Whether we can do this all day or not.""
However, they didn't actually settle much beyond the timing of the character's death, which was shown in the final 2017 installment of the Wolverine trilogy. ""Logan takes place in 2029. Totally separate thing. Logan died in Logan,"" Reynolds said. ""Not touching that.""
""What actually happens in our film,"" the Deadpool star continued -- except that music drowned out what he and Jackman went on to say, keeping fans just as clueless to the plot as before.
Deadpool's entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was confirmed in January 2021. In an interview with Collider, Marvel Studio President Kevin Feige confirmed a third Reynolds-led Deadpool flick, something that had been uncertain following 20th Century Fox's sale to Disney. In addition to confirming the movie, Feige noted that it will maintain its R-rating, though other MCU films are rated PG-13.

The wacky cartoon, which ran for three seasons in the '90s, focused on a trio of anthropomorphic mice – Throttle, Vinnie and Modo – as they escaped a war on Mars before defending Earth from the evil that destroyed their homeland.
Created by Rick Ungar, the series attracted some big-name voice acting talent, such as Mark Hamill, Rob Paulsen, Dorian Harewood, Michael Dorn, Kath Soucie, Jim Cummings, Neil Ross, Jeff Bennett, Russi Taylor, CCH Pounder and Malcolm McDowell. It also featured Beverly Hills, 90210 stars Tori Spelling, Jason Priestley, Luke Perry and Brian Austin Green.

The show was first revived in 2006, and now it's coming back for more with Reynolds set to co-producer alongside Nacelle.
In a statement (via Deadline), Reynolds said: ""Some people know that I am a motorcycle enthusiast, so it was only natural for us to jump on board Biker Mice from Mars.
""Maximum Effort and Fubo look forward to putting a new spin on this cult classic with our friends at Nacelle.""
Maximum Effort is Reynolds' production company, while Fubo is a streaming service that mostly focuses on sports, but just launched a channel dedicated to Maximum Effort.
Reynolds announced back in June that the channel would carry six hours of Welsh language content every week thanks to a partnership deal with long-running Welsh channel S4C.

2023-07-26 22:31:43+00:00,Mattel Confirms Plot for Cinematic Universe With 'Barbie' Success - Inside the Magic,The success of 'Barbie' has prompted Mattel to officially confirm the scope of how many projects will exist in their new cinematic universe.,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) changed the Film Industry for better or for worse. While they were not the first franchise succeed with serialized feature films, they pioneered it once the character, Nick Fury, uttered his famous words to Tony Stark, “I am here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.” Since then, film studios have attempted to repeat Marvel’s success with their own cinematic universes. Yet, for every Fast Saga and Jurassic Park, there have been franchises with dwindling staying power, like the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and Transformers. Mattel will try to prevail where Hasbro has struggled with the release of several projects in development after the financial triumph of Barbie.
Mattel hired a new CEO, Ynon Kreiz, to revamp the toy company who had declining sales that reached a climax in 2018. Kreiz wanted to transform the company’s iconic toys into a series of movie franchises. This pursuit has now come to fruition with the massive success of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie. The film has grossed $337 million in five days and sales continue to grow. While there is no Barbie sequel in the works, but the Mattel CEO has officially confirmed 14 additional properties that are currently in development.
Here is a list of the Mattel properties being developed into major motion pictures:
Barney
The live-action adaptation of the legendary bear-hugging, purple dinosaur has been pitched as a “surrealistic” A24-like think-piece. Mattel producer, Robbie Brenner, has expressed that it will be Being John Malkovich meets Barney the series. The movie will plan to be about identity, the purpose of life and societal alienation. Brenner divulged that the movie will have adult themes to make it a unique experience for all viewers. It will also star and be produced by Get Out star, Daniel Kaluuya.
Polly Pocket
The story is being written and directed by Girls actress, Lena Dunham. There have been no details about the premise, but actress, Lily Collins, has recently been cast as the lead. Dunham and Collins have professed that they are excited to collaborate with such a “great script.”
Hot Wheels
The top-selling Mattell toy in the world will be adapted and produced by JJ Abrams. The Star Wars director stated that the film will be “grounded and gritty.” Brenner elaborated on Abrams’ comments by explaining that the characters will be relatable, three-dimensional figures with emotional journeys. The movie cannot only be fun, but will need real emotion and stakes.
Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots
This adaptation of the game involving violent robotic fighters will star the accurately casted, Vin Diesel. Brenner claims that the script is in development and that its progress is very exciting.
American Girl
This is not a SNL parody any longer as this adaptation will be a family comedy based on the large roster of well-dressed girl dolls. Producer, Brenner, stated that the story will focus on getting the girls to grow with confidence and develop their character.
Masters of the Universe
Mattel is in search of a new studio to develop this project after Netflix dropped it. The story will center around the buff, bowl-cut sporting hero, He-Man, as he will team up with allies to fight his nemesis, Skeletor.
Other Mattel intellectual properties that are in development will be:
Tom Hank’s Major Matt Mason
Magic 8-Ball
Uno the Movie
Wishbone, based off the adventure-seeking Jack Russell terrier
Matchbox Cars
Thomas the Tank Engine
View Master
Christmas Balloon
There has been no official confirmation that all of these films will exist in the same universe, but many have speculated that this is a calculated move while they wait to see how the other Mattel adaptations due in theaters. It definitely will not be easy to replicate the lightning-in-a-bottle effect created by Barbie.
What do you think of the upcoming cinematic universe? Will it succeed or will it be too late for audiences to accept?",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDcvbWF0dGVsLXBsb3RzLWZvci1jaW5lbWF0aWMtdW5pdmVyc2Utd2l0aC1iYXJiaWUtc3VjY2Vzcy1qdGMxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

On Monday, the Lemme founder shared an up-close look at what she wore when taking her daughter and friends to see the Barbie movie on her Instagram Story — and aside from being as pink as possible, the look also featured sky-high leather booties.

In the snap, the A-lister stopped for a mirror selfie in her massive walk-in closet before heading to the film’s showing in a very on-theme bubblegum-pink leather jacket (worn buttoned only at the top) paired with matching knee-length cargo shorts and a bump-hugging black bodysuit. Kardashian wore the baggy shorts unbuttoned and folded over at the waist to accommodate her growing baby bump (she and husband Travis Barker announced they were expecting their first child together back in June), and she added a pair of black leather pointy-toe booties and rectangular-shaped sunglasses to accessorize the ensemble.
In the glam department, Kourtney kept her makeup to a minimum and finished the look by tying her brunette bob up into a laid-back bun with a middle part.
“Took the girls to see Barbie, had very strict instructions to wear my pink jorts,” Kardashian wrote on the Instagram Stories slide.

This isn’t the first time that Kourt has rocked a Barbie-approved look in recent weeks: Back on July 12, she slipped into her Barbiecore best yet again when soaking up the sun in Hawaii. In the Instagram post, the Poosh founder posed in a bump-baring one-piece swimsuit that featured the largest midriff cutout, maybe ever. She paired the barely-there suit with a matching cut-out maxiskirt (complete with a leg slit, because of course) and a gigantic circular straw hat for good measure.

The Wolverine actor, 54, accompanied fellow movie star Reynolds, 46, as his football team slumped to a 3-5 home defeat against MK Dons at The Racecourse Ground in Wales after being promoted to League Two back in April.
Jackman stepped out for the sporting event dressed in a dark zip-up jumper over a T-shirt, and wore a Wrexham A.F.C. baseball cap to show his support for the team. Reynolds looked stylish in a salmon pink shirt worn over a white tee, which he teamed with beige trousers and a padded Wrexham A.F.C. jacket.
The actors, who co-star in the upcoming Deadpool 3, are currently striking amid the SAG/AFTRA labour dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
Reynolds and Jackman are famously involved in a fake feud which is believed to have its origins from them co-starring in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

Good times: The Wolverine actor accompanied fellow movie star Ryan Reynolds to watch his football team play a home game at The Racecourse Ground in Wales, where MK Dons beat them 3-5
Guided tour: Reynolds, who co-owns the football team, pointed out some of the action to Jackman
Earlier this year, Jackman appealed to the Oscars organisers not to 'validate' Reynolds with an award, while on the opening night of Jackman's new broadway show The Music Man, Reynolds gave the actor a picture of himself with a note saying: 'Good luck with your little show.'
Saturday's encounter was an emotional occasion in north Wales as a sell-out crowd watched their side play their first Sky Bet League Two game since 2008.
But Wrexham returned with a bump in front of ambitious owners Reynolds and McElhenney, with the dominant Dons becoming the first side to win a regular season match at the SToK Racecourse since November 2021.
Ahead of Wrexham's first game of the season on Saturday, Reynolds and co-owner Rob McElhenney were asked by Sky Sports News about the recent announcement that Tom Brady had purchased a share in Birmingham City.
'I know Tom a little bit and I don't think you need to know him to know he has the spirit of a lion and a competitor in every way, shape and form,' Reynolds said.
'Whatever he has cooked up for Birmingham, he is going to bring it. Come on in, the water is warm!'
McElhenney was then asked if he had any advice for seven-time Super Bowl winner Brady and he had his own amusing reply.
'I would never give Tom Brady words of wisdom over professional sports. But Tom, if you have any advice for us, you could send it our way!'
It comes after a source close to Brady exclusively told DailyMail.Com: 'He has seen what Ryan Reynolds did with Wrexham and is doing with Wrexham and he wants a piece of that for himself,' the source close to Brady said.
'He is going to fully support [Birmingham] in his time as part owner, he is all in and will do anything to see it work out.'
'Tom was going to invest in a soccer club and be a part of ownership at some point, and Birmingham City was at the right place at the right time for Tom to add to his portfolio of business acquisitions now that he is retired and has a lot more time on his hands to focus on all of that.'
The 46-year-old will chair the advisory board and assist the club by bringing his knowledge and expertise regarding human performance to St. Andrew's.

Under the ownership of Reynolds and McElhenney, Wrexham have soared and today end their 15-year exile from England's top four tiers. The duo are eyeing a promotion from League Two in their first season.
They have also helped Wrexham claim global spotlight through a Netflix series as well as their regular promotion of the team across the United States and beyond.
Unlike the rest of their League Two rivals, Wrexham's growing fame in the United States allowed Phil Parkinson's side to go on a pre-season tour of North America which included games against Chelsea and Manchester United.
Not content with reaching League Two, Wrexham's ambitious celebrity owners have set their sights on further promotions towards the Premier League.
But MK Dons' victory served as something of a reality check for Wrexham after their fairytale run over the last year.
The sides were two divisions apart just three months ago, with Wrexham earning promotion from the National Conference and MK Dons relegated from League One.
Ben Foster could not prevent Eoghan O'Connell's own goal or Mohamed Eisa's excellent solo effort, with Wrexham's Jacob Mendy reducing the deficit just before half-time.
Jonathan Leko drilled home from distance and then beat Foster again as MK Dons took control.
The hosts netted again through Jordan Davies but Daniel Harvie got the visitors' fifth before Wrexham's Anthony Forde completed the scoring in stoppage-time.
During the match, McElhenney was seen sitting in the autism-friendly zone handing out Maltesers to children in the crowd.
On July 14, Deadpool 3 became the first major film to halt production after the SAG/AFTRA strike took effect.

Skills: The actor showed off his superhero moves
The Marvel movie, directed by Shawn Levy, was seen being filmed in Norfolk, England, with Ryan Reynolds in the title role and Hugh Jackman reprising his X-Men character Wolverine just two days prior.
Jennifer Garner is also supposed to be making an appearance while reviving her Elektra role from Daredevil. Also in the cast is Morena Baccarin as Vanessa.
Deadpool 3 had a release date of May 3, 2024, but it looks as if that will now change as it has taken an indefinite pause due to the strike.
The Screen Actors Guild voted for a work stoppage after their demands for higher wages and protections against artificial intelligence were not met.
Under the rules of a strike, SAG-AFTRA members are not able to film any movie or TV series, or take part in any press or film premieres.
SAG-AFTRA was demanding higher pay to counteract inflation, and guarantees for their future livelihoods.
In addition to salaries when they are actively working, actors earn payments called 'residuals' every time a film or show they starred in is aired on network or cable - which is particularly helpful when performers are between projects.
But streamers like Netflix and Disney+ do not disclose viewing figures for their shows, and offer the same flat rate for everything on their platforms, regardless of its popularity.
In addition, the union was seeking 'a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors' digital likenesses' and actors are worried that their digital images could be used without their permission or proper compensation.
Stopping filming on Deadpool 3 - which has a massive budget of well over $100m - is a big deal in Hollywood as a lot rides on the movie.
However, shooting began in May and there is plenty of material already in the can but the director likely needs more camera time to complete the project.
The film will be the first series entry released by the Walt Disney Company, after the studio's acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjM3NjI0OS9IdWdoLUphY2ttYW4tUnlhbi1SZXlub2xkcy1XcmV4aGFtLUVGTC1EZWFkcG9vbC0zLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTIzNzYyNDkvYW1wL0h1Z2gtSmFja21hbi1SeWFuLVJleW5vbGRzLVdyZXhoYW0tRUZMLURlYWRwb29sLTMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

After an opening weekend of $162 million, Barbie scored the highest domestic gross on a Monday in Warner Bros. history with $26 million. With the box office success and critical acclaim, Barbie 2 discussions have already hit the Internet, but Greta Gerwig is not ready to talk about a sequel just yet.
In an interview with The New York Times, Gerwig was asked if Barbie would be the start of a franchise. For now, Gerwig believes this is the end of her time with the iconic character.
“At this moment, it’s all I’ve got,” Gerwig said about the potential for a Barbie sequel. “I feel like that at the end of every movie, like I’ll never have another idea, and everything I’ve ever wanted to do, I did. I wouldn’t want to squash anybody else’s dream but for me, at this moment, I’m at totally zero.”
Who is Involved in Barbie?
Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, while Ryan Gosling plays Ken. Together, they travel to the real world after an existential crisis causes them to question their lives in Barbieland.
Besides Robbie, several actresses play various iterations of Barbie, including Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, Dua Lipa, Nicola Coughlan, and Marisa Abela. Like Barbie, different actors, such as Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scuti Gatwa, John Cena, and Scott Evans, play other versions of Ken.
The ensemble cast also features America Ferrera, Ariana Greenblatt, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman, Connor Swindells, Emerald Fennell, and Will Ferrell.

,Emma Corrin needed Marvel 'debrief' after being cast in 'Deadpool 3',"Emma Corrin, who'd only seen 'Spider-Man' and 'Black Panther' prior to joining 'Deadpool 3,' says they were in dire need of an MCU crash course.","Emma Corrin is a Marvel newbie in more ways than one.
The Crown star, who is set to join ""the Deadpool family"" as a villain in Deadpool 3, revealed during the press tour for their upcoming FX limited series A Murder at the End of the World that they knew very little about the saga prior to landing the role.
""Hands up, I'm not a Marvel person,"" Corrin, who uses they/them pronouns, told Empire Magazine in an interview conducted prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. ""I've watched Spider-Man and Black Panther. I was like, 'Look, you're gonna have to debrief me into this.'""
When the Merc with the Mouth next appears on screen, he will officially make his entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe — an ever-expanding multiverse that currently includes 32 movies and at least nine individual series (more if you count those that predate Disney+). Understandably, Corrin didn't quite have the time to cram them all in before arriving on set.
""It's such an intricate world,"" they explained. ""There's so much to it, it's an absolute mind f---. All the language and the Easter eggs, and this person is related to that person who did this, and this person came back and this person's dead… it's amazing.""

Though Corrin wasn't deep in the fandom prior to landing the Deadpool 3 role, they quickly understood the staying power of the million dollar franchise.
""I really understand why it means as much as it does to so many people,"" they said. ""It's a phenomenon, and I feel really lucky to be part of it. Especially Deadpool, because I love the fact that it's self-aware, and critical of its own inner-workings.""
Very little has been revealed about the Deadpool sequel, which paused production days after unveiling a first look at Hugh Jackman donning his classic yellow Wolverine suit with Ryan Reynolds' Wade Wilson at his side. Corrin's character remains under wraps, but they have since confirmed their role as an antagonist.
""I feel really excited to play a villain,"" Corrin said. ""I haven't done that, and it's an itch I want to scratch.""
Deadpool 3 director Shawn Levy reached out to Corrin for the part after seeing their performance in a stage production of Virginia Woolf's Orlando, but, in typical Marvel fashion, offered very few details about the movie.
""I'd heard about the project but, classic Marvel, they couldn't tell me anything about it,"" Corrin recalled. ""Absolutely nothing. Zilch. So I met him being like, 'I don't know what this is about.'""
Corrin first turned heads as a young Princess Diana on Netflix's The Crown, and has continued their period piece success with My Policeman — starring opposite Harry Styles — and an adaptation of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Along with Deadpool 3, Corrin will next be seen in Robert Eggers' Nosferatu.

U.S. has issued a statement following criticism from Japan after controversial messaging surrounding Barbie and Oppenheimer.,"Warner Bros has responded to criticism from its studio branch in Japan over memes surrounding Barbie and Oppenheimer.
In July, two drastically different movies—Barbie, a fantasy comedy, and Oppenheimer, a historical thriller—were released on the same day. Audiences were tickled by the event, calling it “Barbenheimer” and vowing to watch both films on the same day. Both films have performed successfully at the box office.
Japan’s Barbie Twitter account responded to how the U.S. Barbie account supported memes of a mash-up between the films, which featured images like Barbie smiling next to the nuclear explosion from the Oppenheimer promotional material. “We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans. … We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan,” reads their tweet.

Recently, two vastly different movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer, were released on the same day. Murphy starred as the titular character in Oppenheimer, where he played the father of the atomic bomb in a dark historical thriller. Meanwhile, Barbie has been a huge hit at the box office, with fans praising the comedy and themes.
In a recent interview, Murphy said he would be open to crossing over to the other side and playing Ken in a potential Barbie sequel. “Sure, yeah. Let’s read the script, let’s have a conversation,” Murphy responded about playing Ken. “I can’t wait to see [Barbie]. I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it’s great for cinema to get all these great movies happening this summer.”
Barbie features many actors playing Ken, including Ryan Gosling, Simu Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir. It would be entirely possible for Cillian Murphy to join the ensemble cast of a Barbie movie. It would also be against type for Murphy, who has primarily appeared in dramas and is not known for his quirky comedic roles.

There have been two different movie pitches shared with the public so far. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
A movie based on the popular family board game has been in the works for over a decade.
A Monopoly movie was first mooted by Oscar-nominated director Ridley Scott during an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 2007. The director said he thought the game would produce ""a hysterically amusing and I think rather exciting film.""
In 2009, producer Frank Beddor came up with an interesting pitch for a Monopoly movie, which he told IGN that Scott was excited about.
Beddor described the idea as a ""comedic action-adventure"" about a ""lovable loser"" who has to battle ""the evil Parker Brothers"" in a game of real-life Monopoly.
The film never made it to the big screen and instead, another film was developed through a partnership between Lionsgate and Hasbro in 2015, with ""The Truman Show"" writer Andrew Niccol attached. The movie ended up not happening.
In 2019, Deadline reported that Kevin Hart will star in a Monopoly movie directed by ""The Blackening"" director Tim Story, though no plot details or filming dates have been revealed since then.
However, with Lionsgate's recent acquisition of Entertainment One's TV and film operations from Hasbro this year, it seems a Monopoly movie is a top priority.
""We look forward to partnering with them, especially on a movie adaptation of Monopoly,"" Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said of the sale to Lionsgate in August.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy1pbnNwaXJlZC10b3lzLWdhbWVzLWJhcmJpZS1tb25vcG9seS1wbGF5LWRvaC0yMDIzLTjSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMtaW5zcGlyZWQtdG95cy1nYW1lcy1iYXJiaWUtbW9ub3BvbHktcGxheS1kb2gtMjAyMy04P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Barbie’s Dreamland Is a Pop Culture Paradise
Without a doubt, the Greta Gerwig-helmed live-action Barbie is one of 2023’s best outings thus far — and one that will most likely stand the test of time. Starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has made an impressive mark for its feminist and comedic take on Mattel’s popular toy brand. But apart from the film’s direction and its multiple pop culture references, its original music and score undeniably contributed to the comedy-drama feature’s landslide victory.
The tracklist for Barbie: Score From the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack includes Billie Eilish’s “Bus Stop Billie,” “Meeting Ruth,” and the epilogue version of the singer’s “What Was I Made For?”
In a press release, Ronson said that the film’s overflowing emotion hugely inspired them during the composition process.
“The late nights and crazy hours we put into Barbie were all worth it to us, because we were so in love with this film. And we truly hope listening to our score from beginning to end will give others the same emotional, whimsical experience they had watching this magical film,” he added.
Apart from Robbie portraying the original, stereotypical Barbie, a plethora of Barbies and Kens also appeared in the movie, including Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie, Issa Rae’s President Barbie, Alexandra Shipp’s Writer Barbie, Ritu Arya’s Journalist Barbie, and Emma Mackey’s Physicist Barbie, to mention a few.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L211c2ljL25ld3MvMTMxNTE5MS1iYXJiaWUtb3JpZ2luYWwtc291bmR0cmFjay1nZXRzLW11bHRpLWNvbG9yZWQtdmlueWwtcmVsZWFzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Here’s where you can stream all the films that inspired Greta Gerwig’s Barbie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.,"If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement .
Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is finally upon us, and audiences love it. The comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the eponymous doll and her maybe-boyfriend Ken has made big money at the box office, with audiences and critics both effusively praising the film’s extravagant production design and pitch-perfect soundtrack alongside Robbie’s and Gosling’s sensational performances.
Greatness never occurs in a vacuum, and that goes especially for Gerwig’s film. Speaking to Letterboxd prior to the film’s premiere, the director cited over 30 movies that inspired her while working on the film, from musicals and fast-talking comedies starring Gene Kelly and Cary Grant to films directed by such cinematic icons as Federico Fellini, Stanley Kubrick, Jacques Demy, and Pedro Almodóvar.
If you’re aching for more Barbie-like entertainment, we’ve pulled together a list of where you can stream or rent nearly all of the films Gerwig has cited as inspiration. Classics like A Matter of Life and Death, All That Jazz, and Oklahoma! are sadly unavailable online, but trust us — there’s plenty here to keep you occupied.
Gold Diggers of 1935
Year: 1935
Run time: 1h 35m
Director: Busby Berkeley
Cast: Dick Powell, Adolphe Menjou, Gloria Stuart
Gerwig mentioned Gold Diggers of 1935 in the same breath as Fred Zinnemann’s 1955 adaptation of the musical Oklahoma! as a film that most inspired her approach to filming dance sequences in Barbie. Gold Diggers of 1935 centers on the romantic antics of a group of guests at a luxurious resort hotel, among them an eccentric millionaire, a wealthy heiress, and a stage director. “[The film] has this one really surreal dance number with a bunch of steps, Gerwig told Letterboxd. “There’s, like, a million tap dancers that go through each other. It’s kind of unreal.”
Gold Diggers of 1935 is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.
2001: A Space Odyssey
Year: 1968
Run time: 2h 29m
Director: Stanley Kubrick
Cast: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain
Stanley Kubrick’s sci-fi opus has exerted a nigh monolithic (pun intended) influence over the medium of film and cinematic storytelling since it first landed in theaters in 1968. Among the film’s most iconic moments are that of its first scene, wherein a tribe of hominins first encounter the alien artifact that seemingly grants them the power of intelligence. The influence on Barbie is obvious to anyone who has seen the first trailer for the film, wherein a group of young girls standing in a valley similar to the one seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey first encounters the doll that would change the history of children’s toys forever.
2001: A Space Odyssey is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.
An American in Paris
Year: 1951
Run time: 1h 54m
Director: Vincente Minnelli

Cast: Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant

Gerwig is a big fan of Gene Kelly. As she told Letterboxd, “When I was growing up, Gene Kelly was my crush, which was weird.” Not weird at all, Greta; after all, he’s a canonical Hollywood dreamboat!

Gerwig singled out the opening scene, in which Jerry wakes up in his tiny apartment and gets ready for the day, as a inspiration. “There was something so satisfying about watching him go through his morning routine — that was one of the morning routines I loved. Even though Barbie has much more of an expanse, I was like, ‘This is a great opening,’” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “Then they have Leslie Caron in these very graphic, beautiful shots against an entirely purple room or an entirely green room; she’s going through her day. It was these flourishes that were almost surreal in that film.”

An American in Paris is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

And the Ship Sails On

Year: 1983

Run time: 2h 8m

Director: Federico Fellini

Cast: Freddie Jones, Barbara Jefford, Victor Poletti

Federico Fellini is not quite the first name you’d think of as a possible inspiration for Barbie. The Italian filmmaker (and avid comic book fan) is one of the most influential directors of the 20th century, known for such eccentric and captivating masterpieces as La Strada, La Dolce Vita, and his 1963 magnum opus 8½. Gerwig cites Fellini’s 1983 comedy-drama And the Ship Sails On as an inspiration for her approach to crafting the more surreal, practical effects of Barbie — in particular the fake sea effect as seen in Fellini’s film.

And the Ship Sails On is available to stream on Criterion Channel.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind

Year: 1977

Run time: 2h 18m

Director: Steven Spielberg

Cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon

Gerwig cites Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi drama as one of her favorite movies and a key inspiration for Barbie. Speaking to Letterboxd, she explained that the film is “about this maniacal belief in something that seemed sort of crazy, but was actually true.”

Close Encounters of the Third Kind is available to stream on Tubi and Pluto TV, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Grease

Year: 1978

Run time: 1h 50m

Director: Randal Kleiser

Cast: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing

Barbie owes a visible debt to the anachronistic flair of Grease, Randal Kleiser’s classic romantic musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. “Grease is great,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It’s a musical about the 1950s, but made in the 1970s and everybody’s 30. Love it.”

Grease is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Heaven Can Wait

Year: 1978

Run time: 1h 41m

Director: Warren Beatty, Buck Henry

Cast: Warren Beatty, James Mason, Julie Christie

In between the fantastical music numbers and wacky set-pieces, Gerwig’s Barbie is punctuated by genuine moments of existential questioning and despair. Heaven Can Wait, the 1978 drama directed by and starring Warren Beatty, was one of the films Gerwig looked to for inspiration in that regard. “One thing I love about Heaven Can Wait is it’s extremely high concept, but it’s always human,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “There’s nothing about it that makes you feel distanced from it. It totally works, even though in some ways it seems sort of wacky, but when you’re watching, it’s so beautiful.”

Heaven Can Wait is available to stream on Pluto TV, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

His Girl Friday

Year: 1940

Run time: 1h 32m

Director: Howard Hawks

Cast: Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Bellamy

The classic 1940 screwball comedy stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as a formerly married newspaper editor and reporter who fall in love again while investigating the execution of a bookkeeper convicted of murder. His Girl Friday is one of the most iconic examples of the transatlantic accent, a distinctive fast-talking affect originated to imitate the hustle and bustle of upper-crust metropolitan elites. “His Girl Friday is one of the best fast-talking movies of all time,” Gerwig told Letterboxd.

His Girl Friday is available to stream on Prime Video, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Model Shop

Year: 1969

Run time: 1h 37m

Director: Jacques Demy

Cast: Anouk Aimée, Gary Lockwood, Alexandra Hay

Gerwig lists not one, not two, but three Jacques Demy films as principal influences on Barbie. Demy’s flair for carefully constructed worlds with an emphasis on bright colors and complementary costume choices is apparent in Gerwig’s own approach to the pink-saturated wonderworld of Barbie and her friends.

Model Shop is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Modern Times

Year: 1936

Run time: 1h 27m

Director: Charlie Chaplin

Cast: Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman

Charlie Chaplin is the master of cinematic physical humor, a trait evident in nearly of all his films, though especially apparent in this 1936 satirical romance comedy. Barbie’s various stunts and chase sequences owe a debt to the inspiration of Chaplin’s character The Tramp, as Gerwig tells Letterboxd in her interview.

Modern Times is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.

Mon Oncle

Year: 1958

Run time: 2h 35m

Director: Jacques Tati

Cast: Jacques Tati, Jean-Pierre Zola, Adrienne Servantie

Jacques Tati is a master of environmental comedy, known for his elaborately constructed set-pieces that foreground the delightfully clashing personalities of his characters while mischievously critiquing the absurdity of modern society. “Jacques Tati is the king of the slow joke,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “The way those movies unfold are just so perfect. I always thought of Mattel as existing slightly in Jacques Tati’s world.”

Mon Oncle is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.

Pee-wee’s Big Adventure

Year: 1985

Run time: 1h 30m

Director: Tim Burton

Cast: Paul Reubens, E.G. Daily, Mark Holton

Tim Burton’s feature-length adaptation of Paul Reubens’ iconic children’s TV character heavily inspired the fantastical set-pieces and comedic rhythm of Gerwig’s own Barbie. “There’s that section where he gets on a train and is a tramp on a train and sings songs, then he gets bored of it and falls off the train and it takes 60 seconds,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It’s hilarious, but it’s just a really short thing.”

Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Playtime

Year: 1967

Run time: 1h 55m

Director: Jacques Tati

Cast: Jacques Tati, Barbara Dennek, Rita Maiden

As mentioned previously, Tati’s work was a major inspiration for Gerwig’s Barbie. Playtime is often cited as Tati’s magnum opus, following the director’s bumbling protagonist Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself) as he wanders throughout a modern Parisian cityscape cramped with a dioramic assortment of hilarious and strange set-pieces.

Playtime is available to stream on Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.

Rear Window

Year: 1954

Run time: 1h 52m

Director: Alfred Hitchcock

Cast: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey

Alfred Hitchcock’s mystery-thriller about a photographer in a wheelchair who may or may not have witnessed the murder of one of his neighbors in his apartment block is not only one of the director’s most iconic and oft-imitated films, but a surprising influence on Barbie. In her interview with Letterboxd, Gerwig cited the practical construction of the film’s sets and backgrounds as an inspiration while working on her own film.

Rear Window is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Saturday Night Fever

Year: 1977

Run time: 1h 59m

Director: John Badham

Cast: John Travolta, Karen Lynn Gorney, Barry Miller

Barbie is a lot of things: not quite a musical and not quite a drama, but a mish-mash of several different genres with a heavy emphasis on music. Gerwig cites Saturday Night Fever as an influence on her vision for Barbie as a movie supported by an amazing soundtrack. “Saturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. [...] I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie’s sort of — and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco — a little bit dorky in the best way,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “Saturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we’re half of a musical.”

Saturday Night Fever is available to stream on Prime Video and Paramount Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Singin’ in the Rain

Year: 1952

Run time: 1h 43m

Director: Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly

Cast: Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, Debbie Reynolds

Gerwig cites Singin’ in the Rain as not just one of her favorite movies, but her very favorite. It’s no surprise, then, that the film would have an abundant influence on her work on Barbie. “There are so many great things in Singin’ in the Rain, but the dream ballet inside of the dream ballet is one of the most incredible, beautiful, completely unhinged things.”

Singin’ in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Splash

Year: 1984

Run time: 1h 51m

Director: Ron Howard

Cast: Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy

“Splash is another movie that is utterly charming and works emotionally, even though it’s so high concept and it’s down to Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks, who are so great,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “I’m sure the tagline was, like, ‘Fish Out of Water.’ It felt like a crossing-worlds movie… It’s one I’ve loved since I was a kid, too.”

Splash is available to stream on Disney Plus and MGM Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

The Earrings of Madame de…

Year: 1953

Run time: 1h 45m

Director: Max Ophüls

Cast: Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux, Vittorio De Sica

Gerwig cites Max Ophüls’ 1953 romantic drama film as an inspiration on Barbie for its beautiful camerawork. “I mean, I can’t believe some of those shots. They’re just extraordinary; it’s always a reminder of what we’re all going for.”

The Earrings of Madame de… is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.

The Godfather

Year: 1972

Run time: 2h 55m

Director: Francis Ford Coppola

Cast: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan

Francis Ford Coppola’s crime drama masterpiece is one of the most celebrated films of the 20th century, so it’s only natural that Gerwig would find a way to fit a nod to The Godfather in her work on Barbie. If you know, you know.

The Godfather is available to stream on Paramount Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

The Ladies Man

Year: 1961

Run time: 1h 35m

Director: Jerry Lewis

Cast: Jerry Lewis, Helen Traubel, Pat Stanley

Jerry Lewis’ 1961 comedy about a man who takes up a job at a women-only boarding house after breaking up with his girlfriend is a key influence on Gerwig’s Barbie, particularly in its diorama approach to set design and iconic opening moments. “They built this house that was cut out, and then they moved around the rooms with a camera in this one continuous shot with all these girls getting ready,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It’s incredible. That’s where I got the idea for the mirror that has nothing in it that you look through, and it’s just her.”

The Ladies Man is available to stream on Showtime, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

The Philadelphia Story

Year: 1940

Run time: 1h 52m

Director: George Cukor

Cast: Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart

Gerwig cited the 1940 comedy The Philadelphia Story as an influence on Barbie, not just for her love of Cary Grant, but as a inspiration for Margot Robbie’s portrayal of Barbie. “One of the reasons I loved it — and I said to Margot to watch it for Barbie because Katharine Hepburn describes herself as being a Grecian statue or something — is she’s unflappable and then she starts falling apart, and that’s actually where she finds herself,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It was actually already one of Margot’s favorite movies; she already had that in her back pocket, as it were.”

The Philadelphia Story is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

The Red Shoes

Year: 1948

Run time: 2h 15m

Director: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger

Cast: Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring, Moira Shearer

The 1948 British drama about a ballerina who is forced to choose between her love for her career and her love for a composer is a dominant inspiration for Gerwig’s Barbie. “The Red Shoes [is] all over the movie. There’s a shot of her walking up to that house, which I wanted it to feel like that when Barbie walks up to [Weird Barbie’s] house. Ryan Gosling wears a pair of glasses that are the cat-eye glasses that the director wears in it, because I was like, ‘How stylish and bold that that man’s wearing cat-eye glasses — it’s so fun.’ Then Ryan was like, ‘Can I wear cat-eye glasses?’ and I was like, ‘You definitely can,’ and then he had two on.”

The Red Shoes is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.

The Truman Show

Year: 1998

Run time: 1h 43m

Director: Peter Weir

Cast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich

Peter Weir’s contemporary existential comedy about a man who discovers that his entire life has been a carefully orchestrated “reality” TV show shares a lot in common with the spirit of Gerwig’s Barbie. “I had to include The Truman Show both because I watched it again before I made this movie, and because Peter Weir very generously got on the phone with me before I started shooting, and he talked to me for a long time about how he shot it and how they made it work.”

The Truman Show is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

The Umbrellas of Cherbourg

Year: 1964

Run time: 1h 31m

Director: Jacques Demy

Cast: Catherine Deneuve, Anne Vernon, Nino Castelnuovo

As mentioned previously, Jacques Demy was a huge influence on the production design of Gerwig’s Barbie. “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [is] an amazing movie and astonishingly beautiful,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “I loved the use of color and the surrealness. Rodrigo Prieto and I — he shot the film and he’s one of the greatest DPs who ever lived — were talking about that layering of the colors and how you’d shoot five different shades of pink or red in one shot and not have it overwhelm anything, that you feel like there’s separation, but that it’s vibrant. Everything feels painterly, and that was a big part of it.”

The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.

The Wizard of Oz

Year: 1939

Run time: 1h 42m

Director: Victor Fleming

Cast: Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger

The iconic 1939 musical fantasy starring Judy Garland is an obvious inspiration for Gerwig’s film about a girl transported to a world beyond her imagination. “In our movie, we have the Pink Brick Road instead of the Yellow Brick Road,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “We also have beautiful painted backdrops of horizons. We executed it like they would’ve done in the ’30s and ’40s and ’50s soundstage musicals. It was something that we kept returning to. I always love the ending where there’s a ceremonial quality.”

The Wizard of Oz is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

The Young Girls of Rochefort

Year: 1967

Run time: 2h 5m

Director: Jacques Demy

Cast: Catherine Deneuve, George Chakiris, Françoise Dorléac

Jacques Demy’s musical comedy about two extravagantly dressed sisters pining for love was a key influence on Gerwig’s Barbie, particularly for the film’s many flamboyant costume designs. At one point in the film, Barbie sports a hat similar to the sisters’ own.

The Young Girls of Rochefort is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Twentieth Century

Year: 1934

Run time: 1h 31m

Director: Howard Hawks

Cast: John Barrymore, Carole Lombard, Walter Connolly

Gerwig cites Howard Hawks’ screwball romance Twentieth Century as an influence on Barbie’s heightened sense of emotion-driven comedy. “Margot reminds me of Carole Lombard and Ryan reminds me of John Barrymore in how funny he is. There are scenes where they’re just screaming at each other; I was like, ‘This is perfect.’ There’s a heightened, dramatic thing that John Barrymore does that I showed to Ryan, then he took that and put it in our movie.”

Twentieth Century is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.

Wings of Desire

Year: 1987

Run time: 2h 8m

Director: Wim Wenders

Cast: Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander

Among the wide breadth of Gerwig’s inspirations, Wings of Desire might feel like the oddest film to cite as an inspiration for Barbie. It’s a romantic fantasy about an angel that falls in love with a trapeze artist and renounces his immortality in order to spend the rest of his existence on Earth with her, and Gerwig describes the film as an influence for the simple fact that it features conversations with an angel — and that’s it!

Wings of Desire is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.

Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown

Year: 1988

Run time: 1h 28m

Director: Pedro Almodóvar

Cast: Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas, Julieta Serrano

Pedro Almodóvar’s 1988 black comedy about a television actress who embarks on a journey of self-discovery in order to get to the heart of why her lover left her is commonly referred to as one of the director’s best. In the case of Gerwig’s Barbie, the film was an inspiration for its distinctive set design and method of layering colors on screen.

Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is available to stream on Freevee, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzk3Njc1L2JhcmJpZS1tb3ZpZS1pbmZsdWVuY2VzLXN0cmVhbWluZy1ncmV0YS1nZXJ3aWctd2F0Y2gtbmV4dNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzc5NzY3NS9iYXJiaWUtbW92aWUtaW5mbHVlbmNlcy1zdHJlYW1pbmctZ3JldGEtZ2Vyd2lnLXdhdGNoLW5leHQ?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
,Barbie and Ken Could Become the Latest Popular Baby Names,You might be meeting a lot more Barbies and Kens in the future.,"It's Barbie's world and we're just living in it! Greta Gerwig's Barbie is not only getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, but it also won its third weekend in a row at the box office and officially became the latest movie to reach $1 billion worldwide. Not only are people showing up to the movies to see Barbie, but they're also considering honoring the doll in the biggest way possible. According to a new report from People, ""Barbie"" and ""Ken"" are on track to become popular baby names. The baby name website, Nameberry, spoke to the outlet and shared recent data that suggests new moms and dads are getting inspired by the characters played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.

""Barbie and Ken are piquing parents' interest, but this doesn't mean that will translate into actual usage. As of now, Barbie is a predominant Amish name,"" Nameberry Editor-in-Chief Sophie Kihm shared with People. According to the site's data, searches for the name ""Barbie"" have gone up 603% since the film's first trailer dropped in April while ""Ken"" saw a 293% increase.

Despite this increase in popularity, it's too soon to expect to see ""Barbie"" and ""Ken"" on the list of the most popular baby names of the year. In fact, Barbie was ranked 1,896 out of 2,000 popular names heading into the year while Kenneth came in at 113 out of 2,000.

""Barbie and Ken are both dated names that aren't due to comeback yet, so while there may be a slight bump from the movie, neither will be among the most popular baby names of 2023,"" Kihm added.

Margot Robbie Predicts Barbie's Box Office Success:

While some are surprised that Barbie has hit $1 billion at the box office after only two weeks in theaters, the movie's star actually pitched the film as a $1 billion dollar idea.

""I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they're brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director,"" Barbie star Margot Robbie previously told Collider. ""And then I gave a series of examples like, ""dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg,"" that and that, that and that – pretty much naming anything that's been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years. And I was like, ""And now you've got Barbie and Greta Gerwig."" And I think I told them that it'd make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?!""

What Is Barbie About?

In Barbie, to live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you're a Ken.

Cera shared that his agent initially turned down the part under the assumption that the Scott Pilgrim star might not be interested in travelling for the project’s filming in London.

“It was a kind of very last minute casting. My manager got a call checking on my availability for it,” Cera said. “And he called me and he said, ‘I got a call about this movie. It’s the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig’s directing it and it’s filming in London for four months or something. So I told them you probably wouldn’t want to do it because you probably don’t want to go to London.’ I was like, ‘What?! What do you mean? Call them back.’ I mean, he didn’t like blow it or anything, but he’s like, ‘I managed their expectations that you might not wanna do it.’ And I was like, ‘How can I not do it? I need to do it.'”

Thankfully, Cera was able to reach out to Gerwig and discussed the movie through a Zoom meeting. He added, “So somehow I got Greta’s email address, I think through a common friend of ours, and I emailed her. I was like, ‘Can I do that part?’ And she was like, ‘Let’s get on a Zoom right now. Here’s a Zoom link. I’ll be on there for the next hour.’ So she was just hanging out on the Zoom. She’s like ‘Just click that link whenever you’re ready.’ And then we talked about it and it just all happened really fast from there.”

Live-Action Barbie Movie’s Box Office Performance

Since its theatrical release last July 21, Barbie has currently grossed more than $1.9 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the second highest-grossing movie of 2023. Crossing the billion-dollar mark has also made Gerwig the first solo female director to receive this box office achievement. The film is still currently playing in theaters worldwide, which will then be followed by its digital release on September 5.

The film stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Kate McKinnon, Ariana Greenblatt, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, Hari Nef, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren, Dua Lipa and more. It will also feature music from multiple artists including Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj, Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Ice Spice, and K-Pop girl group Fifty Fifty.

Barbie is directed by Oscar nominated filmmaker Greta Gerwig from a screenplay she co-wrote with Noah Baumbach.

2023-07-05 01:16:07+05:30,Barbie: How Greta Gerwig wouldn't take 'no' for an answer from Ryan Gosling to play Ken,Greta Gerwig's unwavering determination paid off as she convinced Ryan Gosling to join the Barbie movie. The Barbie director revealed how she persuaded the actor.,"Greta Gerwig's upcoming Barbie movie has been creating quite a buzz with fans eagerly awaiting its release. Among the reasons for all the excitement are the intriguing themes and setting, but also the star-studded cast that Gerwig managed to assemble. In a recent candid interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, the acclaimed director shared the fascinating story of how she convinced the charming Ryan Gosling to come on board for the film, and it's a tale filled with determination and a touch of serendipity.



How Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken in the Barbie movie

According to Gerwig, there was never anyone else in her mind but Ryan Gosling for the role of Ken in the Barbie movie. The journey to get him on board, however, was not a simple one. Alongside Margot Robbie, who plays Barbie in the movie, Gerwig persisted with unwavering determination, refusing to accept ""no"" as an answer from Gosling.

The moment Margot Robbie signed on for the project, Greta Gerwig knew that Ryan Gosling had to be a part of it too. Despite never having met him before, Gerwig was convinced that Gosling was the perfect fit for the character of Ken. Her certainty about this decision filled her with joy and excitement, and she was determined to make it a reality.

She praised his ability to take his roles seriously, never compromising the integrity of the character for a quick laugh. When it came to discussing the character of Ken, Gerwig engaged in deep and meaningful conversations with Gosling, resulting in a level of character work rarely seen in film collaborations.

The highly anticipated Barbie movie, distributed by Warner Bros., is set to hit the big screens on July 21.

2023-07-05 14:00:03+00:00,"'Barbie' Is an LGBTQ+ Party, Attest Greta Gerwig and Out's Cover Stars","For director Greta Gerwig, bringing LGBTQ+ actors like Out cover stars Alexandra Shipp, Hari Nef, and Scott Evans into Barbieland was a no-brainer.","When Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) set out to direct Barbie — and write the screenplay with her partner, Noah Baumbach — she knew that LGBTQ+ inclusion would be a necessity. While actors Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give life to the OG Barbie and Ken dolls, the film’s Barbieland is filled with Barbies and Kens that reflect the vibrant diversity of the real world — albeit a more colorful version with Dreamhouses, daily beach parties, and bops from divas like Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, Charli XCX, and Ava Max.

“We are opening the doors to the Barbie universe,” Gerwig states in an email interview. “There’s no way we could have told this story without bringing in the LGBTQ+ community, and it was important for us to represent the diversity that Mattel has created with all of the different Barbies and Kens that exist today.”

Out’s cover stars (and Barbieland residents), Hari Nef, Scott Evans, and Alexandra Shipp, all attest to the impact of the Mattel toy brand, which first launched in 1959 and has since grown into the most popular doll in the world. For many queer people, first encountering Barbie — her interchangeable accessories, her exaggerated femininity, her hunky boyfriend, Ken — would become a pivotal moment in their young lives. Barbie was a friend, a possibility, a glamorous vessel of pure fabulosity.

Of course, Barbie also has a problematic past. The prototype’s blond hair, blue eyes, and surreally thin physique are emblematic of the unrealistic beauty standards society imposes on women. But Gerwig knew that the doll was far more than pretty plastic. And she wanted to capture that complexity in her Warner Bros. feature film.

“Since Barbie has had a long history, we had to confront the criticisms head on,” Gerwig says. “We needed to get there before anyone else. Barbie has been equal parts painted a villain and a heroine. We point out and engage with the critics, and at the same time, we celebrate Barbie. She was the first adult doll people could play with. Barbie went to the moon before women could have credit cards. Barbie represents a lot of different things, but in a way, she was a stealthy advocate for women in the workplace and our achievements in society. There are definitely complications with Barbie, but it’s undeniable that she was at the vanguard of moving other things forward.”

HARI NEF, ALEXANDRA SHIPP, SHARON ROONEY, ANA CRUZKAYNE, and EMMA MACKEY as Barbies in Warner Bros. Pictures’ ""BARBIE""

The Oscar-nominated director, now 39, also felt a connection to Barbie from a young age — though she didn’t have the easiest time attaining one. “My mom wasn’t sold on Barbie, so I actually didn’t get my own doll for a while,” she recalls. “But all the girls in my neighborhood had them, so I was able to play with them when I would go over to their houses, and then when they would get tired of them, I would get them as hand-me-downs. But I have a real sense memory of standing in Toys ‘R’ Us looking at Barbie dolls and loving the ones that were in the big boxes. The ones with the big hair. It’s a very vivid, visceral memory of Barbie and what she meant. Finally, one Christmas, my mom caved and got me one. I was so excited.”

Another woman would bring an adult Gerwig back into Barbieland: her star, Margot Robbie (Bombshell, Birds of Prey), who is also a producer of the film. Robbie “invited me on this journey,” Gerwig recalls. “I love her work as an actor, and when we met and talked, I was deeply impressed by her work and viewpoint as a producer. I thought that I would love to make something with her. When she approached me and Noah to write Barbie, I jumped at the chance. Barbie is something everyone knows, all around the world, and everyone has an opinion of her. I couldn’t imagine a richer subject to try and tackle than something that comes with so much feeling already.”

Experience the Barbie feeling more in the profiles of Nef, Evans, and Shipp. And don’t miss the Barbie movie, which comes out in theaters July 21.

7/10/2023 16:14,"Gal Gadot, who was first in mind for Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig for the Barbie role, shows support at the Hollywood premiere",,"It wasn’t just those who are involved with Barbie at the Hollywood premiere last night – in Gal Gadot’s case it was also someone who was almost Barbie. According to Margot Robbie, she and Greta Gerwig had Gal in mind as their first choice.

As she told Vogue:

“Gal Gadot is Barbie energy. Because Gal Gadot is so impossibly beautiful, but you don’t hate her for being that beautiful, because she’s so genuinely sincere, and she’s so enthusiastically kind, that it’s almost dorky. It’s like right before being a dork.”

That is such a great description of Barbie, it actually says more about Margot – that she understands the character so thoroughly and how to play her.

The Barbie shoot didn’t work for Gal though and so it ended up being Margot but Gal showed up to support the movie anyway…in one of the best looks we’ve ever seen on her.

This leather dress is JW Anderson, it’s high fashion, it’s beautifully constructed, and it definitely has the Barbie whimsy with the flouncy skirt that’s meant to look like ruffles. And I love the colour choice, not only because that brown is just so buttery and luxe but because, well, she’s not Barbie, so she’s not there to try and pull focus – she’s there to respect the project, show her support for the artists, look great but not necessarily become the conversation.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhaW5leWdvc3NpcC5jb20vZ2FsLWdhZG90LXdoby13YXMtZmlyc3QtaW4tbWluZC1mb3ItYmFyYmllLXJvbGUtc2hvd3Mtc3VwcG9ydC1hdC1ob2xseXdvb2QtcHJlbWllcmUvNzQzODjSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYWluZXlnb3NzaXAuY29tL2dhbC1nYWRvdC13aG8td2FzLWZpcnN0LWluLW1pbmQtZm9yLWJhcmJpZS1yb2xlLXNob3dzLXN1cHBvcnQtYXQtaG9sbHl3b29kLXByZW1pZXJlLzc0Mzg4L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

Margot, who tackled the leading role of Barbie, has recently been kept busy on a global press tour with other cast members, and made stops in countries such as Australia, South Korea, and Mexico.

Greta Gerwig, who is known for directing past films such as Little Women (2019) and Lady Bird (2017), not only took on the role as director of the upcoming fantasy comedy, but also co-wrote the screenplay with Noah Baumbach.

The Barbie movie not only stars Margot, Ryan, and Dua, but also America Ferrera, Will Ferrell, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, and Simu Liu. Various versions of both the Barbie and Ken dolls will be portrayed, with actress Helen Mirren narrating the film.

The premise of the movie, which has a budget of $100 million, follows Barbie and Ken as they travel to the real world in order to find the true meaning of happiness.

Filming began last year in 2022 at Warner Bros. Studios in England, while some exterior shots were notably filmed outdoors in Los Angeles, such as Venice.

'But when we were actually shooting on Venice Beach, with Margot and Ryan in neon rollerblading outfits, it was fascinating because it was actually happening in front of us,' she explained.

'People would go by Ryan, high-five him, and say, ""Awesome, Ryan, you look great!"" And they wouldn’t actually say anything to Margot. They’d just look at her. It was just surreal. In that moment, she did feel self-conscious.'

Gerwig added, 'And as the director, I wanted to protect her. But I also knew that the scene we were shooting had to be the scene where she felt exposed. And she was exposed, both as a celebrity and as a lady.'

'To be fair, Ryan was like, ""I wish I wasn’t wearing this vest."" But it was a different kind of discomfort.'

This article contains spoilers for ""Barbie.""

I'm a '90s kid. I mean, I was actually a proper child in the '90s. I turned seven in the first year of the 21st century. When most people say they are '90s kids, they really mean they were born in the '80s and had their formative coming of age years in the '90s. Consequently, my relationship to the pop culture of the decade of my birth is rather odd, as those formative years for me were really the early 2000s. Micro-generations make a big difference.

Music, in particular, is a weak spot for me. I missed out on grunge, neo-soul, gangsta rap, and so much more. My popular music awareness started forming around the time of ""Millennium"" by the Backstreet Boys in 1999. So, I have no nostalgia for this era of music or, quite frankly, know much of it. When I decided to go back and listen to music before my time, I went to the '60s and '70s, not the '90s.

My lack of connection to the music of this era prevented me from fully connecting with two music-focused sequences in ""Barbie."" The first involved the Indigo Girls' ""Closer To Fine,"" covered by Brandi and Catherine Carlile, which plays every time Barbie drives her car. I'd never heard this song before. The second is a significant comic showcase for Ryan Gosling and his fellow Kens where they perform a cover of Matchbox Twenty's ""Push,"" incorrectly believing they are wooing the Barbies. I'd only heard the song in passing, so while everyone around me was guffawing at the song choice, I was only lightly chuckling at the scene's intention.

,Simu Liu Sets Record Straight About Awkward Red Carpet Moment With Ryan Gosling,A clip went viral last week in which it seemed like Gosling rudely brushed off his “Barbie” co-star while they posed together during a press event.,"“I’d beach off with this Kenadian again in a heartbeat,” Simu Liu, left, wrote of

“I’d beach off with this Kenadian again in a heartbeat,” Simu Liu, left, wrote of ""Barbie"" co-star Ryan Gosling, right.

Simu Liu is getting Ken-did about how he really feels about his “Barbie” co-star Ryan Gosling.

Last week, resurfaced footage of an odd moment between Gosling (Ken) and Simu Liu (also Ken) went viral. In the clip, Gosling appears to act somewhat coldly toward Liu while they pose together at a press event for the film.

Although the video was shot in June during the Toronto press day for their film, it went viral last week as fans debated whether the stars’ interaction was genuine or just a bit that played off their characters’ feud in the movie.

Liu decided to clear the air on Wednesday via Instagram Story by posting a photo of the two actors smiling next to each at the same event, according to a screenshot captured by NME. In the overlaying text, the “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” star implied that the seemingly tense interaction was totally plastic.

“I’d beach off with this Kenadian again in a heartbeat,” Liu said, referring to the fact that both men are Canadian. “He is the best human in every way, especially when he jokes around with us on the carpet and on set, infecting all of us with his kenergy.”

The “Kim’s Convenience” alum concluded his post with a message about the ongoing Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strikes.

“Now let’s get back to the issues that matter, like supporting our striking actors and writers fighting for fair wages!” Liu wrote.

In the video that went viral last week, Gosling and Liu are standing next to each other for photos when Liu decides to wrap his arm around Gosling’s waist. In response, Gosling looks down at his hand and steps back, appearing to brush off Liu. Gosling says a few words to Liu, which are not audible, and Liu can be heard saying, “It’s too tender? Fair enough,” before the two continue to pose for more photos.

The video was shot ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike that began on July 14. But it struck a chord with social media users last week — presumably because the “Barbie” movie premiered the weekend before, and also because there’s significantly less celebrity news due to the simultaneous Hollywood strikes.

“Oh I’d literally never show my face again,” one Twitter user wrote of the video.

But there were others who felt it was just an act.

“I think it’s their characters playing like they hate each other cause they are in competition with each other in the movie. It ain’t that deep,” wrote another Twitter user.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zaW11LWxpdS1zZXRzLXJlY29yZC1zdHJhaWdodC0yMTE3MjQ2MTYuaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL3NpbXUtbGl1LXNldHMtcmVjb3JkLXN0cmFpZ2h0LTIxMTcyNDYxNi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en

,America Ferrera Caps Off the ‘Barbie’ Press Tour with the Sweetest Look — That You Have to See from the Back,Barbie hits theaters on July 21,"Barbie hits theaters on July 21

Well, isn't Ugly Betty looking gorgeous?

America Ferrera, star of the upcoming summer blockbuster Barbie, has been doling out some incredible red carpet looks. With the release of the movie just a week away, the film’s press tour has come to an end. Before the official close out, Ferrera ended it with a bang.

For her final stop, Ferrera rocked a tight-fitting red Alex Perry dress that hugged her curves perfectly. While a structured shoulder provided the dress an ounce of ‘80s nostalgia, the look was clean and modern. Paired with Ferrera’s naturally flowing locks and some matching red earrings, Ferrera looked like the true movie star that she is.

Then, bam! Ferrera turns around to reveal a stunning heart-shaped cutout spanning the length of her back. The cutout is tasteful but luxurious, adding to the dress’ opulence and providing a sweet sendoff to what has been an epic press tour.

The Superstore actress used her Instagram caption to thank her stylist Karla Welch, writing, “I ❤️ u @karlawelchstylist. Thanks for all the slay.”

Meanwhile, Welch also posted the eye-catching look, using her caption to commemorate the end of the press tour. “Seems like a perfect one to end on,” Welch wrote, before using the hashtag #istandwithsagandwgaandunionseverywhere.

Some of Ferrera’s celebrity friends quickly hopped in to celebrate the iconic fashion moment. “Just beyond,” Blackish star Tracee Ellis Ross commented. Never Have I Ever creator Mindy Kaling dropped a simple “Omfg.”

On Welch’s post, the outpouring of love continued. “WOW,” Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum Lisa Rinna commented. “Holy s---,” celebrity jewelry designer Irene Neuwirth commented. “Amazing.”

While Ferrera may be dripping in luxury for this red carpet appearance, she certainly isn’t always dressed to the nines. On a recent Kelly Clarkson Show appearance, Ferrera told the story of one of the cast’s storied sleepovers. While her castmates may have brought out their nicest, sexiest pajamas, Ferrera went for a different approach.

“I am extremely competitive and nobody told me that it was a sexy Barbie sleepover,” Ferrera said. “So everybody was in, like, really pretty silky nightgowns, and I was in, like, the most grandma floral twin set you could imagine.”

Ryan showed off his generous side in March 2023 when he funded Wrexham’s Under 12s with a new Deadpool-themed kit.

9. When he helpfully produced a song to help fans pronounce Rob McElhenney’s name

Ryan went above and beyond for his pal Rob’s birthday in 2023 and released a highly-produced song – and music video – to assist fans with pronouncing the actor’s surname.

That’s friendship right there.

2023-07-05 10:13:21+01:00,Grandmother reveals she's so obsessed with Barbie that everything in her house is pink,"Two years ago, Arkansas grandmother Dena Daniels decided to live 'her truth' after being teased as a teenager for playing with  dolls - and says she eats, sleeps and breaths Barbie.","A grandmother says she's finally living her lifelong dream of 'being Barbie' by styling her entire home in bright pinks and dressing just like her idol - but has no interest in spending her life with a 'Ken'.

Dena Daniels, from Fort Smith, Arkansas, says Barbie was her favourite childhood doll and she played with them until she got bullied by other children for being too old.

Now, at the age of 54, Dena says she's finally decided to 'live her truth' by 'pink-ifying' her shabby chic home after becoming tired of hiding how she wanted to really live.

Dena eats, sleeps and breathes pink, waking every morning in pink robes and enjoying her morning coffee and toast from a pink coffee pot and toaster - and says she can't wait for the release of the new film starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Reynolds.

She even has a human-size Barbie display case she can pose in as a life-size living doll and is called 'Barbie' by her neighbours.

The mother-of-two had felt that for years she had been hiding her 'authentic self' to please others - particularly men - so decided to paint her home doll-house pink and dye all of her clothes shades of rose to magenta.

While not totally opposed to love, with no men in her life she feels she can 'express herself more' and urges other women to 'get another husband' if they aren't being their authentic selves.

Even though she was dating when she originally turned her home fuchsia, she admits she didn't 'make it available' for him to move in and now she's single says that the home is not designed for any future 'Ken' to be comfortable in.

Dena says the purchase of a moveable life-size Barbie toy box mean she can pose up a storm whenever she likes

Addicted: She says 'Once I got started, I just couldn't stop. It's been a journey of ""how much pink can I add before it gets tacky?"".'

Dena Daniels, from Fort Smith, Arkansas, says she's living her truth after deciding two years ago to paint her house pink and 'eat, sleep and breathe' Barbie

Healing: Dena says Barbie was her favourite childhood doll and she played with them until she got bullied by other children for being too old

The semi-retired grandma and her 'Barbie-core' home have more than 65,700 followers online and more than 846,900 likes on her videos which share her daily life.

Dena said: 'I was concerned about people's approval and pleasing those around me, especially men.

'One day I just woke up and thought 'I'm not getting any younger, I want to do what I want to do. I don't care what anyone else thinks about it, I want to be me'.

'I've always loved Barbie, ever since I was a little girl. I had them and played with them as long as I could until I got made fun of.

'I thought 'I want to turn my house into a real-life Barbie house'.

'I'm not really a collector of them, I just wanted to be the Barbie and my house be the Barbie house. I do have a Barbie house and some Barbie accessories, but I don't put a whole lot into that because I'm the Barbie.

'Honestly, in the beginning I was kind of made fun of. People would say 'you're a full-grown woman, why are you playing with toys?'.

'What's so funny is now everyone's into Barbie. I'm not crazy after all.'

The mother-of-two says she's dyed all her clothes in shades of magenta or rose so she can have a Barbie wardrobe. Pictured in her boudoir, which is decorated in pastel shades of pink

Criticism: She says some people have asked why a grown up woman is so obsessed with the doll

Dena explains that when she wakes up in the morning she puts on her robes and 'of course, everything is pink'.

She then has breakfast using her pink coffee pot and toaster and taking food out of her pink refrigerator, which she cooks in pink cookware and eats of pink plates.

When she goes out, she drives a VW Beetle that waits on her drive - complete with pink wheels and pink hearts on her.

Dena said: 'Once I got started, I just couldn't stop. It's been a journey of 'how much pink can I add before it gets tacky'.'

Since decorating both inside and outside her home, Dena decided she is no longer looking for love, and doesn't want to change her style for a man.

Dena said: 'I do not have a husband, by choice. I think it means I can express myself more. When I moved into the house, I was dating someone but decided on purpose to not make it available for him to move in with me.

'I've lived a lifetime of pleasing others and I decided it was time to please myself.

'Not that a man couldn't be comfortable here, but I don't want a man. I don't want a man to be comfortable here.

She says her Barbie house is 'part of my healing journey. I think healing my inner child is part of that.

'I have dated a few times since I've been single. I've decided it's not for me.

The Barbie theme has even spread to her kitchen utensils, with a fuchsia fridge and pink mixer

Everything now has a pink hue, including Dena's coffee pot and crockery

'The men that I have found in my age bracket are just not what I'm looking for. I'm open to romance, but I'm allowing it to come to me.

'[Some women] say 'if I didn't have a husband, I'd do that'.

'It lets me know how many are not being their true self. I think 'get another house' or 'get another husband'. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for compromise but this house is not a house to accommodate a man, and that's on purpose.'

Recognised at local supermarkets and around town as 'Barbie', the grandma poses in the iconic Barbie box at Halloween, and offers pink treats to children, in the hopes to create a little 'magic' for neighbourhood kids.

Dena said: 'In the neighbourhood they all call me Barbie. I get recognised 'oh you're the pink lady!'. They all call me the pink lady wherever I go. At Halloween, I open it up for the neighbourhood kids to come.

'The little girls go insane, I think it's quite magical to them, so I let them come in and have pink candy and snacks for everyone.

'I do get negative comments, people have said 'you're too old to play with dolls' and 'are you crazy?'.

The semi-retired grandma and her 'Barbie-core' home have more than 65,700 followers online and more than 846,900 likes on her videos which share her daily life

Barbie-core: The semi-retired grandmother says now she's single her home is not designed for any future 'Ken' to be comfortable in

Doll's house: The interiors of her home look just like those that feature in a miniature version of her home

Dena says she'll be hot-footing it down to the cinema to see the new Barbie movie - and will dress just like her idol

'It's the way that I express myself. It's my soul coming out to express itself on the walls.

'I'm not doing anything to harm anyone, I'm expressing my art and my soul.

'I'm an individualist, I despise being like anyone else. It always bugged me to be like everyone else. So, I decided to just be me out loud.'

The Barbie-lover can't wait to see the new film starring Margot Robbie, and hopes to encourage other women to follow their heart in life and not hold back for any man.

Dena said: 'I'll absolutely be going to see the new film, I'll be wearing my pink clothes and carrying my Barbie purse.

'I'd say to other women you should just follow your heart. Go slow, do it bit by bit. Start wearing pink clothes or adding more to one room at a time.'

And how does she deal with detractors? 'Realise that when people say negative things, that's on them. That's something that isn't healed within them.

'It is scary. It isn't easy to paint a house pink and live in a pink house, but it's worth it.'",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjI2NTc4OS9HcmFuZG1vdGhlci1yZXZlYWxzLXNoZXMtb2JzZXNzZWQtQmFyYmllLWhvdXNlLXBpbmsuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjI2NTc4OS9hbXAvR3JhbmRtb3RoZXItcmV2ZWFscy1zaGVzLW9ic2Vzc2VkLUJhcmJpZS1ob3VzZS1waW5rLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-11 14:32:26+01:00,Mother creates Barbie doll with stretchmarks to show they're normal,"Kate Claxton, 35, from Swindon, Wiltshire, suffered from postnatal anxiety and hated her stretchmarks after she gave birth to her daughter, who is now three years old.","A mum who developed stretchmarks while pregnant has painted them on a Barbie doll to show her daughter they are 'perfectly normal'.

Kate Claxton, 35, from Swindon, Wiltshire, suffered from postnatal anxiety and hated her stretch marks after she gave birth to her daughter, who is now three years old.

But after learning to embrace her body insecurity, she wanted to teach her little girl that they were nothing to worry about as she grew up.

Her daughter is now a massive fan of Barbies but children's author Kate said she could not find any dolls which represented her own body.

So she decided to paint stretch marks on a doll herself using nail varnish and has now urged manufacturers Mattel to do the same.

Kate Claxton, 35, from Swindon, Wiltshire, painted stretchmarks on a Barbie doll to set an example for her daughter

The children's author, pictured with her daughter when she was a baby, said she wanted to normalise stretch marks, but couldn't find any dolls with the common skin feature

Kate said: 'My daughter has really started getting into Barbies recently and I almost recoiled when I bought her first one.

'It was typically Barbie-like - perfectly proportioned, long legs, blonde hair. We've since bought other versions with vitiligo, prosthetic legs and fuller figures.

'So to their credit, they do more inclusive dolls but I could not find one anywhere with stretch marks.

'I have written a children's book about stretch marks and when I came to research it I found 96 per cent of women have them.

'But there aren't any dolls representing how normal this is, so I thought I would do one myself.

'I would love the manufacturers to make some Barbies with stretch marks to spread the message that they are nothing to worry about,' Kate explained

Kate has previously written a self-published children's book My Mum's a Tiger which has sold 13,000 copies worldwide, about a girl who learns why her mum has 'stripes' on her skin

'When you look up stretchmarks it's all about creams and treatments to get rid of them and I found little evidence of people embracing them.

'And that's what I think mums need to do, accept they are perfectly normal and let their children know the same.

'Women are more likely to end up with stretch marks than have blonde hair so I think it's about time Barbie got on board and made a doll to represent this.

'Children should know stretch marks are natural for mummies, and any other women for that matter, to have.

'There are many ways for people to be 'normal' and I believe kids should learn that from a young age. I didn't want to pass my body hang-ups on to my daughter.

'I would love the manufacturers to make some Barbies with stretch marks to spread the message that they are nothing to worry about.

Kate said that stretch marks affect 96 per cent of women and urged mothers to teach their daughters that they're totally natural

'I just believe it's really important to expose our children to as much diversity as possible.'

Kate, who lives with husband Tony, 36, said she had her own insecurities about her body after giving birth and also had stretch marks as a teenager.

The mum-of-one added: 'They really came out towards the end of my pregnancy and I hated them at first, but now I'm proud of them.

'I just used nail varnish to achieve the effect, I didn't use one of my daughter's current dolls, as it's now too toxic to play with.

Kate used nail varnish to create the illusion of stretch marks and then sparked a conversation with her daughter while dressing the doll

'But I had a conversation with her about what they were. We decided to get the doll changed and she didn't mention the stretch marks.

'So hopefully they are already something completely normal to her and she won't worry about them as she gets older and that's what I wanted to achieve.

'She knows mummy has got stretch marks, and they're not a big deal.'

Kate has previously written a self-published children's book My Mum's a Tiger which has sold 13,000 copies worldwide, about a girl who learns why her mum has 'stripes' on her skin.

The former theatre marketing manager added: 'This is already something which is an important issue to me, having written the book when my daughter was three months old

'Children who have read the book ask if their mums have stripes and the feedback is that it has given a lot of women confidence to show their stretch marks.

'I just think there's more ways of promoting this and with the Barbie film coming out too, I think Barbie should get on board.'

Last year Mattel introduced a Barbie's Fashion Doll line which focused on disability representation and diversity inclusion.

They include dolls with Down's syndrome, a hearing aid, vitiligo, a prosthetic limb and a wheelchair as part of their 'most diverse and inclusive doll line'.

Previously in 2016, the toy giant released dolls with fuller figures, a petite and tall Barbie as well as different ethnicities.

The original Barbie doll launched in 1959 featuring long legs, a tiny waist and flowing blonde locks and faced criticism that it perpetuated unrealistic beauty standards.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjI4Njk4OS9Nb3RoZXItY3JlYXRlcy1CYXJiaWUtZG9sbC1zdHJldGNobWFya3MtdGhleXJlLW5vcm1hbC5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL2ZlbWFpbC9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMjg2OTg5L2FtcC9Nb3RoZXItY3JlYXRlcy1CYXJiaWUtZG9sbC1zdHJldGNobWFya3MtdGhleXJlLW5vcm1hbC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-09 14:03:59+00:00,Report: Barbie Spin-off Movie Focused on Ken in Development,"Although the Barbie movie has yet to have its premiere, a recent report suggests that a Ken spin-off movie may already be in development.","Although the Barbie movie has yet to have its premiere, a recent report suggests that a Ken spin-off movie may already be in development.

According to a recent report from Daniel Richtman (via World of Reel), a Ken spin-off movie with Ryan Gosling attached to star is in the works at Warner Bros. Discovery. It’s in the early stages, so it’s unknown who would be writing, directing, or even working on the project should it be true.

However, with the popularity of Barbie continuing to climb ahead of the film, and with it projected to be very successful at the box office, this might not be too surprising. Currently, Barbie is projected to earn anywhere from $80-100m during its opening weekend, a huge number especially when considering it will be launching alongside Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated Oppenheimer.

What is Barbie about?

“To live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken,” reads the synopsis.

Barbie is directed by Oscar-nominee filmmaker Greta Gerwig from a screenplay she co-wrote with Noah Baumbach. Joining Robbie are Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Kate McKinnon, Ariana Greenblatt, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, Hari Nef, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren, Dua Lipa and more.

The film is produced by Robbie and Tom Ackerly for LuckyChap and Mattel Films’ Robbie Brenner, along with Josey McNamara and Ynon Kreiz. This marks Robbie’s latest collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures after starring as fan-favorite anti-hero Harley Quinn in 2016’s Suicide Squad, 2020’s Birds of Prey, and 2021’s The Suicide Squad.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L21vdmllcy9uZXdzLzEzMDQzMzYtcmVwb3J0LWJhcmJpZS1zcGluLW9mZi1tb3ZpZS1mb2N1c2VkLW9uLWtlbi1pbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L21vdmllcy9uZXdzLzEzMDQzMzYtcmVwb3J0LWJhcmJpZS1zcGluLW9mZi1tb3ZpZS1mb2N1c2VkLW9uLWtlbi1pbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-CA&gl=CA&ceid=CA:en
2023-07-03 18:05:05+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Director Greta Gerwig To Jump From The Pink Planet To The Fantasy World, The $745 Million Rich Narnia Franchise & Here’s All You Need To Know!","Greta Gerwig, who is currently gearing up for the release of Barbie, has bagged a deal with Netflix for movies based on Chronicles of Narnia. Read on!","Director Greta Gerwig is currently gearing up for the release of her visionary project Barbie, which she has been working on for a long time now. The filmmaker is already being lauded for keeping in mind various minute details in the upcoming film. While she is currently on a promotional spree for the project, she already has a deal in her kitty for another fantasy world with Netflix.

Barbie stars an ensemble cast including Margot Robbie, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Mackie, Simu Liu and Will Farrell. The movie is set to hit the theatres on July 21, and there is a lot of buzz around it for its unique concept.

Greta Gerwig is known for her projects, such as Lady Bird and Little Women. She is entering a new world of imagination with her upcoming film Barbie. However, her dreamy world will not end there, as she already has a deal with Netflix for writing and directing at least two movies based on C.S. Lewis’ book series, The Chronicles of Narnia.

In her recent profile for The New Yorker, Gerwig confirmed that she had been given the project by the streaming giant. However, the big question that comes after the report is which part of the book series Greta Gerwig’s new visionary project will cover. It is still expected to revolve around the White Witch’s attempt to take over Narnia and the Pevensie kids fighting her with the help of Aslan.

For the unversed, Netflix acquired the rights to Lewis’ book series The Chronicles of Narnia for a multi-year deal for both movie and TV series adaptations. Earlier, Disney and Fox had made a trilogy based on the fantasy story from 2005 to 2010. The film franchise included The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. One must note that the box office collection of the first instalment in the film series was $745 million.

Seeing the world Greta Gerwig has created for the Margot Robbie starrer, and she might be the right person for more projects based on fantasy books.
