            "text": "Both \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Barbie\" premiere this Thursday, with internet phenomenon \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d poking fun at their shared premiere date amid diametrically opposed genres. \"Oppenheimer\" follows American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb in an R-rated film, while the PG-13 rated \"Barbie\" movie explores the self-discovery of childhood toy favorites Barbie and Ken. Whether you want to start with a familiar favorite, or end on a more friendly note, there are numerous theatres where you can enjoy both movies \u2013 even back-to-back - on premiere day.

            "text": "This transcript was created using speech recognition software. While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. So we drove out to the Midwest for vacation. And so I was like, oh, we\u2019ll just audiobook it. And between the drive back and forth, I barely had covered half of the book because it was like 27 hours or something ridiculous. Wait, you subjected your family to the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d audiobook? They loved it. Or they lied to me. Either way. Well, I mean, I read it when it came out. It\u2019s like 17 years ago, so I mean, I don\u2019t remember. So once wasn\u2019t enough. I just remember that it was great. Nerd. Uh-huh. So I had to read it again. Right, sure. Nerd! [MUSIC PLAYING] From New York Times Opinion, I\u2019m Ross Douthat. I\u2019m Michelle Cottle. I\u2019m Carlos Lozada. And I\u2019m Lydia Polgreen. And this is \u201cMatter of Opinion.\u201d So last week, Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d came out, and all four of us saw it. Not together. Not together, except in spirit, but so did a lot of other people. The movie has already made more than 80 million bucks at the box office. Now, if you haven\u2019t seen it, I don\u2019t know that anything we\u2019ll discuss is the biggest spoiler, given that the movie is based on extremely famous historical events, but we probably shouldn\u2019t promise not to have any spoilers, right? Spoiler, the good guys won World War II. Oh, well, that itself is a controversial statement, Carlos, but we\u2019ll be talking about whether the movie is really about the good guys, what its moral vision is, what it says about when politics and potentially world ending science collide. But we\u2019ll start with the basics. What did everybody think about the movie? Silence. Come on, come on. What did you \u2014 let\u2019s hear it. I\u2019m going to jump in. Fun family fair. I\u2019m going to jump in. I thought the movie was spectacular. It\u2019s obviously going to generate some controversy about whether they were too soft on communism or made Oppenheimer too much of a hero, but it was ambitious. It was, of course, gorgeous. There were some weirder moments in it that are kind of Christopher Nolan\u2019s forte, but on the whole, it took what was a sweeping, huge book, \u201cAmerican Prometheus.\u201d It won the Pulitzer. It is well worth a read and really gives it a good narrative that drives you through what is an unacceptable three hours. No movie should be three hours. But this one was good enough that I didn\u2019t start to fidget like a four-year-old until about 2 and 1/2 hours in, which is always a good sign. Carlos, what did you think? I really enjoyed it. I wasn\u2019t as troubled by the length because it sort of tells two stories. It tells the story of the race to design and test the atom bomb. And then it tells the story of how Oppenheimer was sort of cast aside by the very government that had deployed him for war-making purposes when he was no longer useful, when he became kind of an irritant. And I mean, those stories are woven together in the movie. So to me, since there was so much that was worth getting into, I wasn\u2019t troubled by the length. I didn\u2019t think it was too long at all. I love a biopic. I love an epic book. I love an epic movie. I mean, the performances, I thought, were incredible. And I have to say, I was astonished by the box office numbers that so many people wanted to see this movie because I think most people who go to the movies during summer blockbuster season aren\u2019t necessarily looking to be challenged in this way. But yeah, I found myself quite swept up with it. Yeah, so the box office was remarkable. And since one of my big things is the decline and fall of the American movies and so on, I feel churlish saying anything negative about \u201cOppenheimer\u201d because it is terrific that it did so well. And Nolan is terrific, and the cast was terrific. I wasn\u2019t sure about the last hour of the movie. So it does this sort of \u2014 there\u2019s sort of the central forward momentum narrative carrying you through the Manhattan Project, culminating in the big explosion, right, which comes about 2/3 of the way through the movie. And then there\u2019s the aftermath in the 1950s, which takes two forms. You follow both Oppenheimer through the sort of closed, unfair kangaroo court hearing where he loses his security clearance over his various ties to the many communists who were associated with his social and intellectual world in the 1930 and \u201840s. And then you also get the failed nomination to Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s cabinet of Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey, Jr., in a really terrific performance. Strauss was a Republican hawk, and Oppenheimer famously became a critic of arms race politics. But so the movie is sort of culminating in Lewis Strauss not getting the Secretary of Commerceship. And you can see what Nolan is doing here, but honestly, to me, there was just a pretty big gap between the drama of the literal atomic bomb and the drama of Lewis Strauss\u2019s cabinet nomination. And in the end, I felt like that was an artistic failure. I totally get your point, but in a blockbuster movie, you have to have a villain. And who are we going to make the villain in a movie like this? It\u2019s a very complicated, weird subject. And you had to have an antagonist for Oppenheimer. I actually disagree, and I think it\u2019s actually a fascinating artistic choice because watching this movie, I thought, so much of it takes place in kind of the perfect setting for a film that is, in a lot of ways, about the professional managerial class. These dramas take place in these incredibly claustrophobic, bureaucratic, drab meeting rooms. And the only reason that you know that this is an incredibly important proceeding is that you have this assaultive score that\u2019s coming at you with these incredible strings playing. And I think that there is this symmetry that feels very real to me. I guess it\u2019s a metaphorical symmetry between the very real destruction of the atomic bomb and the very real power of personal grudges and spite between members of the professional managerial class over petty politics and power. So to me, that felt like a central tension and storyline of the entire movie. I agree that that\u2019s a critical element of this story. And in some ways, just as dramatic as the race to develop the bomb, you can imagine the movie focusing on the Trinity test and then on Oppenheimer\u2019s transformation, and sort of an activist against the H-bomb worrying about what he had unleashed. But the story is about how the government turns against him, how it found him dangerous. And something kind of remarkable is that I don\u2019t know if you all saw the story, but just like last December of this past year, the Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, finally nullified the commission\u2019s revoking of Oppenheimer\u2019s security clearance, saying that it had been, as more information came out about what the hearing had been like and the unfairness of the process, that they just couldn\u2019t stand by it. I like the fact that the book and the movie really drive home how confusing a political time this was. So like well before the bomb or the hearings, you had this whole concern about, on the one hand, the Nazis, and this is the major race you\u2019re fighting off. But even before Oppenheimer was drafted for this project, just like so much churn about communism. And so you had these two competing tensions, and he almost didn\u2019t wind up in charge of the project because of his relationships. I think people forget what just kind of a weird global time that was. And this does a really good job of just trying to drive home how much cloud there was around everything. Yeah, well, I mean, it feels weird to say this with a three-hour movie, but you\u2019re struck by all the things that they kind of had to leave out. You see how, in the movie, he\u2019s this kind of immediately charismatic professor at Berkeley, right? It starts with one student, and then suddenly it\u2019s packed because he\u2019s so captivating. He was actually a terrible teacher initially. He was unintelligible. He taught himself slowly to become a better teacher. And that cult of Oppie kind of grew up around him. What Michelle mentions about the ferment of the moment is sort of even more alive in the book, even around physics. The movie kind of glosses over this because you don\u2019t want to spend too much time on it, besides like, oh, look at all these cool formulas on a chalkboard, you know? But his genius was in helping others crystallize the ideas that they would pursue. And there\u2019s a moment in the movie when I think the Matt Damon character, Groves, asks him, why he hasn\u2019t won a Nobel Prize yet? Because everyone around him had Nobel\u2019s. It\u2019s super stressful when you\u2019re like the one guy with no Nobel. Tell me about it. And it\u2019s that the Nobel\u2019s were awarded for super specific, deep contributions to a particular field. And Oppenheimer was kind of interested in everything. He was too distracted for that. He was a great enabler and crystallizer of other people\u2019s ideas. I think one of the interesting things about that particular moment in physics and science, right, is that prior to World War II, prior to the Manhattan Project, there was still a way in which science was operating outside of what we now think of as kind of the American university model. It was much more European. There\u2019s a really strong aristocratic vibe. And Oppenheimer himself is much \u2014 he\u2019s rich, right? He\u2019s a rich kid. I\u2019m not sure this is completely, completely conveyed in the movie, though it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s vacationing in New Mexico. Yeah, he basically puts the Manhattan Project where he likes to go for vacation, right? It would be like, if you were like, well, I really like this little town on the coast of Maine. Let\u2019s build the atomic bomb there. And there are a couple local lobster fishermen, but they won\u2019t object. I guess I wonder what, as the resident reactionary, I thought the movie up till the sort of final 30 minutes was actually quite effective in making a case that maybe Oppenheimer, once the project was over, shouldn\u2019t have a security clearance. I mean, I think the movie does a good job of portraying Oppenheimer as a very complicated, fairly unstable figure, someone who literally poisoned the apple of his professor while in graduate school, someone who was friends with tons of communists, ran a program that was successfully infiltrated by communists, apparently only had sex with either communists or ex-communists. His brother was a communist, don\u2019t forget. His brother is a communist. The question is, should he have this security clearance? And the moment when Leslie Groves, played really well, as always, by Matt Damon, testifies and is asked based on the current Cold War era security guidelines, would Oppenheimer pass muster, and he has to say no, I mean, he\u2019s right, isn\u2019t he? Yeah. Although I thought the line was great because he said, no, but under the current system, I\u2019m not sure I would have cleared any of these guys, which kind of gets to the period where scientists didn\u2019t automatically going to think of themselves as extensions of the political argument. But it gets to the period where under the circumstances of a war against national socialism and imperial Japan, you have to say, yeah, if the best scientists are sort of compromised by associations with communism, it doesn\u2019t matter. You have to have them in there. But then, once you\u2019re in a Cold War environment with Soviet Russia, you probably wouldn\u2019t run the Manhattan Project the same way. I think that\u2019s right, but I think that there\u2019s also, to your point, Ross, there\u2019s a sort of a noblesse oblige around Oppenheimer. And that, I think, goes hand in hand with another big theme of the book and the movie, which is his kind of naivete. You see him floating in this world of ideas and theory and communism and the Spanish Civil War as a romantic cause. And all of those things are true. But they\u2019re all taking place in an environment that\u2019s outside of hard politics and more in the realm of the theoretical. And I think that what you\u2019re seeing in the film is this, and actually in history, is this move towards a much harder and more concrete reality in which the people in this world actually have to deal with the consequences of theory. And it seemed that he saw losing his place in the establishment, the inner circle of decision making about what the future of the country should be, and how we should be dealing with these weapons, that it was a huge loss for him to lose his seat at the table inside. And he assigned basically zero value to the kind of moral mantle that he could and I think did pick up. It really gets at this kind of like professional managerial class and sort of noblesse oblige clashing. Yeah, there\u2019s a piece from Vox on that last point by Haydn Belfield that\u2019s called \u201cCrybaby Scientist\u201d that basically is just a \u2014 if you want to read the most anti-Oppenheimer take in this movie environment, that\u2019s the place to go. And Belfield basically argues a version of what you just said, Lydia, that this was a guy who imagined himself as this core decision-maker, but who basically invented the bomb and gave it to the national security state and then was totally unable to manage or master the forces that he\u2019d unleashed, while maintaining his desire to be seen as someone who was the insider sort of steering the ship. I think the piece is unfair to Oppenheimer in many ways, but it\u2019s worth reading the strong anti-Oppenheimer take, which is also another question for you guys. There\u2019s also been a lot of criticism of the movie from the left, arguing that it\u2019s just too kind to Oppenheimer. It doesn\u2019t spend enough time on the actual realities of what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, once again, Americans whitewashing their own evils via Hollywood. What do you guys think of that critique? My response to that is my response to a lot of these things, which is that not every movie or every piece is about everything. So this was about Oppenheimer. You can focus it on that. I mean, we can have another three-hour biopic on what about the fallout in New Mexico. I mean, there\u2019s been talk about it has ignored what happened with the people who were downwind of the Trinity test. Yes, all of these are like questions, but again, not every movie is about every piece of a puzzle. It\u2019d have to be longer than three hours, Michelle. And you already oppose that, so. No, I object on moral principle to movies that are that long. I think, first of all, it was a real choice not to portray or show anything from what actually happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which was utter and total and complete devastation. And when I finished the movie, I took the subway home and then immediately read John Hersey\u2019s \u201cHiroshima,\u201d which is an extraordinary book that really kind of gives you a sense of what took place there. And I think at the end of the day, I actually think that the way that the movie handled it was probably right. It would have felt, I think, somewhat gratuitous to go outside of the narrative of the movie and have newsreel footage or something that sort of gestured at the kind of destruction that this bomb actually wrought. And I felt that the moment where he\u2019s speaking to a cheering, flag waving crowd, and they\u2019re stomping their feet at Los Alamos, excited and celebrating that they\u2019ve won the war by dropping this bomb on what was arguably a largely defeated enemy, he sort of has this kind of moment of conscience and what have you. So I think that was probably the right way to handle that. But the thing that was wild to me is there\u2019s this moment where Oppenheimer says, sort of justifying the use of the bomb, that demonstrating the destruction of it will be so great that it\u2019ll usher in the greatest peace that mankind has ever known. And in one regard, he was right in the sense that no one has ever deployed a nuclear weapon in a conflict situation since then. But in another way, we have not actually seen the greatest peace humankind has ever seen since then. So I don\u2019t know. To me, that moment in the film really stuck with me. Yeah, there\u2019s a moment when I think they\u2019re showing images from the actual atomic bombings are being shown. And I think you see Oppenheimer looking away from it. Right? So in a way, the movie is giving his perspective and his sort of showing that for all his guilt and so on and sort of nightmares, there\u2019s sort of the nightmare scene that you referenced, Lydia, of the jeering crowd with the sort of undertones of atomic destruction underneath it. For all that, Oppenheimer is also sort of maybe refusing to see, right? The movie doesn\u2019t show you because Oppenheimer himself does not want to fully see what he did. The authors make a distinction between Oppenheimer taking responsibility, like yes, he made this thing, but not feeling guilt over it. And I felt that that was somewhat portrayed in the movie. What I liked, Ross, about that moment you mentioned when Oppenheimer looks away is that you see the colleagues around him, they\u2019re all flinching. They\u2019re watching. And it\u2019s it\u2019s painful for them. But he sees something and then immediately looks away. Well, and what\u2019s also interesting is the justification, and I think actually, this has sort of become the conventional wisdom, was that even though Japan was on the verge of defeat, dropping the bomb saved lives, and you sort of see that in the amazing scene of Gary Oldman playing Harry Truman, sort of waving away the histrionic Oppenheimer saying he has blood on his hands. So yes, I mean, I think this notion that ultimately dropping the bomb saved lives has become the kind of conventional wisdom. And \u201cThank God for the Atomic Bomb,\u201d which is a very influential essay by Paul Fussell in \u201cThe New Republic,\u201d which was published in 1981, I think really sort of articulates that view. But I also think one of the things about the legacy of the atomic world in which we live that nobody really ever talks about is the Cold War had real consequences, and the fact that it couldn\u2019t take place as a direct confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States meant that it pushed the conflict out into essentially the decolonized world, right? And the proxy wars of the Cold War, I mean, it\u2019s, depending on how you do the math, somewhere between 10 and 25 million people died, depending on when you start counting and who you count. But wars in Vietnam, in Congo, in Ethiopia, which is my mother\u2019s native land, Guatemala, all across Latin America. So it is interesting that there\u2019s this kind of binary choice between the peace and never having a nuclear war, but boy, did it set off a huge number of proxy wars that just happened to have as its victims, not the people of the United States or Russia, but the people of largely the developing, poor, Black, Brown world. Yeah, and I don\u2019t think you get a sense of that complexity from the end of the movie. My reading, at least, of the end of the movie is, is much more sort of binary, that it\u2019s not that Oppenheimer created this sort of complex, new world where maybe direct superpower conflict becomes rarer, but proxy wars become more common. Instead, the movie ends with this vision of atmospheric destruction, fire spreading across all of the Earth, the true apocalypse that we\u2019ve all lived in some kind of fear of ever since the 1940s. So in that sense, it\u2019s presenting a vision of just sort of science slipping away from all political control and/or politics just doing what it will with terrifying technology. So let\u2019s take a quick break here. And when we come back, we\u2019re going to try and bring the conversation about the intersection of science and politics off the movie screen, out of the past, and into the present. So we\u2019ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we\u2019re back. So we\u2019re going to talk now for a minute about not just what the story of Oppenheimer says about history and the early Cold War and the life of the man himself, but about our own future here, 80 years onward in the beginning of the 21st century, where the question hanging over lots of issues, nuclear biowarfare and biotechnology, now artificial intelligence, is, can human beings control and tame the technologies that we create that might have potentially world destroying consequences? So, for all of you watching a three-hour movie about the first time, arguably, the human race created such a technology, did it fill you with optimism about the human capacity to restrain itself once we\u2019ve let certain genies out of the bottle? I don\u2019t think we need to be feeling so optimistic. It\u2019s not been around for that long. There\u2019s still plenty of time for us to blow ourselves up, Ross. So there\u2019s this one amazing moment in the book that I was hoping would appear in the movie, and that\u2019s that when Oppenheimer dies, one of his three eulogists is George Kennan. So you have the father of the atom bomb being eulogized by the father of containment. And containment, of course, was the policy that, depending on how you interpret it, helped keep the two superpowers from going to war with one another with nuclear weapons. He has an amazing line in the eulogy. He says, on no one did there ever rest with greater cruelty the dilemmas evoked by the recent conquest by human beings of a power over nature out of all proportion to their moral strength. So it did not leave me with much optimism. There\u2019s also this interesting development where Congress has looked at this movie and taken the opportunity to reintroduce some ideas about how to get their arms around it. I mean, we\u2019ve seen Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts hawking his proposal to ban AI from launching nuclear weapons. Now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere, but it\u2019s got a very Dr. Strangelove doomsday machine feel to it. But it is what it is. Yeah, I mean, I think it\u2019s so interesting because as I was watching the movie, I actually thought a little bit about \u2014 and don\u2019t be mad at me. I thought a little bit about Elon Musk. [LAUGHS]: Lydia. He is not the kind of Sanskrit-reading sophisticate that Oppenheimer was. And he is also clearly of a different kind of political set of commitments, if you can even call them commitments, than Oppenheimer. But just looking at the various points of view that he\u2019s taken, I think Musk shares this quality of bizarre naivete about the way that politics actually works. And I think like Oppenheimer, Elon Musk is a great synthesizer, perhaps not a great engineer of his own right. But there is this kind of protean quality that Elon Musk has. And in his naive replies to right-wing, even anti-Semitic and other people with those kinds of political views on Twitter, I do see kind of shades of a very crude version of Oppenheimer, which makes me feel like we\u2019re in for a fair bit more of this kind of, quote unquote, \u201cinnovation\u201d that is hurling forward without really thinking a great deal about it. I mean, Elon Musk has just announced that Twitter is going to become a company called X, which will be an everything company that is driven by AI and do banking and God knows what else. So hold on to your butts, guys. This is coming for us. But what\u2019s interesting with Musk is that he is also a bit of an AI doomer, right, in the sense that he has been sort of supportive of some of the people calling for a pause in AI research. And a certain amount of Musk\u2019s fascination with space travel rests on his professed fears about human extinction, the idea that we\u2019re going to blow ourselves up in some way, shape, or form. Yeah, Musk is sort of skeptical. But in some ways, that\u2019s the most dangerous, right? Because I think so was Oppenheimer, right? Like, there\u2019s this quality of being both aware of and smart enough to know how destructive this thing could be, but also so smart and so curious and driven that you can\u2019t help but want to push it as far as it can go. And it\u2019s actually exactly in the hands of someone like Elon Musk, who professes to understand the dangers, but nonetheless hears the siren song of the future calling and of innovation and of science and of technology and sort of can\u2019t resist following where it leads. Let me just play, I guess, devil\u2019s advocate for a minute on the specific nuclear question, which I think is, it\u2019s true, as Michelle said, that we\u2019ve only had nuclear weapons for 80 years, 80 odd years, slightly less. And it is very hard for me to imagine a future in which they\u2019re never used. There\u2019s sort of a Chekhov\u2019s gun quality to nukes in the world. At the same time, we do have multiple generations now of evidence that human beings, when given this awesome power, power to destroy whole countries, if not the whole world, do flinch from it, right? The idea that if you hand human beings an awesome, terrifying technology, they will just use it, has not been vindicated. So far, politics has actually worked to contain the use of nuclear weapons. The fear of AI is that it\u2019s the fear of something that makes decisions that aren\u2019t human anymore, that lead to destruction not through the sort of normal human power games and rivalries and so on that we\u2019re all familiar with, but through some sort of alien computational logic, where it makes sense to fire all the nukes at once. And that, to me, feels like a difference between some of the fears we have now and the fears people had at the start of the nuclear age. Now it\u2019s more like, well, we know what human nature is like, and we haven\u2019t used the weapons, but we don\u2019t know what AI is like. And maybe AI will use them. What do you guys think of that? I mean, there\u2019s questions about loose nukes, dirty nukes. Obviously, the war in Ukraine, Putin is, I think, not a stable figure. But I do think the point that we have greater faith in the known frailty of human decision-making over the unknown power of AI decision-making and of rationality is a really important one. And I think that in some ways, it connects us back to the film in that science actually should be under the control of politics because in a moment where we\u2019re all talking about we need to follow the science, follow the science, science is a method. It\u2019s not an answer. It is a way of thinking about the world. And it needs to be balanced by other ways of thinking about the world. And those other ways include politics. They include religion. They include all kinds of ways that human beings organize their affairs and think about their values and things like that. So to me, it\u2019s absolutely critical that AI stays as far away from these kinds of decisions as possible. Yeah, and I don\u2019t think we have to limit this just to, say, AI and nuclear weapons. I mean, we did just come through a pandemic where there were serious questions about whether this came out of a scientific experimental lab that then takes its toll on the entire planet. I mean, and it\u2019s just like people operate as though the unthinkable won\u2019t happen until, of course, the unthinkable does happen. And even if what the COVID-19 pandemic wound up coming from wasn\u2019t, in that case, a lab, which we may just never know, that doesn\u2019t mean that the next one won\u2019t. And we have all of these things going on scientifically that we just don\u2019t have a good grasp on or as good a grasp as we should have. I think one thing that would be certainly more useful is if there is just an ongoing, vibrant conversation among all those arenas that Lydia mentioned \u2014 science, politics, ethics, religion. And to the extent that a movie like \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and a book like \u201cAmerican Prometheus\u201d cannot lionize scientists and say like, they\u2019ve got the answers. If only we\u2019d listened, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But rather, enable this more of a give and take among these fields, I think would be better off. Well, on that eloquent note, we\u2019ll leave it there. And when we come back, we\u2019ll be talking about the geopolitical metaphors hidden inside the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie. No, I\u2019m kidding. When we come back, we\u2019re going to get hot and cold. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we\u2019re back. And now it\u2019s time for Hot, Cold, where one of us shares something that we\u2019re into or over or somewhere on the thermometer in between. And Michelle, I think you have something for us. All right, it is perfection that Ross has mentioned \u201cBarbie\u201d because what I am hot on this week is the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Now, I\u2019m not talking about the movies. I saw both of them. I enjoyed both of them. But what I enjoyed even more was the way that this phenomenon, which is for those who haven\u2019t been paying attention, kind of the portmanteau sprung up on social media because these two wildly different blockbusters were opening the same weekend, a challenge sprung up for people to go see both movies. I love this because we\u2019re at a period where going to the theater has become a rare event. And seeing movies as a shared experience is happening less and less and less. So for something like this to pop up just felt kind of delightfully communal. Movie theaters were hosting costume parties and encouraging people to come in their pork pie hats or their pink outfits. And you just had these groups of people, especially with the Barbie crew, including my friends and I, taking pictures of each other, complimenting each other\u2019s outfits in the theater. It just had this feel, which was so unusual at this point in time. And it\u2019s something that I think we need, especially after the last few years of isolation and grimness and pandemic horror, just for people to have a moment where they can come together, no matter how silly it is, and share this sort of thing. And celebrate the invention of the atomic bomb. Yes, that\u2019s all \u2014 Hey, you can argue that Mattel and Barbie have been its own kind of destructive force as well. Well, that\u2019s for a future episode. I was going to say that Mark Harris, the film writer, said something, I think, on Twitter about how often unexpected hits are more sort of shocking and disruptive in Hollywood than unexpected busts. And I think the hope right now for people who like the movies would be that Barbenheimer, combined with the disappointment surrounding many, many superhero sequels and Indiana Jones reboots and so on, will have some kind of substantial effect in what kind of movies get greenlit and made over the next couple of years, assuming, of course, that the writers\u2019 strike ever ends, and that Hollywood ever gets back to making movies in the first place. This reminds me of a few years ago when Steve Martin was hosting the Academy Awards, and he started off saying, look, I don\u2019t know if you all know this, but I\u2019m really especially happy to host this year\u2019s Academy Awards because all the proceeds from tonight\u2019s event are going to massive corporations. So not to be a Barben whiner, but I don\u2019t take such joy in kind of being manipulated effectively by this kind of massive marketing campaign surrounding these two movies. If you\u2019re waiting for purity in your communal experience, you\u2019re going to die lonely. This is America. I don\u2019t think so. I think there are other ways to be communal beyond paying $35 for popcorn and a soda. I\u2019m just saying, we\u2019ve got to find a way to bring people back to communal events, rather than sitting in their basements watching Netflix all the time. Then I\u2019m all for that. I agree, and I think I\u2019ve really been bitten by the movie bug lately. I just recently signed up for a membership at Film Forum. I saw Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cContempt,\u201d a new print. There was a new print of \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d So I\u2019m all in on the return to the movies. And I don\u2019t think any of those movies are putting money in the pockets of giant corporations that exist as we know them today. So I can feel really good about all of that. Until a Godard Cinematic Universe is launched. Launches, but I mean, I will say, one of the kind of leitmotifs of my summer has been just an absolute joy at the return to kind of communal experiences. We\u2019ve seen real trouble in the world of theater, for example. I\u2019m not talking about movie theaters. I\u2019m talking about acting and actors on stage and things like that. And all of us need to vote with our feet and go and watch the theater, go to the movies, do things like this if we want these things \u2014 Thank you, Lydia. \u2014 to be part of our culture going forward. So I am with you, Michelle. I\u2019ve got my bucket of popcorn, my giant gallon jug of Diet Coke, and Twizzlers. And I\u2019m ready to go. So I guess I\u2019ll see you at the movies. Fantastic. I\u2019ll be wearing my hot pink disco jumpsuit. And on that note, as I clutch my Robert Oppenheimer action figure, that\u2019s our show for the week. Bye, guys. See you next week.

            "title": "<i>Oppenheimer</i> Dazzles With Its Epic Story of a Complicated Patriot",
            "text": "In filmmaking there\u2019s a fine line between elegance and pretension, and Christopher Nolan, a citizen of both nations, criss-crosses the border freely. His dedication to craft is always right there on the screen, even in films you may not like; for better or worse, you can usually feel the thought vibrations that went into his decisions about where to put the camera, or how to move the actors around. He knows his stuff, and he makes sure we know that he knows. His expertise gleams like a family crest, looking great when it\u2019s discreetly stamped on a piece of silver, though you really wouldn\u2019t want it on a beach towel. There may be times in Oppenheimer when you look at the screen and think, Oh brother! as Nolan razzle-dazzles us with impressionistic inset shots of psychotically whirling stars and billowing plumes of what looks like molten lava, all while the lead character expounds in voiceover on the nature of matter, the universe, and other stuff. But either despite its intense craft or because of it, Oppenheimer works. In telling the story of genius theoretical physicist and atomic-bomb architect J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2014played, with an almost otherworldly luminosity, by Cillian Murphy\u2014Nolan blurs the distinction between grandeur and grandiosity. Both his subject and his lead actor can stand up to the outsize scale of his approach, so why shouldn\u2019t he go for broke? So few filmmakers know how to make, or are able to make, pictures this big, about grown-up subjects. Nolan shapes Oppenheimer\u2019s story into something like an epic poem, focusing not just on his most famous achievement, but on everything that happened to him afterward; Nolan is maybe even more interested in Oppenheimer as a complicated, questioning patriot. As you know if you\u2019ve seen even just one Nolan film\u2014it could be Memento, or Interstellar\u2014he likes to scramble the signals in his storytelling. Oppenheimer is a story told in dots and dashes, demanding that you keep up with its shifts in time and space. But even if you know nothing about Oppenheimer\u2019s story, following along is not that hard\u2014Nolan pulls it all together at the end, and from that vantage point, the landscape of where he\u2019s taken us looks pretty grand. We get some background on Oppenheimer\u2019s time as a young student at Cambridge, homesick for America (he was born in New York) and tormented, as he tells us in those voiceovers, by the secrets of an \u201calien universe.\u201d (Here\u2019s where those visions of blasting stars and looping ribbons of light, accompanied by jarring, staticky noises, come in.) An early encounter with one of his heroes, Danish physicist Niels Bohr (a half-jaunty, half-regal Kenneth Branagh), recalibrates his thinking. He goes to museums, stares at paintings by Braque and Picasso, and something clicks. The music of the universe begins to make more sense. Oppenheimer begins to think and feel more furiously. There\u2019s some writing on a chalkboard\u2014in scientist movies, there always is\u2014but Nolan uses the conceit sparingly and with some delicacy. He knows, as we do, that the scritch of chalk is a lot more romantic than the squeak of a Dry Erase marker. Nolan toggles between the distant past and the less-distant past, shifting between black-and-white film stock to muted color as he focuses on three central episodes in Oppenheimer\u2019s story. (The movie\u2019s source is Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\u2019s 2006 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.) One of these is the 1954 hearing that ultimately led to the revocation of Oppenheimer\u2019s security clearance, ending his career in government and eroding his status as an academic. Jason Clarke\u2019s Roger Robb oversees the proceedings, wearing a carved-stone face that\u2019s decided \u201cguilty\u201d long before he\u2019s even heard any of Oppenheimer\u2019s own testimony, or that of his witnesses. The problem was that after Oppenheimer had pulled off the achievement, both extraordinary and tragic, of developing the bomb that would end World War II, his government, which no longer really needed him, decided it was time to question his loyalty\u2014though the FBI had already been dogging him for years, collecting possible evidence against him. After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer had also expressed moral qualms about the horrors that he\u2019d helped unleash upon the world, and worried about the misuse of nuclear weapons in the future. Nolan balances that 1954 security hearing with another set of hearings before the Senate, convened to confirm\u2014or not, as it turned out\u2014Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to the position of Secretary of Commerce under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Downey\u2019s performance, equal parts subtly scented aftershave and snake oil, is a double-dealing marvel. By now, you may have figured that there a lot of men swirling around Oppenheimer, and we haven\u2019t even gotten to the sections of the movie set in Los Alamos, where Oppenheimer led a team of scientists in the top-secret activities of the Manhattan Project. (They\u2019re played by actors including, but not limited to, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, and Josh Harnett, plus the sole woman, Olivia Thirlby.) When they test their super-duper bomb in the desert, they put on little goggles and avert their eyes during the blast\u2014their self-protective measures are both comical and horrifying. There\u2019s a lot going on in Oppenheimer, and it can leave your brain a little scrambled. But Nolan never loses sight of Oppenheimer the man. We get a sense of Oppenheimer\u2019s early adjacency to the Communist Party (though he never officially joined), another convenient strike against him during that 1954 hearing. There\u2019s also a grievous and, for Oppenheimer, heartbreaking affair with a 1930s cool-girl party member, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh)\u2014the love scenes between the two involve some tastefully lit but not-unaffecting nudity, as well as the reading of Sanskrit. (Always interesting to imagine how great scientists do it.) Nolan is working with so many moving parts here that it would be logical to wonder: does Murphy, his star, even get enough screen time? But Nolan ensures that the movie belongs to him. It\u2019s a wonderful performance, somber without being deadening, and ultimately haunting. What\u2019s it like to be married to a hot genius? (One of the accusations often flung at Oppenheimer was that he was a \u201cwomanizer,\u201d though that word has differing meanings depending on who\u2019s applying them, and how.) Emily Blunt gives us a sense of that in her portrayal of Oppenheimer\u2019s wife, Kitty, also the mother of his two children. There\u2019s no single scene that brings this complex and not particularly blissful marriage to life; it\u2019s only late in the film, when Oppenheimer asserts that these two have \u201cwalked through fire\u201d together, that you get a sense of the ironclad bond between them. Murphy doesn\u2019t play Oppenheimer as the distracted-genius husband; it\u2019s more that he accepts that his life must unfold on numerous shifting planes, each distinct from but affecting the others. You can\u2019t apply quantum mechanics to human behavior. Most important of all, Nolan doesn\u2019t disguise or downplay his sympathy for Oppenheimer the man and the scientist. In that sense, his movie is bracingly honest. He also doesn\u2019t try to oversimplify Oppenheimer\u2019s crises of conscience\u2014they were anything but simple, as Nolan and Murphy show in several scenes underscoring the fact that World War II had to end sooner rather than later, to save the lives of both American and Japanese troops\u2014the casualties on both sides were mounting astronomically day by day and week by week. Yet how could anyone involved in the creation of that bomb not question his or her role after the fact, especially with the benefit of hindsight? Murphy, like Oppenheimer, has a frame that looks to be built from matchsticks, almost too fragile-seeming to support that big brain on top. And his skin has a papery, translucent quality; there are moments when you feel you can almost see his nerve endings quivering beneath. That\u2019s acting for the big screen. And it\u2019s what a great actor can do when a filmmaker hands him a very big story, played out on a canvas designed for great leaps of imagination. Contact us at letters@time.com.",

            "title": "Oppenheimer review \u2013 Nolan\u2019s atom bomb epic is flawed but extraordinary",
            "text": "The wartime Soviet intelligence services had a codename for the Manhattan Project, the US\u2019s plan to build an atom bomb: Enormoz. Christopher Nolan\u2019s new film about it is absolutely Enormoz, maybe his biggest so far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project\u2019s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction. The main event is that terrifying first demonstration: the Trinity nuclear test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, when Oppenheimer is said to have silently pondered (and later intoned on TV) Vishnu\u2019s lines from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: \u201cNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds \u2026\u201d This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan. He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt \u2013 although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic 1945 firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer\u2019s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists. Later in the 50s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US\u2019s nuclear mastery. Cillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process. Matt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Richard Groves, Oppenheimer\u2019s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated. Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn\u2019t quite to get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew. There is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer\u2019s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge. He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D\u2019Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn\u2019t notice and didn\u2019t eat. Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam\u2019s foolish innocence. And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to \u2026 killing someone. The purest payload of fear is delivered in a scene that Nolan handles with forthright gusto. After the successful detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, Murphy shows us Oppenheimer in shock, but also realising he has to address an audience of cheering colleagues and subordinates. He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese \u201cdidn\u2019t like it\u201d, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror. Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance. Perhaps the film\u2019s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has \u201cblood on his hands\u201d. Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb? No, they want to know who dropped it. It\u2019s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and beside the larger historical point. In the end, Nolan shows us how the US\u2019s governing class couldn\u2019t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn\u2019t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual.

            "title": "The Gita, atomic bomb and fear of communism: A moral conundrum from Oppenheimer",
            "text": "\u201cIn battle, in the forest, at the precipice in the mountains/On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows/ In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame/The good deeds a man has done before defend him.\u201d J Robert Oppenheimer recited these lines from the Bhagavad Gita to a friend on the eve of testing the atom bomb and forever altering the fate of our species. What is more commonly known is that, as he witnessed that first mushroom cloud, the following lines from the Gita burst forth from Oppenheimer - \u201cNow I am become death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d. Can our good deeds compensate for our wrongdoing? This is a perennially difficult question. In Oppenheimer\u2019s life, this question took a monstrous form. For what was intended as a good deed inflicted ghastly suffering and created the risk of annihilation on a global scale. This is the crux of why Oppenheimer will stand out in history as a tragic figure. But for the moment it is his transition from American war hero to suspected communist that is likely to dominate the public imagination. The plot of the recently released biopic, \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019, pivots on intrigues during the McCarthy era which undermined the \u2018Father of the Atom Bomb\u2019 and led to him being stripped of his security clearance. Perhaps, filmmaking on an epic scale demands a nemesis versus hero dynamic. In Christopher Nolan\u2019s film, the villain is narrowed down to one person - Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. It is indeed essential to remind every generation about the excesses of the McCarthy era. It is even more important to recognise the pervasive and lingering malice that corrodes any society in which fear of some 'other' is systematically spread. But this tragic phase of Oppenheimer\u2019s life pales in comparison to the everlasting significance of the moral dilemma which led him to quote that verse from the Gita about good deeds defending a man. Oppenheimer, or \u2018Oppie\u2019 as his friends called him, discovered the Gita early in his life when he learnt Sanskrit. So, when he was chosen to head the bomb project, Oppenheimer was already acutely aware of Arjun\u2019s anguish on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The historian James A Hijiya has written that from the very beginning of the work at the Los Alamos lab, Oppenheimer could look beyond the current war and he was dispirited by the prospect of continued development of nuclear weapons after the war. \u201cIn this time of uncertainty Oppenheimer revisited one of his favorite books, the Bhagavad-Gita, and from it drew encouragement that steadied him in his work\u201d wrote Hijiya. Oppenheimer\u2019s \"good deed\" was to do his duty as a scientist and ensure that the Nazis did not beat the Allies in the race to split the atom. It was unthinkable that Hitler\u2019s expansionist fascist regime should get the advantage of a weapon of mass destruction. The Los Alamos lab was in the final stages of making the atom bomb when the Allies marched into Berlin and defeated the Nazis. Many of the scientists working on the project felt that the bomb was no longer required. When they discovered that the American government was planning to use the bomb against the Japanese some scientists, led by Leo Szilard, appealed to the US government not to do so. It has been argued that Oppenheimer did not sufficiently lend the force of his position to this dissenting voice. Like many scientists at Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was convinced that because the bomb was so terrible it would not be used again, after being dropped on Hiroshima. The American decision to drop a second bomb on Nagasaki shook him. On August 9th, 1945, the day the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, an FBI informant reported that Oppenheimer was a nervous wreck. Later, Oppenheimer spoke about having blood on his hands. President Harry Truman firmly told Oppenheimer that he had nothing to do with the dropping of the bombs. It was a Presidential decision. Oppenheimer was clear that the atom bomb is an aggressor\u2019s weapon, that the elements of surprise and terror are intrinsic to it. He could also see that in military terms, nuclear weapons are an exercise in futility. Within days of the Nagasaki bombing, as head of a scientific panel, he wrote to Secretary of War Henry Stimson: \u201cWe are not only unable to outline a program that would assure to this nation for the next decade's hegemony in the field of atomic weapons; we are equally unable to insure that such hegemony, if achieved, could protect us from the most terrible destruction. \u2026We believe that the safety of this nation \u2013 as opposed to its ability to inflict damage on an enemy power \u2013 cannot lie wholly or even primarily in its scientific or technical prowess. It can be based only on making future wars impossible.\u201d The absurdity to which nuclear weapons have reduced humans is indeed stark. In the book \u2018American Prometheus\u2019 his biographers quote Oppenheimer as asking: \u201cWhat are we to make of a civilization which has always regarded ethics as an essential part of human life [but] which has not been able to talk about the prospect of killing almost everybody except in prudential and game-theoretical terms?\u201d Oppenheimer remains important primarily as a symbol of those who voice this disquiet and dare to insist that human beings can make future wars impossible. How well or how poorly Oppenheimer processed both this disquiet and this hope \u2013 in his private and public life \u2013 is now only of academic interest. What matters is for every generation to reaffirm the importance of having the moral dilemma at all. It takes an ethical base for the individual to have the awareness that there is a moral dilemma and then courage to face it, to attempt to address it. This truism is applicable in all areas of life \u2013 not just science and technology. To what extent do people in decision making positions feel compelled to \u2018just get the job done\u2019 and not ask distracting moral questions? This approach got the bomb built \u2018on time\u2019 and it also enabled the death camps in Nazi Germany to operate \u2018smoothly\u2019. Yes, it matters that the bomb builders felt they were defending freedom and those running the concentration camps were driven by delusions of racial superiority. But this distinction was utterly irrelevant for the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As Oppenheimer found at great cost to himself \u2013 the good we actually do may not make up for the destruction wrought by our good intentions.

            "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s long-awaited new blockbuster Oppenheimer is out in cinemas this week. The film starring Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the titular role promises to tell the story of American scientist J Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb. It is partially based on the Pulitzer-Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer written by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin over a period of 25 years. \u201cCelebrated in 1945 as the \u2018father of the atomic bomb,\u2019 nine years later he would become the chief celebrity victim of the McCarthyite maelstrom,\u201d Bird wrote in a recent opinion piece for The New York Times. Oppenheimer is the first film to properly tackle the scientist and his legacy, which was marred by a controversial 1954 hearing that resulted in his security clearance being revoked. Oppenheimer was born into an affluent German-Jewish family in New York City. His family\u2019s art collection included original works by Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. It became apparent at an early age that Oppenheimer\u2019s academic ability outstripped those of his peers and he entered Harvard University aged 18 where he graduated after just three years summa cum laude (with highest praise). However, he struggled with his mental health. During his time at college, he expressed suicidal thoughts and, while pursuing a graduate degree at Cambridge University, deliberately left an apple, poisoned with laboratory chemicals, on his tutor\u2019s desk. By the outbreak of World War II, though, Oppenheimer had transformed himself into a respected professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and had already made numerous, significant contributions to science. During his time at Berkeley, he fell in love with Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh in Oppenheimer), the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at Stanford University School of Medicine. She was a member of the Communist Party, which later became an issue in his security clearance hearings. It\u2019s been confirmed Murphy and Pugh have scenes of \u201cprolonged nudity\u201d together \u2013 a first in Nolan\u2019s filmography. They broke up in 1939 and, a year later, he married Katherine (\u201dKitty\u201d) Puening with whom he had two children. During their marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his relationship with Tatlock and the two had an affair. She later committed suicide in 1944. In 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D Roosevelt approved a programme to develop an atomic bomb. A year later, Oppenheimer was recruited by the National Defense Research Committee to research the building of an atomic bomb. That September, General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film) took over as head of the Manhattan Project (named after its inaugural offices in lower Manhattan) and selected Oppenheimer to head the project\u2019s secret weapons laboratory. For three years, Oppenheimer and a huge team of scientists worked towards the creation of an atomic bomb out of a military laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Their work culminated in the first nuclear detonation in history, known as the Trinity test, on 16 July 1945. In an interview conducted years later, Oppenheimer claimed that a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, had come into his mind during the detonation: \u201cNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\u201d A month later two of the bombs developed by the Manhattan Project were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing approximately 200,000 people, the majority of whom were civilians. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan\u2019s surrender. After the project\u2019s success, Oppenheimer continued to act as a nuclear weapons consultant for the US government; however, he warned against their devastating capabilities. In a 1953, speech he likened the nuclear capabilities of the United States and the Soviet Union to \u201ctwo scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life\u201d. In December of that year, during the Second Red Scare in the US, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr in Nolan\u2019s film) told Oppenheimer that his top-secret security clearance had been revoked and insisted on his resignation. However, the scientist refused and insisted on defending himself at a highly-publicised security hearing, which he lost amid public humiliation. Numerous sources have suggested that Oppenheimer never recovered from the incident. The New York Times wrote in his obituary: \u201cThis bafflingly complex man nonetheless never fully succeeded in dispelling doubts about his conduct.\u201d Attempts were later made to repair Oppenheimer\u2019s image \u2013 in 1963, President Lyndon B Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award, the AEC\u2019s highest honour. A chainsmoker, Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in his home in Princeton in February 1967. In his piece for The NYT, Bird wrote: \u201cIt is my hope that Christopher Nolan\u2019s stunning new film on Oppenheimer\u2019s complicated legacy will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction, but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals.\u201d",

            "text": "The blockbuster movie, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, had its UK premiere in Odeon Luxe, Leicester Square in London last week. The Hollywood actors' strike, recently announced by SAG-AFTRA (The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists), saw the stars of the Oppenheimer movie walk out on the UK premiere. All the big names attended the red carpet but when audience members were seated in the cinema ready for the screening of the movie, Nolan said the actors had left \"to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike\". Oppenheimer will be out in cinemas across the UK from Friday, July 21. What is Oppenheimer about? Oppenheimer is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. According to IDMb Oppenheimer tells the true story of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Describing the film, PA Media said: \"Beautifully depicted relationships contrast with a dark narrative in this biographical drama, based on the true story that forever altered our world.\" 78 years ago today, they did something that forever changed the world.

            "text": "The blockbuster movie, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, had its UK premiere in Odeon Luxe, Leicester Square in London last week. The Hollywood actors' strike, recently announced by SAG-AFTRA (The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists), saw the stars of the Oppenheimer movie walk out on the UK premiere. All the big names attended the red carpet but when audience members were seated in the cinema ready for the screening of the movie, Nolan said the actors had left \"to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike\". Oppenheimer will be out in cinemas across the UK from Friday, July 21. What is Oppenheimer about? Oppenheimer is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. According to IDMb Oppenheimer tells the true story of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Describing the film, PA Media said: \"Beautifully depicted relationships contrast with a dark narrative in this biographical drama, based on the true story that forever altered our world.\" 78 years ago today, they did something that forever changed the world.

            "text": "Barbie fans have flocked to Leicester Square to watch the predicted blockbuster hit battle in the box office with Oppenheimer \u2013 as as some hardcore cinephiles sat through a five hour double billing. Beaming Barbie enthusiasts gathered up and down the UK today lauding the \u2018amazing\u2019 film and professing it had exceeded \u2018huge hype\u2019 that rapidly built up over the past few weeks, with one saying she shed a tear over the film. Sayna, 24, of London, told MailOnline after watching the film: \u2018There were some moments that you could really connect with. At one point I did shed a tear. \u2018But it was also a really funny film too. A good comedy. Ken\u2019s character provided that entertainment value.\u2019 Meanwhile, a Barbie super fan with a massive collection of over 300 Barbie dolls said: \u2018Barbie is just so iconic isn\u2019t she. \u2018She means so much to so many women. It gets seen as a childish thing but I don\u2019t think we ever grow out of it\u2019, Philippa, 45, from the Midlands, said. \u2018It seems to have caught everyone by surprise. It\u2019s phenomenal.\u2019 Others who have worshipped the iconic doll since childhood have dubbed it \u2018fun\u2019 while one, who admitted to being a Bratz girl growing up, admitted the Greta Gerwig epic has changed her mind. Fin, 26, from Edinburgh, who admitted he had loved Barbie since being handed down a Barbie bike at the age of five, said: \u2018I\u2019m really looking forward to it. There\u2019s so much hype around the film. It\u2019ll be a fun one.\u2019 And Harriet, 24, from Sheffield, is now a firm Barbie fan, saying: \u2018There\u2019s just so much hype and it looks amazing\u2019. Over the weekend thousands more moviegoers dressed head-to-toe in pink garments from feather boas to cowboy hats, are expected to flock to see Greta Gerwig\u2019s film that has already been rated an impressive 89 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. And the hotly-anticipated movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is set to exceed its competitor: early estimates at the US box office suggesting Barbie is set to earn more than \u00a385m this weekend alone, while Christopher Nolan\u2019s production will draw around \u00a323m. Speaking after seeing the film, Kristele Joyeux, 26, said: \u2018I think it exceeded the hype, they were very clever with how they marketed it, making it look fun but the movie was much deeper \u2013 it\u2019s the cultural moment of the decade.\u2019 Meanwhile, Luke Denton, 23, added: \u2018It felt like a generational film. I think I will be watching it again and again for years.\u2019 And Kendra Kelly, 19, said: \u2018It was so good, the hype was real. My favourite bit was the rant the mother goes on. It was everything I have ever wanted to say to a man as a woman. It was really good to see how society norms were challenged.\u2019 Hani Azeemah, 22, added: \u2018As a young adult who\u2019s really confused about the uncertainty of the future, it made me feel safe and validated. I thought it would be fake but it was actually very real and raw.\u2019 Chelsey Adusei, 16, whose favourite Barbie was President Barbie, said: \u2018It\u2019s really good, different to what I was expecting because it emphasises modern society views today. It was a ten out of ten I really did enjoy it.\u2019 Amongst the buzzing fans in the capital\u2019s cultural hub was one of the film\u2019s stars \u2013 Callum Bell, 23, who plays a Ken doll. He had taken his family to view the new film at Leicester Square and soak up the fanfare the movie had created. He told MailOnline: \u2018It was so amazing, it\u2019s surreal to be watching it. The cast were all so lovely, Greta was amazing to work with, she\u2019s so hands on. \u2018It was one of my first jobs as an actor, so it\u2019s hard to even think about what it has become \u2013 it\u2019s now massive.\u2019 Gerwig\u2019s satire will go head-to-head in the global box office against Nolan\u2019s intense drama Oppenheimer, which is about the scientist who first created the atomic bomb. The two major titles were released simultaneously today with thousands of fans deciding to buy tickets for both shows leading to a spawning phenomenon known as Barbenheimer. Barbie mania has since taken over the UK, with pink wine sales rocketing across the country, according to new figures. Aldi said it had seen a record 35 per cent spike in sales of its Rioja Rose in the week leading up to the movie launch. Miranda Saul, 24, headed to Leicester Square with her pals Spiky Saul, 22, and Tobias Green, 25, decked out in pink clothing. She told MailOnline: \u2018Dressing up is not something I have ever done before but this is my Marvel. \u2018I got up at 7am and went to Oppenheimer dressed in pink. It\u2019s just fun.\u2019 Marlia Van\u2019t Sant, 22, who had been to see Barbie with a gaggle of friends said \u2018It was better than I thought it was going to be, deeper than I thought\u2019, while Anerka Raj, 23, said she was a \u2018whole new person\u2019 after watching it. Amongst the first through the doors to see Robbie and Gosling\u2019s film were Charlie Wootton, 24, Jordan Mander, 28, Rob Corbishley, 24, who donned pink skirts, pink cowboy hats and even pink socks. The trio who had travelled down from Kettering in Northampton this morning, enjoyed a few beers on their train down, decided to start with off with Barbie \u2018for starter\u2019 followed by Oppenheimer \u2018for main\u2019 and beers \u2018for dessert\u2019. Charlie who wore a black tutu and a pink cowboy hat said: \u2018It\u2019s going to be an all dayer, Barbie for starter, Oppenheimer for main, beers for dinner.\u2019 His friend Jordan who wore a limited edition pink Barbie tee added: \u2018As soon as we saw the date in the calendar for Oppenheimer we were like yes let\u2019s do it, but we didn\u2019t think Barbie would be this big and it\u2019s actually become the main event\u2019. Londoner Karol Olszewski, 23, dressed up in pink trousers and a pink and white Mean Girls top as he went to the first showing. He told MailOnline: said: \u2018I\u2019m very excited, the Barbie film has been my whole personality for the past few months. It\u2019s a cultural experience, the theatres are filled out. I think Barbie is playing up to the narrative of the male gaze so I wanted to wear a lot of pink.\u2019 Barbie fanatic Emily, 18, added: \u2018I really like the Barbieheimer hype. Rather than pitting the two against each other, they are all coming together and embracing it \u2013 both casts as well. Hopefully I\u2019ll catch Oppenheimer on Sunday.\u2019 Film maker Mitch Corrigan, 22, who left his home in Somerset just after midnight today to watch the serious Oppenheimer followed by some light relief with Barbie. His verdict was that while Nolan\u2019s film was definitely worth the early start, he was not as convinced about Gerwig\u2019s. He told MailOnline ahead of the showing: \u2018I\u2019m inspired to see Barbie after Oppenheimer, it finished about half an hour ago. \u2018I\u2019m not confident it\u2019s going to be better but it might be what I need right now. I\u2019m in London see a little life but thought I\u2019d come and see a few films, I\u2019m hoping to catch Mission Impossible and another maybe.\u2019 Giving his verdict briefly as he scurried on to see Mission Impossible, Mitch concluded that \u2018Oppenheimer was worth the journey, but maybe Barbie wasn\u2019t.\u2019 Others, however, branded the film as \u2018so good\u2019 and \u2018worth the hype and even more\u2019. Others online gushed about the movie. One on Twitter said: \u2018Barbie movie was a thousand percent worth the hype. I laughed, I cried, I never knew what to expect. So damn good. Oscar for all of them and Ryan Gosling should get a Grammy too.\u2019 Another added \u2018Loved loved loved the Barbie movie definitely worth the hype\u2019 while a third said \u2018the barbie movie is actually so good like so worth the hype its getting\u2019. Aaliyah Valentine, 17, is watching Barbie as a priority before catching Oppenheimer later on today. She said: \u2018I\u2019ve been really looking forward since I heard about the Barbie film, I was really exited because when I was younger I used to play with Barbie\u2019s so it\u2019s like I grew up with her. \u2018I really like Margot Robbie, I\u2019ve seen her in suicide squad and her other films so I like her as an actress.\u2019 Simon Humphrey, 42, who works in a bookshop and is on holiday in London said ahead of the show: \u2018I watch a lot of films and I have never seen a film be so sold out on so many screenings. I looked at the Vue, Cineworld, one on Tottenham Court Road just to get a good viewing time.\u2019 Reviewing the film, Simon said: \u2018Glad to have seen it and think it\u2019s something I enjoyed generally, but not quite as much as I thought I would.\u2019 Emily, 18, said: \u2018I have always loved Barbie, grew up playing with them and Margot Robbie is just Barbie to me. The sound track -of what I\u2019ve heard \u2013 is really good. \u2018I really like the Barbieheimer hype. Rather than pitting the two against eachother, they are all coming together and embracing it \u2013 both casts as well. Hopefully I\u2019ll catch Oppenheimer on Sunday.\u2019 For many Barbie fans, the film brings about feelings of nostalgia, causing them to reminisce of how their childhoods were spent playing with the much-loved dolls. \u2018Every Christmas and birthday there was a Barbie and one year I was really fortunate, my dad got me the Barbie dream house,\u2019 Emily added. Holiday goer 15-year-old Hazel from Texas, said: \u2018I was really stressed when I found out I wasn\u2019t going to be in the US when Barbie came out, but I\u2019m here. \u2018I love Margot Robbie and I\u2019m really excited about Dua Lipa, with her song in it \u2013 I loved it when she wore the mermaid wig. \u2018I had a Barbie Rapunzel when I was younger, once I tried to wash her hair \u2013 don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Barbie fans have marked the occasion by grabbing their best pink gear as they head to the cinemas. Across the country a sea of pink-clad Barbie fans lined up with their popcorn as they walked into theatres. Some hoping to see both films wore custom clothing with \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 placed all over it. Even those heading to their workplaces this morning wore a touch of pink to mark the cultural moment \u2013 with one store manager at Sauve Owl clothing in Somerset wearing a pink suit. Both films are set to rake in millions after spending $100m each on production costs. So far the Odeon has reported that more than 300 screenings have sold out for both films and predicts it will sell a million tickets in the next week alone. Cineworld expects to enjoy its biggest weekend in terms of ticket sales for years, having already sold 200,000 in advance. The chain has branded it the biggest opening since the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame in 2019, which brought in \u00a3276m over its first weekend alone. In the hours after the films were screened, Rotten Tomato gave Oppenheimer a 93 per cent score while Barbie was given 89 per cent. Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie sees Margot Robbie, 33, leading the cast as the eponymous Barbie doll alongside her boyfriend Ken, played by Ryan Gosling, 42. The cast is a who\u2019s who of Hollywood powerhouses, with Will Ferrell playing the CEO of Mattel, and Helen Mirren the narrator. It follows Barbie who leaves her \u2018perfect\u2019 life as a doll and sets out to explore the complexities of being a woman in the real world. Meanwhile Oppenheimer features an all-star cast and is led by Cillian Murphy, who plays the theoretical physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. The movie also boasts a stellar cast including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon. The Barbenheimer phenomenon means that the films \u2013 which are vastly different from one another \u2013 will not be competing but rather helping one another gain more ticket sales. David A Gross, founder of Franchise Entertainment Research, added: \u2018The two films are going to help each other, not compete with each other, by creating the kind of excitement we\u2019re seeing for moviegoing in general.\u2019 It comes as moviegoers have taken to social media today to share their excitement of seeing both films on the same day. Tens of thousands are expected to take part in the movie marathon in what will provide a much needed boost to the industry \u2013 which has suffered a \u00a35billion loss in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Over the past few weeks, there has been an ongoing debate on social media as to which film should be viewed first \u2013 with many sharing their schedules for the hotly anticipated day online. Sander Wagner, a 40-year-old researcher from Oxford University, said Barbie would be a \u2018dessert\u2019 after watching the more intense Oppenheimer. He said: \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019s probably the more heavy movie that, from everything I\u2019ve heard, takes a bit of digesting. \u2018I think Barbie is a fun movie to watch after a drink and it works much more like a palate cleanser or dessert.\u2019 Mr Wagner and his girlfriend will watch Oppenheimer with friends in Oxford. \u2018After that, we\u2019ll have probably one or two drinks and dinner at a bar and then we\u2019ll head back to the movie theatre and watch the 9pm Barbie performance,\u2019 he said. Fellow moviegoer Matt Durrant, a 29-year-old HR manager from south-east London, shared the view that the Barbie film should be watched second. \u2018I would prefer to finish off with a lighthearted thing, because the idea is that I think we\u2019re going to go to the pub,\u2019 he said. Outlining his Barbenheimer plans, he said: \u2018I work for one of those very lucky companies where we get Friday afternoons off in the summer so the idea is that a group of workmates are going to go to the cinema. \u2018We\u2019re trying to do it back to back. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really figured out but we hope with the timings of the ads and everything that it\u2019ll work out. \u2018I think it\u2019s quite funny how they\u2019re both out at the same time and I think that\u2019s kind of part of the appeal for why we\u2019re going to see them at the same time. \u2018It\u2019s got a lot of hype and I think lots of people just haven\u2019t been back to the cinema since the pandemic. \u2018It\u2019s good to support the arts but also, the only thing I\u2019ve seen since the pandemic in the cinema was the Bond film so it feels a bit like a homecoming for the cinema.\u2019",

            "title": "Did Oppenheimer\u2019s apple-poisoning incident really happen? It\u2019s complicated",
            "text": "Much of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour biopic about the theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, is rooted in verifiable fact. The film tracks the life of Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), from his early political activity through to the invention of the atomic bomb, and then the attacks on his reputation after the Second World War. While much of the film draws from historical record, Oppenheimer begins, controversially, with a sequence in which Oppenheimer injects cyanide into the apple of Patrick Blackett, a Cambridge University tutor he dislikes. In the film, Oppenheimer eventually changes his mind and is able to prevent the apple from being eaten. However, it is unclear whether this incident occurred in real-life at all. Oppenheimer\u2019s real-life grandson Charles Oppenheimer complained about the scene\u2019s inclusion to Time magazine, describing it as \u201chistorical revision\u201d. The incident was described in the book that inspired Nolan\u2019s film \u2013 American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin. American Prometheus claimed that Oppenheimer had \u201cpoisoned an apple with chemicals from the laboratory and left it on Blackett\u2019s desk\u201d after becoming \u201cconsumed by his feelings of inadequacy and intense jealousy\u201d. According to the book, Oppenheimer was allowed to stay on at Cambridge thanks to the intervention of his influential parents, though had to undergo psychiatric treatment. American Prometheus also claims that Oppenheimer himself would describe the incident later in life, though it is unclear whether aspects of the poisoning may have been exaggerated. The nature of the poison used is also contested, with the book suggesting that a non-lethal chemical may have been used instead of cyanide. Ray Monk\u2019s biography of Oppenheimer, A Life Inside the Center, also includes a description of the alleged attempted poisoning. \u201cIn what looks like an attempt to murder his tutor, or at the very least to make him seriously ill, Oppenheimer left on Blackett\u2019s desk an apple poisoned with toxic chemicals,\u201d Monk wrote. However, the biography also notes that Oppenheimer relayed the story \u201cmany times in many different versions\u201d to friends over the course of his life, casting doubt over the specifics of the case. Speaking to Time, Charles Oppenheimer did not point the finger towards Nolan, but instead the source material. \u201cThe part I like the least is this poison apple reference, which was a problem in American Prometheus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read American Prometheus carefully enough, the authors say, \u2018We don\u2019t really know if it happened.\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s no record of him trying to kill somebody. That\u2019s a really serious accusation and it\u2019s historical revision. There\u2019s not a single enemy or friend of Robert Oppenheimer who heard that during his life and considered it to be true.\u201d Oppenheimer is out in cinemas now.",

            "text": "Releasing on the same day as Greta Gerwig\u2018s Barbie, Christopher Nolan\u2018s new thriller, Oppenheimer, is sure to be a major contrast to its box office competition. Luckily, we have you covered on all the ways you can watch this new flick! Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\u2019s book, American Prometheus, Oppenheimer is a biological thriller about J. Robert Oppenheimer \u2014 the physicist who helped create the world\u2019s first nuclear weapons. Aside from Cillian Murphy starring as the titular character, the movie also features a slew of big names such as Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh. So where can you watch Oppenheimer? Is it on Netflix? What about Max? Here\u2019s everything we know about the upcoming movie: WHERE TO WATCH OPPENHEIMER: As of now, the only way to watch Oppenheimer is to head out to a movie theater when it releases on Friday, July 21. You can find a local showing on Fandango. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just have to wait for it to become available to rent or purchase on digital platforms like Amazon, Vudu, YouTube and Apple or become available to stream on Peacock. Read on for more information. WHEN WILL OPPENHEIMER BE ON DIGITAL? WILL OPPENHEIMER BE ON PRIME VIDEO? Unfortunately, there is no digital release date for Oppenheimer \u2014 yet. Asteroid City, another recent Universal Pictures film, came to digital platforms like Amazon Prime Video about three weeks after its theatrical release. If Oppenheimer follows the same pattern, you might be able to rent or purchase it by mid-August 2023. But if Nolan\u2019s film sticks to the 45-day standard that most movies follow, it might not be available on digital until early September 2023. WHEN WILL OPPENHEIMER BE ON PEACOCK? While a Peacock release date for Oppenheimer has not yet been announced, we can make an estimate based on another recent film distributed by Universal Pictures. Cocaine Bear was released in theaters on Feb. 24 before joining the streaming platform on April 14 \u2014 a little over 45 days after its debut. If Oppenheimer follows the same trajectory, it should come to Peacock by early September 2023. However, other movies like Nope have taken a little longer to reach the streamer (more than 100 days, to be exact) so it\u2019s best to take this estimate with a grain of salt. WILL OPPENHEIMER BE ON MAX? No, Oppenheimer will not be on Max since it\u2019s not a Warner Bros. movie. The platform \u2014 previously known as HBO Max \u2014 also no longer does direct-to-streaming releases. Instead, they\u2019ve implemented a 45-day window between the theatrical release and the Max release. WILL OPPENHEIMER BE ON NETFLIX? No, Oppenheimer will not be on Netflix \u2014 at least not any time soon. In the meantime, you\u2019ll just have to head out to a movie theater or wait for it to become available to stream on Peacock.",

            "text": "Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker with a mind for engineering. He\u2019s obsessed with time, constructing stories that move simultaneously at different speeds like the hour, minute, and second hands of a wristwatch. While his films often deal with heavy themes and complex protagonists, it\u2019s usually more interesting to talk about the shape of Nolan\u2019s stories than about their content. The Dark Knight and Inception are thrilling and technically innovative, but they\u2019re not quite as smart as they appear to be on the surface. His latest feature, which stars longtime collaborator Cillian Murphy as the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project, employs all of his usual technical and structural tricks in the service of a story that is truly as complex as it is complicated. Simultaneously a biography, a mystery, a polemic, and a dense character study, Oppenheimer feels like the film Christopher Nolan has been preparing to make his entire career, and it may very well be his best work. Like The Prestige, Dunkirk, and Memento, the story of Oppenheimer is conveyed via multiple intersecting temporalities. Nolan is kind enough to label the film\u2019s two narrative spines for us: \u201cFission,\u201d a recollection of J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s life and career based on his testimony to a security clearance council in 1954, and \u201cFusion,\u201d a counterpoint from the perspective of Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) during his confirmation hearings to become Secretary of Commerce in 1959. Despite not always moving in a linear fashion, the interwoven accounts remain both logically and emotionally coherent, painting a portrait of a controversial figure that is both sympathetic and damning. The two framing devices are not the only courtroom dramas at hand here. The film itself is a trial, and just like the interrogations of Oppenheimer and Strauss, there is no real burden of proof. Nolan is playing both the prosecution and the defense. The trial isn\u2019t fair, he knows it, and he wants you to know. At its heart, Oppenheimer is about the terrifying transformation of theory into practice. The story introduces us to Robert as a young and ambitious scholar in the very new field of quantum physics, but like Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) before him, he is a theorist, not an engineer. How his research is applied is not his concern, or so he asserts until the consequences of his work become impossible for any sane man to ignore. This theme seeps into other parts of his story, such as the juxtaposition of his communist sympathies against his practical political agnosticism, or the reverberations of his irresponsible romantic affairs. How many degrees must exist between cause and effect, between ideation and execution, to assuage him of his guilt? Aside from being heady and profound, Oppenheimer is also much more fun than you might expect. Nolan keeps this massive monster moving at a steady, bracing pace. Though the relentless momentum and wall-to-wall musical score can have a flattening effect, granting practically every scene equal gravity, it also never allows your attention to waver. At no point in Oppenheimer\u2019s three-hour runtime does it feel safe to run to the bathroom. Urgent plot developments and character context unfold constantly, giving this epic biopic the grip of a murder mystery or a political thriller. And for a historical biopic about one of the most terrible events in recorded history, Oppenheimer is surprisingly funny. The playful, Sorkinesque banter between Cillian Murphy\u2019s Oppenheimer and Matt Damon\u2019s prickly General Leslie Groves is every bit as charming as the timeline-spanning bromance of John David Washington and Robert Pattinson in Tenet. Emily Blunt slays as Robert\u2019s iron-willed wife Kitty, a character whose minimal role in the film\u2019s first two hours is merely the windup for an Oscar-worthy uppercut. Nolan has assembled a huge cast of character actors consisting of about half of Hollywood\u2019s white dudes, but it\u2019s a particular showcase for performers with creepy eyes and punchable faces. Oppenheimer offers a murder\u2019s row of actors you would cast as serial killers \u2014 Dane DeHaan, David Dastmalchian, Casey Affleck, Rami Malik, Benny Safdie \u2014 and utilizes each of them perfectly. This helps to raise star Cillian Murphy, who filled the serial-killer space in Nolan\u2019s Batman Begins, to the relative position of Handsome Leading Man. Murphy is haunting and nuanced as Oppenheimer, but of all of the film\u2019s sharp performances, Robert Downey Jr.\u2018s Lewis Strauss stands head and shoulders above. Downey plays Strauss as Oppenheimer\u2019s Burr or Salieri, an insecure political operator whose obsession with the \u201cfather of the atom bomb\u201d contains both sincere reverence and seething resentment. After a decade sealed in that Iron Man suit, Downey finally reasserts himself as a generation-defining talent, the reason we ever gave a shit about Tony Stark in the first place. One might imagine that the atom bomb itself might emerge as the lead of Oppenheimer, particularly as the film\u2019s press tour has emphasized the use of practical, optical effects in its portrayal rather than CGI. Nolan and company\u2019s depictions of nuclear reactions both microscopic and gargantuan are, indeed, awe-inspiring, and even as a critic who finds the trend of filmmakers boasting how little VFX they\u2019ve used to be a snobbish affectation, there\u2019s no denying the value of this creative decision. However, more striking than the images themselves is the fact that they help to underscore the film\u2019s humanity rather than distract from it. In Oppenheimer\u2019s first act, shots of sparks and particles are intercut with Robert\u2019s studies, a visual representation of his brilliance. Its first two hours are all building to the Trinity bomb test, which we witness in all its terrifying power. From this point on, however, we no longer see the destructive power of the atom bomb, because Robert himself refuses to look at it. Instead, we feel it, as if his unwillingness to view the reaction he started in the outside world has caused it to begin inside his body, and ours. There\u2019s an argument to be made that any film about J. Robert Oppenheimer is inherently apologia for America\u2019s bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or at least for the man who made it possible. The absence of a Japanese perspective in the story or any images of the bombings or their aftermath may, too, become the subject of debate in the coming weeks. However, the impossibility of a fair or objective reading is baked into the text of Oppenheimer. The film can either be read as Christopher Nolan defending Robert Oppenheimer, or as Nolan condemning himself for doing so. Is an attempt to understand a guilty person, in itself, an act of forgiveness? Where does the theory end and the practice begin?

            "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s movie Oppenheimer will hit theatres across the world today. The star-studded film chronicles the story of the scientist J Robert Oppenheimer, also known as the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb.\u201d While his accomplishments far outweigh his bizarre life story, which has enough wacko accounts for multiple feature films, some instances from his history will help us understand the conflicted man and his roots a little better. This trinity of stories is just a glimpse of the idiosyncrasies that made the man both a great scientist and a great subject for a motion picture like Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer tried to poison his professor Perhaps there is no better story to begin the anthology of wildness that makes up the genius scientist's life than one that harkens back to his days in college. While most of us might reminisce about bunking class to watch movies during college back in the day, the young Robert did something that is on a completely different scale of outrageous\u2014he tried to poison his professor. Vanity Fair reports that what is part of the movie Oppenheimer did happen\u2014Robert Oppenheimer tried to poison his professor Patrick Blackett, who later went on to win a Nobel Prize, by injecting an apple with chemicals. \u201cRobert did something so stupid that it seemed calculated to prove that his emotional distress was overwhelming him. Consumed by his feelings of inadequacy and intense jealousy, he \u2018poisoned\u2019 an apple with chemicals from the laboratory and left it on Blackett\u2019s desk,\u201d wrote biographers Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin in American Prometheus, the book which Oppenheimer is based on. This happened when Oppenheimer was a student at Cambridge and university officials eventually found out about it. His wealthy and influential parents had to intervene to stop him from being expelled. The role of Patrick Blackett is played by James D\u2019Arcy in the movie. Einstein called him a fool Oppenheimer had some connections to the communist party and this was a bad look for him in the 1950s, a period marked by the political repression and persecution of left-wing individuals in the United States. The physicist was summoned to a security meeting where he had to account for his past behaviour and old associations. Albert Einstein compelled Oppenheimer not to give legitimacy to what was referred to as a kangaroo court by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. Instead, Einstein advised Oppenheimer to quit his post and the country as the former had done in Germany during the rise of the Nazis. Oppenheimer refused Einstein\u2019s advice, which later proved to be a mistake when he was branded a traitor and had his security clearance removed. In 1954, when Oppenheimer had refused the advice, Einstein said, \u201cThere goes a narr (fool in Yiddish)\u201d to his assistant, nodding in the direction of Oppenheimer, according to The Guardian. Scottish actor Tom Conti plays the role of Einstein in the movie Oppenheimer. He may have codenamed the first nuclear test in honour of his former mistress The first detonation of a nuclear weapon in human history happened in a desert in the Jornada del Muerto in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. The test of an implosion-design plutonium nuclear bomb was nicknamed Trinity by J Robert Oppenheimer. Although no one knows exactly why the test was christened Trinity by the scientists, one theory amplified by the New Yorker proposes that it is an allusion to the poetry of John Donne. Oppenheimer was introduced to the poems of Donne by his former mistress, Jean Tatlock, who was a student at the University of California, Berkeley when he was a professor there. Tatlock was found dead in her San Francisco apartment on January 5, 1944, according to Today. \u201cI am disgusted with everything.\u2026To those who loved me and helped me, all love and courage. I wanted to live and to give and I got paralyzed somehow. I tried like hell to understand and couldn\u2019t.\u2026I think I would have been a liability all my life\u2014at least I could take away the burden of a paralyzed soul from a fighting world,\u201d wrote Tatlock in what is believed to be her suicide note. Florence Pugh plays the role of Jean Tatlock in the movie.",

            "title": "What's behind India's fury over Oppenheimer sex scene",
            "text": "A quote from sacred Hindu scripture in the biopic has sparked debate at multiple levels The blockbuster film 'Oppenheimer' by Christopher Nolan, which was released last Friday, triggered a raging controversy in India over an intimate scene in which the protagonist recites a line from the sacred Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. As Indians poured into the movie theaters over the weekend to watch Nolan's latest and much anticipated work, social media was soon boiling with calls to boycott the film. The drama narrates the story of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer - often referred to as the 'father of the atomic bomb' - and explored the creation of the infamous Manhattan Project, which culminated with the US bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945. In the film, Oppenheimer, played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, is shown making love with Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh. In the controversial scene, Pugh stops during intercourse and picks up a copy of the Bhagavad Gita and asks Murphy to read from it. \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\" Oppenheimer's character says. On Monday, Indian Minister for Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Anurag Thakur lashed out at the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), popularly called the censor board, over the 'objectionable' scene and asked for it to be removed. The government has initiated action against officials who are seen as responsible for it. Questions for the censor board Earlier, on Sunday, Uday Mahurkar, a journalist-turned-information commissioner of the Indian government, lashed out at the CBFC for approving the movie. Mahurkar took on the CBFC as the founder of 'Save Culture, Save India Foundation', which he launched in December 2022 with the aim to \"unite India against perverted content makers\" online and on TV. Mahurkar linked escalating instances of sexual assault in the country with the rise in porn addiction. \"One is perplexed as to how the CBFC could approve the movie with this scene,\" Mahurkar wrote on Twitter while sharing a press release from his foundation. He called the scene \"a scathing attack on Hinduism\" and urged the I&B ministry \"to do all that is needed to uphold dignity of the revered holy book of the Hindus, punish those involved and [set] processes in place that such things do not happen in future.\" In June, the foundation hosted an event in which Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk and Chief Minister (CM) of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, honored 'cultural warriors' and released a film \"exposing makers of perverted content that leads to cultural degradation, including rape.\" He said that the digital age is as beneficial as it is dangerous, sounding the alarm about school children being lured to convert to another religion from Hinduism through online gaming activities. 'Oppenheimer' is the first Nolan movie to receive an R rating from the Motion Pictures Association of America, which means it contains adult material and those under 17 require accompanying parent or adult guardian to watch the film. However, India's CBFC gave it a U/A rating, which means moderate adult themes, after Universal - the studio which produced the movie - cut out some shots of the \"intimate scenes.\" The cuts were reportedly made by the studio itself because it did not think the censor board would allow the scenes. As per this certification, the content is not considered strong in nature and can be watched by a child below 12 years of age under parental guidance. Though the censor removed some abusive words from Oppenheimer as well as some shots of the sex scene, while also editing a scene in which Florence Pugh is nude - in the version shown in Indian cinemas, she appears to wear a black dress - it allowed the scene which has caused the uproar. Earlier, Nolan, who is known for never including sex scenes in his movies, defended the intimate scenes, explaining that they were vital to accurately portray the passionate relationship between Oppenheimer and Tatlock. Neither Nolan nor Universal have responded yet to the raging controversy in India. Lost in translation Meanwhile, the interpretation of the quote from the Bhagavad Gita cited during the scene that created the controversy was questioned by renowned Indian author Devdutt Pattanaik. In an interview with Indian Express pegged to the global release of the film, he suggested that the quote translates differently. When he discovered what Oppenheimer quoted from the Bhagavad Gita, he was stumped, as he wasn't familiar with the quote, Pattanaik told the publication. \"I did some research on Oppenheimer, and I had never come across this line. I had never heard this line. Someone said it was chapter 11, verse 32, which really says 'kaal-asmi', which means 'I am time, destroyer of the world'. So, his translation itself is flawed. It is not 'I am death'. It is time, time is the destroyer of the world,\" he said. A similar observation was shared by Professor Stephen Thompson, who has spent more than 30 years studying and teaching Sanskrit, with Wired. Thompson suggested that Oppenheimer \"was obviously very attracted\" to Hinduism. Oppenheimer famously cited the passage from the Bhagavad Gita after successfully carrying out the Trinity test in New Mexico in 1945. \"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One... I am becoming death, the destroyer of worlds,\" the passage is often cited as saying. It made its way to Nolan's drama as well. Pattanaik explained Oppenheimer's interpretation of the verse from the Bhagavad Gita by the need to find some consolation, as he witnessed his scientific research turning into a real means of destruction. \"He gets excited because he's seeing death and destruction at a massive scale, and he's obviously seeking some kind of a spiritual background... He comes from a Judeo-Christian background, where God is known to punish people with floods and fire. This act of killing humanity with violence is very much a part of Biblical traditions; it's not a part of Hindu traditions, not a part of Jain or Buddhist traditions... I think he was looking for some solace, and he found this verse very dramatic,\" the writer said. Initially, the American physicist reportedly celebrated his feat, but later suffered from a guilty conscience following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which claimed over 110,000 lives. A lesser known fact is that Oppenheimer was invited to immigrate to India by the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, as noted in the biography of Indian physicist Homi Jehangir Bhabha (1909-1966) by Bakhtiyar K Dadabhoy released in April. Oppenheimer's pacifist views and allegations that he and his wife had communist links led to a probe by the US government in 1954, resulting in him being barred from taking part in policy decisions. Against this backdrop, Nehru offered Oppenheimer citizenship, which he politely declined as he still wished to be cleared of the charges that the US government made against him. According to Dadabhoy, Bhabha, who had become a good friend of Oppenheimer, was instrumental in convincing Nehru to send a secret letter to Oppenheimer offering him Indian citizenship. However, the scientists feared that he would be refused permission to visit India, and requesting a permit could increase suspicion about him. Cinema and sentiments This is not the first time that right-wing Hindu nationalists have taken offense to films, television shows, or commercials for their portrayal of Hinduism since the Modi government came to power in 2014. Some have been boycotted or even taken off the air following outcry from conservative and radical groups. In 2020, Netflix received backlash in India for a scene in the series 'A Suitable Boy' that depicted a Hindu woman and Muslim man kissing at a Hindu shrine. That year, Indian jewelry brand Tanishq was forced to withdraw an advertising campaign that was released during Diwali - the Hindu festival of lights - featuring an interfaith couple following online criticism. Analysts and film critics have pointed out a discernible paradigm shift in the tonality of Indian films as nationalist and Islamophobic narratives have gained momentum among a large section of the audience, allegedly tacitly supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Last year, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri's 'The Kashmir Files', a runaway hit at the box office and based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Hindus as they fled violent Islamic militants in the 1990s in the troubled northern Indian state that shares a border with Pakistan, drove a sharp schism among the audience. The film gave rise to mixed reactions, including \"gut-wrenching,\" \"truthful,\" and \"Islamophobic,\" depending on the political views of the polarized audience. Similarly this year, the release of 'The Kerala Story' about a Hindu girl from India's southernmost state, who was enticed to join the Islamic State terrorist group, provoked another round of controversy, and many called it propaganda to further marginalize Muslims - the country's largest minority group - under the Modi government's rule.

            "text": "Maybe I\u2019m the only one brave enough to admit it, but unless you\u2019re an expert in the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer movie is hella confusing. If you\u2019re going into Nolan\u2019s three-hour epic expecting a straightforward biopic about the man who invented the Atomic bomb, and then (kinda, sorta) regretted it, you\u2019re in for a rude awakening. There are at least four different timelines\u2014which, in typical Nolan fashion, are all out of order, with no clear way to distinguish between them\u2014each depicting a different, complicated chapter of the physicist\u2019s life. In other words, Oppenheimer is the sort of movie that requires you to do a little homework first. Luckily, there are quite a few resources out there, beyond just a cursory read of the man\u2019s Wikipedia page. That includes a 2009 movie-length episode of the PBS history series, American Experience, titled The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer. It\u2019s a two-hour TV film, available for purchase on Apple TV, starring Oscar-winner David Strathairn as Oppenheimer, directed by documentary filmmaker David Grubin. Because The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a re-enactment-style documentary, it\u2019s focused entirely on helping understand the complicated story of Oppenheimer\u2019s life, without artistic choice and non-linear timelines getting in the way. Grubin walks viewers through the international race to build the atomic bomb during World War II. In the U.S., the project was helmed by a physicist named Robert Oppenheimer, who worked with his team in secret at Los Alamos, New Mexico. But Oppenheimer\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end with the U.S. dropping his invention on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, wiping out tens of thousands of Japanese lives. Though he never outright said he regretted working on the bomb, he did vocally warn against the U.S. developing a hydrogen bomb and advised the U.S. to cooperate in an international agreement to put restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons. To top it all off, as the U.S. entered the Red Scare era, renewed suspicions of Oppenheimer\u2019s ties to the Communist Party caught the attention of the FBI. All of this led to an accusation, by a group of powerful Washington insiders, that Oppenheimer was working for the Soviet Union. This led to a hearing in which Oppenheimer attempted to restore his reputation, featuring a lot of men in suits testifying for and against the scientist. Like the prophet Avril Lavigne once said: It\u2019s complicated. The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer, aka Season 21 Episode 1 of American Experience, is available to buy digitally on Apple TV+ for $3.99. Trust me, it\u2019s a small price to pay before you settle into the three-hour baffling experience that is Oppenheimer. Set yourself up for success!",

            "text": "It\u2019s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d. But \u201cbiopic\u201d seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of Christopher Nolan\u2019s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. Oppenheimer is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, Oppenheimer is the ultimate monster movie. Cillian Murphy\u2019s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer\u2019s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It\u2019s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer\u2019s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy\u2019s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use. In fact, Murphy\u2019s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film\u2019s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (Matt Damon\u2019s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he\u2019s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he\u2019s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon. The version of Oppenheimer that we see on screen at any given time is a marker, an indication of which timeline we are currently inhabiting. Insights into his stellar early academic career are punctuated by glimpses of a later humiliating security clearance hearing that picked over every aspect of his life; the development of the bomb \u2013 the so-called Manhattan Project \u2013 is cut together with another hearing, this time in the Senate, to establish whether Oppenheimer\u2019s former colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, excellent) should be appointed in a federal government role. It\u2019s a knotty mesh of a structure. Time in Oppenheimer doesn\u2019t feel entirely linear \u2013 there are moments, in particular a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein, that seem unmoored from the rest of the film. Nolan\u2019s films frequently require a couple of viewings to unravel fully, and while it lacks the baffle-factor of Tenet, Oppenheimer is no exception. There are other problems: the cursory treatment of the female characters is one. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer\u2019s mistress Jean Tatlock, gets short shrift. And Emily Blunt, as J Robert\u2019s wife Kitty Oppenheimer, spends much of the first two hours mutinously clutching a martini on the edge of the frame. She does, however, claim a couple of terrific moments later on: a skin-flaying interrogation scene; a wordless glare that conveys the full nuclear winter of her animosity towards a disloyal colleague. But, for the most part, the film is a towering achievement. Not surprisingly, given Nolan\u2019s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in. There\u2019s no shortage of scenes of furious blackboard scribbling, the accepted cinematic signifier of scientific genius. But more interesting are the abstract moments; it\u2019s as though we are venturing into the heart of the atom itself. Equally inventive is the way the sets seem to quake at moments of tension. Oppenheimer\u2019s world is literally rocked by the shockwaves of the reaction that has been set in motion. Most effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer\u2019s upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there\u2019s a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It\u2019s taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer\u2019s career. But it takes on a mounting sense of threat with each use, as the catastrophic potential of the physicist\u2019s work becomes clear.",

Released in cinemas on Friday (21 July), Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist often referred to as the \u201cFather of the Atomic Bomb\u201d. The film is told using three timelines, with scenes of Oppenheimer\u2019s early life and work on the A-bomb being intermixed with scenes set during his 1954 security hearing, and the US Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) in 1959. While Oppenheimer has been praised for its meticulous recreation of its mid-20th century setting, one fan seemingly spotted an error in a scene set in 1945. The moment in question comes after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when Oppenheimer is called upon to deliver a speech to a cheering crowd, many of whom are waving US flags. \u201cIt was good and all, but I\u2019ll be that guy and complain they used 50-star flags in a scene set in 1945,\u201d wrote Twitter user @AndrewRCraig, alongside a still of the relevant scene. Period-accurate flags were used elsewhere in the film, such as the moment Oppenheimer stands beneath the 48-star flag at Trinity base camp. Some fans even argued that the mistake was in fact deliberate, and had been intended to subtly convey Oppenheimer\u2019s subjective recollections. \u201cPersonally i think it was done intentionally,\u201d they wrote, \u201cbecause coloured scenes were from Oppenheimer\u2019s perspective which is his present day\u2019s memory that was after the 50-star flag was established.\u201d Oppenheimer was released on the same day as Greta Gerwig\u2019s record-breaking toy adaptation Barbie, with both films combining for the year\u2019s biggest box office weekend. In a four-star review of Oppenheimer for The Independent, critic Clarisse Loughrey wrote: \u201cOppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s best and most revealing work. It\u2019s a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist\u2019s eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination. \u201cHere, Nolan treats one of the most contested legacies of the 20th century \u2013 that of J Robert Oppenheimer, the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d \u2013 as a mathematical puzzle to be solved.\u201d The film, which also stars Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, has provoked a backlash among right-wing Hindu groups in India, thanks to a scene featuring the Bhagavad Gita, one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest scriptures. Oppenheimer is out in cinemas now. Follow live updates on Oppenheimer and Barbie here.",

            "title": "'Oppenheimer,' 'Sound of Freedom' Glitches Reveal Big Movie Theater Issue",
            "text": "Sound of Freedom audiences aren't the only movie watchers to encounter inconvenient theater issues, with Oppenheimer now in the same boat.Despite being one of the summer's biggest blockbusters, tech problems have plagued the launch of Christopher Nolan's movie, with one filmmaker who encountered issues at his screening telling Newsweek the mistakes were \"comical.\"Conspiracy theories had been circulating online that for some reason, cinemas were \"suppressing\" audiences from watching Sound of Freedom\u2014a claim refuted by both AMC and the film's production company. That didn't stop the rumors as social media users shared pictures and videos of Sound of Freedom screenings being mysteriously shut down for a number of reasons.However, now Oppenheimer seems to be suffering from similar issues, as some showings of Nolan's latest epic have been hampered by issues. There doesn't appear to be a conspiracy behind these problems though, as it looks likely to be down to Nolan's decision to release Oppenheimer in 70 mm.Filmmaker and YouTuber Patrick Tomasso was at an opening night IMAX screening in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. With 40 minutes of the film remaining, the movie \"just stopped.\"\"[We were] confused at first, and then honestly [it felt] a bit comical,\" Tomasso told Newsweek, describing the mood within his screening of Oppenheimer. \"I have a feeling most people in attendance were film buffs and understood that it was quite the feat of projection engineering to screen the film so there wasn't much animosity from what I could gather from my perspective.\"70mm is a wide high-resolution film gauge for motion picture photography, and refers to the size of the physical film being it's projected onto the screen. Nolan has stated that this is the optimal way to view Oppenheimer. \"The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you're really letting the screen disappear. You're getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You've got a huge screen and you're filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You're immersing them in the world of the film.\" he told The Associated Press in June.However, in a digital world, it's now become an issue for movie theaters to revert back to 70mm in the opinion of professional projectionists.\"I had some knowledge of just how insane the print was for IMAX, it's huge,\" Tomasso said. \"Having been a projectionist in the early 2000s I knew even projecting 35mm was difficult, let alone 70mm at a runtime that's never been attempted before. I wasn't all that surprised when I heard the tech issues were so widespread.\"British movie blogger and former projectionist Paul Ferrer also appreciates the challenge Nolan set for cinemas.\"The tech issues with Oppenheimer are likely due to a lack of technical knowledge as these cinemas got rid of projectionists over a decade ago and those that are left haven't the knowledge and experience running film. It's one thing Christopher Nolan wanting Oppenheimer playing in cinemas on film the problem is the equipment used in many cinemas probably hasn't been maintained as well as it should be,\" he told Newsweek.Oppenheimer launched worldwide on July 21, but almost two weeks after release, there are still frequent glitches tarnishing the theater experience for viewers.\"I figured it was opening weekend issues that would be resolved. Fast forward to today though, and I still get comments hourly from people that are still experiencing tech issues which is just wild,\" Tomasso said. \"I know they've extended the IMAX run, which would make one assume they've figured out all the kinks, but that doesn't really seem to be the case. I'm sure there's far more successful screenings than one's with issues but we're nearly 3 weeks into the film's run and people are still saying they've had shutdowns mid-film, audio problems, bulb flicker, and dirty/scratched prints.\"There have been a number of social media users sharing their stories of screening issues. Reddit user u/JakeBurnsRed shared a picture of his cinema where the \"power went out 20 minutes into Oppenheimer.\" The issues didn't end there though.\"Waited about an hour for it to be restored and movie restarted, only for the movie to restart again automatically at the next show time and being kicked out of the theater. Didn't get to see the last 30 minutes or so,\" the Reddit user wrote as thousands of people commented on his woes.What caused Sound of Freedom's issues?While Oppenheimer's woes can be attributed to a mismatch between analogue and digital tech, Sound of Freedom's issues are harder to explain.Soon after the movie's release on July 4, various social media users started to go viral for sharing stories of theaters abruptly stopping the movies. These issues have included broken air conditioning, unexplained fire alarms, lighting glitches and more.While the finger was pointed at AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas venues, the AMC CEO Adam Aron denied allegations they were \"suppressing attendances\" for the movie. The producers of Sound of Freedom, the Harmon brothers who started Angel Studios, thanked him for his support.Despite this public interaction, conspiracy theories continued to suggest there was a reason that Sound of Freedom, a true story about Tim Ballard's mission to stop a global child sex-traffick ring, was having a tough time at cinemas.\"I did hear about the issues with Sound of Freedom but they do sound like conspiracy theories with people looking for a story that's not there as AMC and studio Angel denied it, of course denying it just makes it even more of a conspiracy,\" professional projectionist Ferrer told Newsweek. \"I guess as with Oppenheimer these are just random tech issues that happen all the time but social media and TikTok make them into a story.\"Sound of Freedom and Oppenheimer's combined problems within theaters may be down to the lack of investment put into the movie theater industry, suggests Tomasso, as the rise of streaming has provided an alternative place to showcase new releases.\"I put all of this on the cinemas themselves. I don't think it's Nolan's fault or even IMAX's\u2014 theaters have been complaining about streaming for years now, and as soon as they get a massive opportunity to remind the world that going to the movies is an experience that can't be replicated at home they fumble the bag,\" Tomasso said.Both Oppenheimer and Sound of Freedom have seen spectacular returns at the box office. According to Box Office Mojo, Oppenheimer has made over $419 million worldwide since it was released on July 21. Sound of Freedom, which was made with a significantly smaller budget, has made $153 million domestically, and has yet to be released internationally. Add to these figures the number 1 movie in the world right now, Barbie which has taken in over $800 million, and it's clear to see that movie theaters are enjoying a boost, the likes of which we haven't seen since before the pandemic.Newsweek has reached out to the IMAX Corporation via email for further comment on the issues Oppenheimer has allegedly faced in cinemas.",

            "title": "Oppenheimer: Cillian Murphy gives a commanding turn. But why is Florence Pugh reduced to Crazy Naked Chick?",
            "text": "Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning American Prometheus, Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer is a remarkable feat of engineering and propulsion. Over a relentless three hours, Oppenheimer impregnates committee meetings and disciplinary hearings with the grammar of high-octane cinema. Temporal jumps, Jennifer Lame\u2019s dynamic edits and Hoyte van Hoytema\u2019s ceaseless cinematography approximate a perpetual-motion machine. When the camera isn\u2019t tracking and trailing purposefully striding characters, it pans, zooms and racks. Particles, waves and chain reactions routinely dance across the screen. Ludwig Goransson\u2019s swooping score is jollied along by insistent triads and bombastic brass. Even the foreshadowing is loud: \u201cIf only I could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico,\u201d the title character wonders, a few scenes before he and his team descend upon Los Alamos to develop and design an atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy\u2019s charming, enigmatic Oppenheimer is whisked through various timelines and monochrome interludes: meeting Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) at Oxford, his early communist activism at Berkeley, arrogant showdowns with his prospective recruiters Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey jnr) and General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) and the humiliating 1954 hearing that saw the architect of the Manhattan Project lose his security clearance. Dozens of supporting characters \u2013 Tom Conti\u2019s Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie\u2019s Edward Teller, Gary Oldman\u2019s President Truman \u2013 are caught in Oppenheimer\u2019s gravitational pull. Nolan\u2019s screenplay lightly questions its subject as it lionises. The script can\u2019t entirely account for the slippery character\u2019s metamorphosis from the father of the atomic bomb to the peace mongering \u201ccrybaby\u201d who is run out of Truman\u2019s office. The most unpleasant incidents from Oppenheimer\u2019s life \u2013 his violence towards college classmates; his disdain for the graduate students he taught \u2013 are excised entirely. Tellingly, we never see the post-atomic images that Oppenheimer flinches while watching. Other disparaging details are extenuated or glossed over. Oppenheimer\u2019s intellectual fidgeting \u2013 which arguably haunted him on his deathbed more than anything else \u2013 is never explored. Nor what Einstein called his autoritdtsdusel, or stupor in the face of authority. Womanising is mentioned, yet one of Oppenheimer\u2019s extramarital conquests is reduced to a glib punchline. Downey jnr\u2019s Strauss questions Oppenheimer\u2019s post-Hiroshima hand-wringing but Nolan is far too enthralled with Oppenheimer and Murphy\u2019s commanding portrayal to follow suit. Awed onlookers frequently sound as if they are pitching for a book blurb: \u201cYou see beyond the world we live in,\u201d goes one remark. \u201cThe great salesman of science,\u201d goes another. Yes, about that. The film\u2019s representation of science is bafflingly facile, even if the chalkboard squiggles on quantum dynamics and quantum physics in the background are undoubtedly (knowing Nolan\u2019s fastidiousness) accurate. \u201cLight is both a particle and a wave!\u201d Oppenheimer cheerily (and anachronistically) imparts to a student. It\u2019s equally unfortunate that the women characters are doughily undercooked. It is a blessed relief when Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) gets a big scene in the closing third, not least, we imagine, for Blunt, who plays Drunk Refrigerator Mom for two hours of the film. Florence Pugh\u2019s Jean Tatlock is distilled from a real-world intellectual and political influence to Crazy Naked Chick, a glistening pair of breasts that weigh on Oppenheimer\u2019s mind. One particular explicit scene between the pair \u2013 you\u2019ll know which one \u2013 uses a device that proves a toe-curling R-rated embarrassment. Nolan, an otherwise virtuoso film-maker, has little aptitude for on-screen bunga bunga and the results are bungle bungle. Oh well. The filmmaker\u2019s technique generally counterpoints any caveats and script imperfections. The ensemble cast is starry and strong. The segue from the end of the second World War into the cold war is marked by a spectacular explosion sequence. \u201cBrilliance makes up for a lot,\u201d Murphy\u2019s Oppenheimer tells us. It sure does.",

            "text": "In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the Olympian gods and gave it to humanity, thus equipping mortals with the means to spread civilisation. For his transgression, he was damned to eternal torment by Zeus, the king of the Olympians. In western tradition, Prometheus has represented the eternal quest of humans for knowledge, and the tragedy that often accompanies this quest. For a biography of scientist J Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967), the title American Prometheus is apt. It captures the tragedy of Oppenheimer's life as much as the weight of his achievements, and sets up a book that is meticulously detailed and emotionally engaging. Written over a period of 25 years by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, American Prometheus (2005), won the Pulitzer Prize in 2006 in the category of Biography. A new paperback edition of the book, which is the inspiration for Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic film that released worldwide on Friday (July 21), was published earlier this year. American Prometheus draws from Oppenheimer\u2019s own writings, years of FBI surveillance records, and interviews with some of his closest friends and peers. It paints a gripping portrait of the \u2018father of the atomic bomb\u2019, who was ostracised by the political establishment of the very country he strove to protect. \u201cHe is America\u2019s Prometheus.an immensely human figure, as talented as he was complex, at once brilliant and naive, a passionate advocate for social justice and a tireless government adviser whose commitment to harnessing a runaway nuclear race earned him powerful bureaucratic enemies,\u201d the book says. American Prometheus works on multiple levels to tell the story of Oppenheimer and his times. It is first and foremost a deeply personal biography, replete with anecdotes from throughout Oppenheimer\u2019s life. Largely chronological, it builds up, bit by bit, his complex and evolving persona. In doing so, it attempts to provide a better explanation of the more public and well known aspects of his life. For instance, the book situates Oppenheimer's sympathies for communism in his highly privileged and protected upbringing. \u201cSomehow one always knew he felt guilty about his gifts, his personal wealth,\u201d it quotes a close friend as saying. It also chronicles Oppenheimer\u2019s quirks and eccentricities, anger and frustrations, optimism and fears, and perhaps most importantly, his intricate thought processes and oft conflicted ethical compass. At another level, the book tells the story of the developing field of nuclear physics in the early to mid 20th century. Through the story of Oppenheimer and his contributions, the book details the progress made in physics at the time, the culmination of which \u2014 in the book \u2014 is the development of the atomic bomb. About Oppenheimer\u2019s time at the laboratory in Los Alamos and his work in building the atomic bomb, the book goes into a lot of detail, with an entire section dedicated to it. This section, like the rest of the book, weaves a number of themes into a coherent, tense narrative, depicting the technological, logistical, ethical, and political challenges faced by Oppenheimer\u2019s Avengers-like team of scientists and engineers. Lastly, the book is in many ways a history of the US during the decades preceding and succeeding World War II. Through the telling of Oppenheimer\u2019s story, it opens a window to the times he lived in, right up to the McCarthyite \u2018Red Scare\u2019 of which Oppenheimer would become the most famous casualty. Over the years, Oppenheimer\u2019s life has fascinated many, not least because of how easily it lends itself to so many popular archetypes \u2014 tortured genius, tragic hero, and philosopher scientist. American Prometheus too utilises these tropes, but without ever descending into cliche. It simply states facts borne out of years of rigorous research. The tragedy tells itself. ======================= American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin Atlantic Books 770 pages Rs 799 (paperback)",

            "title": "Oppenheimer&#8217;s Guilt And The Tragedy Of The Atom Bomb",
            "text": "The life of the putative father of the atom bomb, Robert Oppenheimer, is explored in great depth in the three-hour long eponymous biopic which is now being screened worldwide. The film brings to life one of the 20th century\u2019s most important and controversial scientists. I first heard of his name in my physics classes at the Adamjee Science College in Karachi in the late 1960s. That is where I also heard the names of many physicists who appear in the film or whose names are mentioned in it: Albert Einstein, Ernest Lawrence, Enrico Fermi, and Neil Bohr, just to name a few. But I knew little about his life until I saw the film. He emerges as a man who was born and raised in New York and who went on to become a theoretical physicist because he was no good in the lab. Oppenheimer studied at the best institutions in the US and Europe and was justifiably proud of his intellectual skills. When someone referred to Albert Einstein as the greatest scientist of the time, he corrected him, saying that Einstein was the greatest scientist of his time nearly two decades ago. Oppenheimer was not your typical physicist. He was a man with a wide range of interests that spanned women, leftist politics and languages. He learned Sanskrit so that he could read the sacred Hindu text, Bhagavad Gita, in the original script. During the Second World War, Hitler posed a big threat to the Western powers as did Japan. Germany had many excellent physicists and there was a fear they would develop the atom bomb for Hitler. But, as Oppenheimer opined: Hitler was very antisemitic and many of the scientists in Germany were of Jewish origins. So, there was hope but no guarantee that Hitler would not get the dreaded weapon in time. After a careful screening process, Oppenheimer was appointed to head the top-secret Manhattan Project, charged with building an atom bomb. He picked a remote site in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the atom bomb would be built. He had owned a ranch in that desolate part of the US and was familiar with the terrain. Oppenheimer had hoped the bomb would be used against Hitler, and so had Einstein. But before that could happen, Hitler committed suicide just as Berlin was about to fall to the Soviets. Attention now turned to Japan. The hardliners in Washington, headed by President Truman, were concerned that Japan would not surrender unless it was hit with an atom bomb. He and his advisors weighed the pros and cons of hitting a Japanese city where thousands of civilians who had done no harm to the US would be killed. Once the bomb had been successfully tested at a site called Trinity near Los Alamos, a decision was made to drop it from a B-29 on Hiroshima, supposedly to save American and, yes, even Japanese lives. Oppenheimer was fully aware of the role he had played in the bomb\u2019s development and the devastation it would unleash on innocent civilians. But there is no evidence he objected to its use over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. In the film, no footage is provided of the devastation unleashed on the innocent people of Hiroshima when it exploded in the air above them at 8:45 am. The horrifying images, preserved for generations at the museum in Hiroshima, never make it to the screen. In the movie, we see a man who is not just haunted by the past but a man who is overcome with paranoia about the future of the human race How could Oppenheimer not have known what the bomb did to the Japanese? How could he have missed the strong condemnations it drew in the US, which are documented here and here? None of this is shown in the film. On 7 August, the day after, General Douglas MacArthur, who would later accept the Japanese surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, said he was \u201cappalled and depressed by this Frankenstein monster.\u201d Later, he would say, that there was \u201cno military justification for the dropping of the bomb.\u201d On 8 August, before the second bomb was dropped over Nagasaki, former President Herbert Hoover wrote, \u201cThe use of the atomic bomb, with its indiscriminate killing of women and children, revolts my soul.\u201d John Foster Dulles, who would serve as Secretary of State under President Eisenhower, urged President Truman to forgo additional use of the new weapon because it carried out \u201cindiscriminate obliteration of human beings.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019d lost the war, we\u2019d all have been prosecuted as war criminals,\u201d said US Air Force General Curtis LeMay. \u201cWe had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages,\u201d Fleet Admiral William Leahy, chair of the chiefs of staff under both presidents Roosevelt and Truman, wrote in his autobiography, I Was There. Admiral Chester W Nimitz, the commander in chief of the US Pacific fleet, insisted that the atomic bombs dropped over Hiroshima and just three days later over Nagasaki were \u201cof no material assistance in our war against Japan.\u201d The official Strategic Bombing Surveys in 1946 concluded that \u201cJapan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped.\u201d Years later, in 1963, former President Dwight Eisenhower, who was the Allied commander in Europe during World War II, recalled that in July 1945 he had opposed using the atomic bomb on Japan during a meeting with Secretary of War Henry Stimson: \u201c[\u2026] I told him I was against it on two counts. First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn\u2019t necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\u201d He said they were \u201ccompletely unnecessary\u201d and \u201cno longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.\u201d In his memoir, The White House Years, Eisenhower would write that he had \u201cgrave misgivings\u201d about the morality of the bombings. As the first explosion took place at Trinity, according to some accounts, he is believed to have said, \u201cNow, I am become death: the destroyer of the worlds\u201d These statements must have haunted Oppenheimer for years and for decades. While awake, he must have been assailed with doubts about what he had done. While asleep, he must have been racked with nightmares. In the movie, we see a man who is not just haunted by the past but a man who is overcome with paranoia about the future of the human race. He keeps on saying that it\u2019s just a matter of time before the Soviets develop their atomic bomb and the pressure mounts on the US to develop the hydrogen bomb, a weapon that would be several times more devastating than the atom bomb. Sure enough, that day came to pass. It was tested in November 1952 under the leadership of Edward Teller. Years later, Albert Einstein would comment: \u201cMankind invented the atomic bomb, but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap.\u201d Oppenheimer died at the young age of 62 from throat cancer, leaving behind a burning legacy. There is no doubt he was a brilliant scientist and that he did a remarkable job administering and managing a team of egotistical and mercurial physicists at Los Alamos. Without him, the atom bomb might not have been developed for years. The movie then shifts to showing another aspect of his life. He had leftist sympathies and the hawks in the US political circles did their best to discredit him for being a communist and a Soviet agent. The inquiries to besmirch his name dragged on for years. Ultimately, his loyalty was accepted but his security clearance was revoked. Decades later, it would be restored posthumously during the Biden administration. He may have been a loyal American citizen, a man of integrity, a brilliant physicist and an amazing administrator. But history is not going to be kind to him. It is unlikely to absolve him of the sin of developing a weapon the likes of which the world had never seen and a weapon which would be used not once but twice to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children, some immediately, some years later, and some decades later. In addition to those who died, there were hundreds of thousands of others, if not millions, whose lives were devastated. Eventually, as Oppenheimer had feared, the Soviets developed their own atomic bomb in 1949, and in 1953, their own hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer had kindled a fire that no one could put out. It did not stop there. The weapon went on to trigger a never-ending arms race between the US and the USSR that was increasingly dangerous and expensive. If all the billions and billions being spent on nuclear weapons had instead been spent on human and social development, the quality of life of the world\u2019s 8 billion residents today would have been so much better. Of course, the arms race did not remain confined to the US and the USSR. In 1952, the UK exploded its first atomic bomb. France followed suit in 1960 and China in 1964. In 1966, Israel is believed to have tested its first atomic bomb. In 1974, India exploded its first atomic bomb, just miles away from the border with Pakistan. The operation, for reasons best known to the Indians, was named \u201cSmiling Buddha.\u201d In 1998, India went on to explode five atomic bombs. Pakistan, always anxious to do a one-up on India, exploded six. Today, the list of countries that are on the verge of developing nuclear weapons extends to Iran and North Korea. Oppenheimer passed away in 1967 of throat cancer, aged only 62. He must have been a deeply troubled man, seeing that he had opened the veritable Pandora\u2019s Box. Atomic creatures were flying uncontrolled from continent to continent, terrorising and threatening humanity on every continent. But what he had once said to Einstein on the shores of a lake in Princeton, New Jersey, may yet come to pass. There, even before the first atomic bomb had been tested, a pensive Oppenheimer had confided to Einstein that the atomic bomb could set off a chain reaction, setting the entire globe on fire. As the first explosion took place at Trinity, according to some accounts, he is believed to have said, \u201cNow, I am become death: the destroyer of the worlds.\u201d The fact that it did not happen in his life does not mean that it will not happen in our lives. California\u2019s former governor, Jerry Brown, and former Defense Secretary William Perry put it in plain English just three years ago, \u201cA nuclear war that could end civilisation \u2013 whether it is started intentionally or accidentally \u2013 is a real possibility\u2026 We now face a true emergency \u2013 an absolutely unacceptable state of world affairs that has eliminated any margin for error. We ask world leaders to join us in 2020 as we work to pull humanity back from the brink without any further delay. The Doomsday Clock now stands at 100 seconds to midnight, in what is arguably the most dangerous situation that humanity has ever faced. Now is the time to come together \u2013 to unite and to act.\u201d",

            "title": "\"Barbie\" vs. \"Oppenheimer\": U.S. politics could learn a lot from the lessons in these movies",
            "text": "In \"Barbie,\" America Ferrera's character Gloria tells us that it's impossible to be a woman, while \"Oppenheimer\" demonstrates that the violence of patriarchy also makes it impossible to be a good man. When faced with the consequences of their own actions, both Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and Barbie (Margot Robbie) seek to exercise strong leadership that is remorseful, accountable and rooted in feminist values of repair and community \u2014 but in Oppenheimer's patriarchy, as in the patriarchy of our real world, practicing feminist leadership is punished. Recently, Warner Bros., perhaps inspired by the underlying message of \"Barbie,\" apologized for tweets that made light of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, just days before the anniversary of these events. This is a version of leadership that Oppenheimer was denied and that Barbie is able to enjoy: strength through accountability and repair. When \"Barbie begins,\" we see snippets of an idealized Barbieland. Lawyer Barbie stands up in court and says, \"I have no difficulty holding both logic and feeling at the same time. And it does not diminish my powers, it expands them.\" On the other hand, as a successful man in a patriarchal nation, Oppenheimer was denied feelings. He couldn't unionize his workplace without consequences and he couldn't express remorse or regret about the use of the atomic bomb. As soon as he did, he was punished. Our political leaders are similarly denied remorse. President Obama's visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, which marked the first time a U.S. president had visited the site where nuclear bombs were first used in warfare, was derided as an apology tour. \"Barbie's' Gloria (Ferrera) is exasperated. \"I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us,\" she said. I, too, am just so tired \u2014of seeing men contort themselves to hide their best qualities: kindness, softness, joy, and care. I am so tired of men choosing to be hard in order to not be seen as feminine. I'm so tired of men choosing violence, emotional and physical, of excusing the violence of other men, in order to stay in the boys club. I am so tired of the gender binary reinforcing patriarchy, and of patriarchy reinforcing the gender binary. I'm so tired of men attacking women and the queer community to prove themselves to other men. I'm so tired of \"girl dads\" being celebrated, rather than girl dad qualities being extended to children of all genders. We all lose when these are our societal norms. Oppenheimer (Universal Pictures)In both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" men perform masculinity for other men, preserving their egos by harming the women around them: in \"Barbie, the Kens battle throughout the film, only working together when attacking what Barbie has built. Her dream house becomes Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House, and the Barbies become subservient to the Kens. In \"Oppenheimer,\" women are sexual fantasies, mothers-to-be or mothers. In both cases, as trophy wives or fantasies, for men to prove their worth to one another, for patriarchy to succeed, women must be the second sex and queerness must be isolated (Sorry, Allan). What would have happened if Oppenheimer lived in Barbieland \u2013 a world, Will Ferrell tells us, without real weapons? What could he have created, what world would we live in today, if he had been able to hold feelings and logic, and the U.S. had never developed or dropped the atomic bomb? In \"Oppenheimer,\" when the rules break down and he begins to question the scale of violence that the state is pursuing, he is punished. In \"Barbie,\" when the rules break down and her heels hit the floor, her community surrounds her with care and concern. She is encouraged to seek out the root causes of her unease. And, in the real world, she is confronted with the consequences of her life: that she has been complicit in creating impossible standards for women, and that the Kens have been taken for granted. In \"Oppenheimer,\" the only accountability he faces is damage to his career, his ego and his sense of self. He is never accountable to communities most harmed by his work. He imagines the damage of the bomb, but unlike Barbie, he is never confronted with the communities he has hurt, the lives destroyed by his creation. Even at the end of the movie, as he fears the world has been set on fire, he never has to experience loss like the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or downwinders, Indigenous communities and uranium miners across the southwest U.S. have. The day I saw \"Oppenheimer,\" I also watched a Congressional hearing on Afghanistan. Like \"Oppenheimer,\" the hearing had no testimony from communities directly impacted by U.S. militarism. We continue to repeat our history because we have failed to practice accountability, listen to dissent and address harm with community, care and a commitment to repair. And part of why we have not learned these lessons is because patriarchy, as we see in the film, punishes dissent so effectively that we are afraid of dissenting at all. Just look at how Ken is scared of dissenting until he is introduced to patriarchy. Neither the Kens nor Los Alamos' scientists can break ranks without punishment. Barbie (Warner Bros.)Unlike Oppenheimer, Barbie is directly confronted with the harms of promoting an idealized feminine image and, through Gloria, is reimagined as an ordinary Barbie celebrating a life renewed through the promise of equality. She is confronted with the impact of taking Ken for granted: instead of seeking equality, the Kens enact revenge, trashing Barbieland and taking steps to consolidate their power. When the Barbies come back to restore Barbieland, almost miraculously, Barbie apologizes. She knows she has taken Ken for granted, and the other Barbies also realize that the weight of unyielding leadership has become too heavy. It's both a burden and an opportunity; one that they want to share. \"Barbie's\" matriarchy is imperfect, but that is the point: it is capable of evolution, and the movie follows not just Barbie's journey, but the journey of Barbieland as it adapts to new challenges. Barbieland's challenges are flat feet, the revolution of the Kens, and adopting variations of Barbie with existential crises. Our challenges in the real world are many: climate crisis, endless militarism and a patriarchal, homophobic and racist state. \"Barbie\" shows us it is possible to adapt to meet those challenges. We can prioritize abundant life, instead of violence and power. We can follow Barbie's lead and work with Allan to enact queer liberation. We can build a society based on accountability and care. If we imbue feminist values into our politics and our culture, our institutions and how we treat one another, we can uproot patriarchy and embrace abundant care for one another. And maybe then, we can have more dance parties and fewer nukes.",

FPJ Web DeskUpdated: Friday, July 14, 2023, 03:12 PM IST Ahead Of Oppenheimer, PVR To Re-Release Christopher Nolan Movies: From The Dark Knight Trilogy To Interstellar | Christopher Nolan's upcoming biopic 'Oppenheimer' is touted to be one of 2023's biggest projects. The filmmaker, who is known for projects such as 'Memento', 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, 'Inception', 'Tenet' and others has always been a cinephile favourite, and someone who believes in delivering movies slow-cooked to perfection.

As per reports, PVR will be re-releasing some of Nolan's greatest films in cinema halls ahead of 'Oppenheimer's release. These include 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, 'Inception', 'Interstellar', and 'Dunkirk'. The re-release of Nolan films will begin on July 17 and will go on till July 20. View this post on Instagram Ahead of the release, the filmmaker shared that the story of 'Oppenheimer\u2019, which is based on nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, is full of paradoxes and ethical dilemmas. Speaking about what ignited the fire within him to tell J. Robert Oppenhimer's story, Nolan said: \"Oppenheimer's story is one of the great stories that there is. It's full of paradoxes and ethical dilemmas, and that's the kind of material I'm always interested in. While the movie tries to help the audience understand why people have done the things they've done, it's at the same time asking 'Should they have done the things they've done?'.\" He further mentioned: \"Films, as a narrative medium, are uniquely suited to pulling an audience into a subjective experience, letting them judge things the way the characters judge them, while at the same time looking at these characters a little more objectively. At various points, we try to burrow into Oppenheimer\u2019s psyche and take the audience on his emotional journey. That was the challenge of the film: To tell the story of a person who was involved in what was ultimately an extraordinarily destructive sequence of events, but done for the right reasons, and tell it from his point of view.\" Produced by Universal Pictures (distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery), 'Oppenheimer' will release on July 21 across theatres in India with advance booking across IMAX theatres in India already open.

What Is Japan's Nuclear Attack Connection With Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer? Oppenheimer is all set to release in theaters on July 21, 2023 FPJ Web DeskUpdated: Monday, July 17, 2023, 01:54 PM IST Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's much-awaited film Oppenheimer is all set to release in theaters worldwide on July 21, 2023. The film is based on American theoretical physicist, Julius Robert Oppenheimer, who built the most destructive weapon known to man and then advocated against nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer is often credited as the \"Father of Atomic Bomb\". The upcoming film has brought back into focus the American scientist and how and why he developed the atomic bomb during World War II. Japan's Nuclear Attack Connection With Oppenheimer The physicist was not in favor of using the atomic bomb in a nuclear attack on Japan and was said to be distraught when it was used not once but twice. Read Also Oppenheimer Screening: Here's How You Can Win Christopher Nolan's 70 MM Reel Oppenheimer developed the atomic bomb as a part of his Manhattan Project. The US government project aimed to develop a nuclear weapon before the Germans could do so. The atomic bomb was used in 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima by the US on August 6, 1945. The second atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki by the US on August 9, 1945. The nuclear holocaust ended World War II. In an interview post the nuclear attack, Oppenheimer had quoted a line belonging to Bhagavad Gita, which says, \"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\" He had reportedly said, \"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed (after the nuclear attack), a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince (Arjuna) that he should do his duty, and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form, and says 'Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds'.\" Actor Cillian Murphy plays the titular role in the film. The the three-hour historical epic is set during World War II, when he understood that testing the atomic bomb would ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world, yet he pushed the button anyway.

            "title": "I watched Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer in Ukraine: his Greek tragedy is our reality",
            "text": "Following the recent release of Wes Anderson\u2019s Asteroid City, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer continues to infuse summer 2023 with atomic energy. Stylistically, of course, the two couldn\u2019t be more different. What Anderson shows as a blast outside a diner\u2019s window that doesn\u2019t so much as interrupt the characters\u2019 coffee, Nolan shapes into a three-hour epic. And as a Ukrainian, I am grateful for that. While daily life in the war-time state constantly fluctuates between feeling like a farce and a Greek tragedy, Oppenheimer emphasises the real level of the threat \u2013 something I often feel western Europe the and wider world don\u2019t fully grasp. Nolan\u2019s Greek tragedy is the world that I live in. Watching Oppenheimer from my local cinema in Kharkiv I hope that \u2013 to a smaller degree \u2013 a global audience will experience Ukraine\u2019s everyday anxiety too. Nolan\u2019s use of sound is what makes his take different from the many other Oppenheimer biopics. So much so that I would see it in the cinema again, purely to focus on how various pieces of music, noises and silences guide the viewer\u2019s attention. As my seat shakes from the stereo effects, nobody in the nearly full cinema flinches. The teenagers to my right are as used to explosions as J. Robert Oppenheimer himself. The moments of silence (a Nolan trademark) however, feel ominous. It is said that you will never hear \u201cyour\u201d missile \u2013 the one that kills you. Locals in Kharkiv use this wisdom to calm our nerves after hearing a loud explosion. As we sit through the nearly three-hour film, our only wish is not to hear the bomb siren sound outside, since it would mean we would have to leave the cinema and go to the underground shelter. Granted that in a city so close to the border, shelters aren\u2019t of much use. It takes about 30 seconds for an S-300 missile to fly from the nearby Russian town of Belgorod, meaning we often hear the siren after the blast. Unsurprisingly, explosions sounds are a leitmotif of the film too, making its soundscape very relatable. What Nolan gets wrong The overarching motif of Oppenheimer is a warning against the precarious reality that Ukrainians live in now. As one great scientist notes to Oppenheimer: \u201cwe now enter a new world\u201d. The warning shapes the symphonic structure of the film which is, perhaps, the most mature of Nolan\u2019s works. Oppenheimer is true to Nolan\u2019s greatest cinematic talents. But it speaks to his weaknesses as well. Oppenheimer\u2019s children don\u2019t get any screen time, but are shown through a nagging baby cry. The women fall similarly short of becoming real, depicted simply as dedicating their lives to Oppenheimer. I appreciate Nolan not trying to crawl into someone else\u2019s skin, instead opting to explore the perspective (that of a white, privileged man) he can personally empathise with. But as a viewer watching from the other side of nuclear anxiety, I found the film\u2019s depth of representation lacking. Nolan\u2019s wide strokes, though powerful, miss detail. The USSR is called \u201cRussia\u201d and Soviet scientists are called \u201cRussians\u201d throughout the film. Watching it several kilometres from a Ukrainian lab where the first lithium atom in the USSR was split, this feels ironic. The massive shelling of the nuclear research reactor by the Russian military in 2022 created an uproar in my local community precisely because so many people here have family and friends who work in physics. Ukraine\u2019s nuclear research programme, which had been a subject of great pride, was now endangered. In painting all the scientists in the film as Russians, Oppenheimer ignores the work of historic Ukrainian physicists. In the end, Oppenheimer is not a film about historical accuracy or justice, but rather a great emotional and sensory experience. And for a summer blockbuster, what more can we ask? As I walk out of the cinema, the siren starts to roar, signalling that somewhere in the depth of Russia, a fighter jet carrying ballistic missiles has taken off, harmonious with the last scene of Nolan\u2019s film. I walk through the warm summer evening, feeling strangely more like a Wes Anderson character than a Nolan one. Perhaps, I think, if the explosion blasts behind my back, I won\u2019t even drop my mint lemonade. Because I already live in the \u201cnew world\u201d of dark nuclear absurdity \u2013 one that even Oppenheimer himself could not possibly have predicted. Looking for something good?

            "title": "Oppenheimer Almost Discovered Black Holes Before He Became \u2018Destroyer Of Worlds\u2019 - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "J. Robert Oppenheimer, now the protagonist of a much-anticipated film hitting theaters on July 21, is today most known for his scientific leadership of the U.S. Manhattan Project, the World War II\u2013era crash program to build the first-ever atomic bombs. But just a few years earlier, Oppenheimer had found himself pondering very different \u201cweapons\u201d of mass destruction: black holes\u2014although it would be decades before that name arose. \u201cIt was influential; it was visionary,\u201d says Feryal \u00d6zel, an astrophysicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, of Oppenheimer\u2019s work on black holes and neutron stars, the superdense corpses of expired massive stars. \u201cHe has a lasting impact.\u201d \u00d6zel is a founding member of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, which released the first-ever image of a black hole in 2019\u201480 years after Oppenheimer co-authored a paper theorizing that such objects could exist. \u00d6zel isn\u2019t the only leading modern physicist to admire Oppenheimer\u2019s work on black holes. \u201cIt stands up completely; there are no flaws,\u201d says Kip Thorne, an emeritus professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology. Thorne won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for his work with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which in 2015 detected gravitational waves from two colliding black holes. \u201cIt went so far beyond anything that anybody else had ever done,\u201d Thorne says of Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201ctour de force\u201d paper exploring black holes, which runs only five pages long. \u201cIt is amazing what is contained there.\u201d Oppenheimer\u2019s brief foray into astrophysics began with a 1938 paper about neutron stars, which continued in a 1939 installment that further incorporated the principles of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. He then published a third paper on black holes on September 1, 1939\u2014but at the time, it was scarcely noticed because this was the very day Germany invaded Poland, launching World War II. Oppenheimer never wrote on the topic again. Even if it hadn\u2019t been overshadowed by war, Oppenheimer\u2019s work on neutron stars and black holes \u201cwas not understood to be terribly significant at the time,\u201d says Cathryn Carson, a historian of science at the University of California, Berkeley. Each paper was written with a different member of the swarm of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars that Oppenheimer carefully cultivated. These prot\u00e9g\u00e9s facilitated his ability to jump between research topics\u2014and ultimately, according to Thorne and others, represent one of his most important contributions to physics. Oppenheimer\u2019s climactic third paper, written with his student Hartland Snyder, explores the implications of general relativity on the universe\u2019s most massive stars. Although the physicists needed to include some assumptions to simplify the question, they determined that a large enough star would gravitationally collapse indefinitely\u2014and within a finite amount of time, meaning that the objects we now know as black holes could exist. \u201cEventually there should emerge what we would now call a singularity at the origin, a point of infinite density where, in some sense, spacetime itself rips, and there should become what we would now call an event horizon,\u201d says David Kaiser, a physicist and historian of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThis is all in that paper\u2014not in the modern vocabulary, but the mathematics is absolutely recognizable to us today.\u201d In the decades since Oppenheimer and Snyder\u2019s black hole bombshell, scientists have confirmed that the same principles hold even without the simplifying assumptions initially put in place. Thorne says that the paper is particularly staggering, given contemporary work from an even more famous physicist\u2014the one who developed general relativity in the first place. \u201c[Albert] Einstein published almost simultaneously a paper in which he argued that you cannot have a star or any object shrink to the size of what we now call the gravitational radius or the size of a black hole,\u201d Thorne says. \u201cEinstein was completely wrong.\u201d But despite the merit of Oppenheimer and Snyder\u2019s work on black holes, the topic simmered on physicists\u2019 back burner for decades\u2014and today is perhaps best known as a sobering example of how brilliant ideas can be overlooked, says Manuel Ortega-Rodr\u00edguez, a theoretical physicist at the University of Costa Rica. \u201cIt struck me as really, really interesting and fascinating and scary that such an idea was there for like 25 years, and nobody paid attention,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means that today we could have an equally revolutionary idea right now that the community is ignoring.\u201d",

            "text": "Waves of pink-clad moviegoers passed under carboard palm trees on the frenzied first day of \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d After a feverish drumbeat propelled forward by a mushroom cloud of memes, the most anticipated day on the year\u2019s movie calendar finally arrived as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 two movie opposites brought together by cross-marketing fate \u2014 landed in theaters. \u201cI think it\u2019s the contrast,\u201d said Lucy Ruiz, 17, as she and a friend made their way into the first showing of \u201cBarbie\u201d on Thursday at the Alamo Drafthouse in Yonkers, New York. \u201cIf you want to do both in the same day, it\u2019s like two sides of the same coin.\u201d For Ruiz, the second half of her \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d would have to wait. \u201cMaybe next week,\u201d she said of seeing \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d But many are flocking to see both on opening weekend. The National Association of Theater Owners says some 200,000 moviegoers in North America have booked same-day tickets to each movie. The movie of the summer has turned out to be not \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d or \u201cThe Flash,\u201d but a double feature. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like this,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Leary, president of the theater association, who compared the phenomenon to a sold-out Taylor Swift concert tour. \u201cBut while that\u2019s an amazing special event that captures the cultural attention, it\u2019s not accessible to everybody the way these two movies are. This is a phenomenon open to everyone, regardless of where they live.\u201d As of Friday, it was already clear \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d had morphed into the movie event of the year. The collision of Greta Gerwig\u2019s bright satire of the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, wasn\u2019t cannibalizing ticket sales for either but fueling excitement for the most jarring and color-clashing of movie weekends. Studios forecasts had hovered around an $80 million opening weekend for \u201cBarbie\u201d and about $40 million for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d But it\u2019s likely that both will greatly exceed those totals, and maybe even \u2014 especially in the case of \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 double them. Warner Bros. said Friday that \u201cBarbie\u201d took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth. For a movie industry that still hasn\u2019t entirely recovered its pre-pandemic footing, it\u2019s a much-needed jolt of moviegoing joy in a summer season where many of the top releases have fallen shy of expectations. Overall sales on the year are running about 20% below the box-office pace of 2019. As much as the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d fanfare has been driven by internet fascination, it\u2019s in many ways an old-school movie weekend. Both movies are roundly acclaimed, original works by two of the best filmmakers working today. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has been hailed as a masterpiece; in my review, I called it \u201ca kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty.\u201d The Associated Press\u2019 Jocelyn Noveck called \u201cBarbie\u201d \u201cbrash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all eye-poppingly lovely.\u201d For some moviegoers, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is their first blush with the once common practice of catching a double feature. Jack Robinson, 17, had tickets to see both movies with friends Saturday. He planned to don a suit for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before changing into pink for \u201cBarbie.\u201d \u201cI used to go to the movies a lot with my family and friends before corona happened. I\u2019m very excited,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to not leave the movie theater. Usually, it\u2019s like bathroom and go home.\u201d In recent years, theater owners have often bemoaned not having enough films in the marketplace as streaming made inroads and studios increasingly concentrated their release schedules on fewer but bigger films. But \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d points to the possible reward when a varied group of films collective rise the box-office tide. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d may have momentarily eclipsed last week\u2019s top film, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d \u2014 which, despite Tom Cruise\u2019s lobbying, is losing IMAX screens to \u201cOppenheimer\u201d this weekend. But having three big movies in close proximity to one other, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cis a good problem to have.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly preferable to the alternative,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. Parrot Analytics found that global demand for the casts of each film \u2014 all of whom have been publicly enthusiastic about seeing their rival movie \u2014 grew at virtually the same rate between late April and mid-July. The audience demographics are almost opposite one another. \u201cBarbie\u201d is appealing to a largely female and younger audience, while \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is most popular with males and those over the age of 30, Parrot found. Yet in a much-divided America, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d has been the great pop-culture unifier of 2023. There is harmony in contrast. \u201cI\u2019m doing \u2018Barbie\u2019 first and then \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 because I know \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 is going to be something I have to digest,\u201d says Jill Kupnick of Brooklyn. Movie theaters are catering to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon with double feature tickets and plenty of \u201cBarbie\u201d-themed promotions of candy and cocktails.

At the Yonkers Alamo Drafthouse, a sharply dressed man wearing a pink shirt beneath a blazer inquired about showtimes for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d A clerk courteously answered and then, noticing the man\u2019s attire, asked, \u201cDid you want times for \u2018Barbie,\u2019 too?\u201d READ ALSO: Movie Review: Barbie\u2019s life in plastic looks fantastic READ ALSO: In \u2018Oppenheimer,\u2019 Nolan builds a thrilling, serious blockbuster for adults Movies and TV",

The National Association of Theater Owners says some 200,000 moviegoers in North America have booked same-day tickets to each movie. The movie of the summer has turned out to be not \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d or \u201cThe Flash,\u201d but a double feature. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like this,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Leary, president of the theater association, who compared the phenomenon to a sold-out Taylor Swift concert tour. \u201cBut while that\u2019s an amazing special event that captures the cultural attention, it\u2019s not accessible to everybody the way these two movies are. This is a phenomenon open to everyone, regardless of where they live.\u201d As of Friday, it was already clear \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d had morphed into the movie event of the year. The collision of Greta Gerwig\u2019s bright satire of the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, wasn\u2019t cannibalizing ticket sales for either but fueling excitement for the most jarring and color-clashing of movie weekends. Studios forecasts had hovered around an $80 million opening weekend for \u201cBarbie\u201d and about $40 million for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d But it\u2019s likely that both will greatly exceed those totals, and maybe even \u2014 especially in the case of \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 double them. Warner Bros. said Friday that \u201cBarbie\u201d took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth. For a movie industry that still hasn\u2019t entirely recovered its pre-pandemic footing, it\u2019s a much-needed jolt of moviegoing joy in a summer season where many of the top releases have fallen shy of expectations. Overall sales on the year are running about 20% below the box-office pace of 2019. As much as the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d fanfare has been driven by internet fascination, it\u2019s in many ways an old-school movie weekend. Both movies are roundly acclaimed, original works by two of the best filmmakers working today. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has been hailed as a masterpiece; in my review, I called it \u201ca kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty.\u201d The Associated Press\u2019 Jocelyn Noveck called \u201cBarbie\u201d \u201cbrash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all eye-poppingly lovely.\u201d For some moviegoers, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is their first blush with the once common practice of catching a double feature. Jack Robinson, 17, had tickets to see both movies with friends Saturday. He planned to don a suit for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before changing into pink for \u201cBarbie.\u201d \u201cI used to go to the movies a lot with my family and friends before corona happened. I\u2019m very excited,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to not leave the movie theater. Usually, it\u2019s like bathroom and go home.\u201d In recent years, theater owners have often bemoaned not having enough films in the marketplace as streaming made inroads and studios increasingly concentrated their release schedules on fewer but bigger films. But \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d points to the possible reward when a varied group of films collective rise the box-office tide. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d may have momentarily eclipsed last week\u2019s top film, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d \u2014 which, despite Tom Cruise\u2019s lobbying, is losing IMAX screens to \u201cOppenheimer\u201d this weekend. But having three big movies in close proximity to one other, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cis a good problem to have.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly preferable to the alternative,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. Parrot Analytics found that global demand for the casts of each film \u2014 all of whom have been publicly enthusiastic about seeing their rival movie \u2014 grew at virtually the same rate between late April and mid-July. The audience demographics are almost opposite one another. \u201cBarbie\u201d is appealing to a largely female and younger audience, while \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is most popular with males and those over the age of 30, Parrot found. Yet in a much-divided America, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d has been the great pop-culture unifier of 2023. There is harmony in contrast. \u201cI\u2019m doing \u2018Barbie\u2019 first and then \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 because I know \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 is going to be something I have to digest,\u201d says Jill Kupnick of Brooklyn. Movie theaters are catering to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon with double feature tickets and plenty of \u201cBarbie\u201d-themed promotions of candy and cocktails. But most are programming their own \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d days. Freelance writer Kelsey Weekman called it \u201cthe closest we\u2019ve come to having school spirit week as adults.\u201d \u201cI have a friend who has outfits picked out and knows how she\u2019s styling her hair,\u201d Krupnick says. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of play involved that you rarely see in more mainstream cinema. It\u2019s more common with Marvel movies or in the fantasy genre than something like this.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d have melded together so much that it\u2019s become possible \u2014 despite their vast differences \u2014 to confuse one for the other. At the Yonkers Alamo Drafthouse, a sharply dressed man wearing a pink shirt beneath a blazer inquired about showtimes for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d A clerk courteously answered and then, noticing the man\u2019s attire, asked, \u201cDid you want times for \u2018Barbie,\u2019 too?\u201d READ ALSO: Movie Review: Barbie\u2019s life in plastic looks fantastic READ ALSO: In \u2018Oppenheimer,\u2019 Nolan builds a thrilling, serious blockbuster for adults Movies and TV",

            "title": "Christopher Nolan&#8217;s Oppenheimer: A look at the scientist&#8217;s fascination with Hinduism, and why he quoted the Bhagavad Gita after the bomb was tested",
            "text": "As fans in India excitedly wait for the release of Christopher Nolan's new film, Oppenheimer, many have revisited the famed nuclear physicist's iconic reference to the Bhagavad Gita. Oppenheimer has often quoted from the sacred text, making the words synonymous with his achievements. Oppenheimer's research resulted in the creation of the first nuclear bombs. He immediately understood the gravity of what he had helped create, and has often said that the first words that ran through his mind after the bomb was successfully tested in the New Mexico desert in 1945 were from the Gita: \"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One. I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.\" According to Time Magazine, Oppenheimer read the Gita for his 'personal delight' in the evenings, and sometimes to entertain friends. A copy of the sacred text, bound in pink and held together by scotch tape, was placed in his Princeton study. He took lessons in Sanskrit, his eighth language, from Professor Arthur W Ryder at Berkeley, and was particularly fond of the couplet, \"Scholarship is less than sense, therefore seek intelligence.\" According to his colleague, the Nobel Prize winner Isidor Rabi, Oppenheimer was 'overeducated' in fields that 'lie outside the scientific tradition', such as his interest in the Hindu religion. Rabi said, \"He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was. [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.\" A Time Magazine report published in 1948 recounted his story, and quoted Brigadier General Thomas F Farrell as describing Oppenheimer's demeanour on the fateful day. \"He grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself . . . When the announcer shouted 'Now!' and there came this tremendous burst of light, followed . by the deep-growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief.\" Years later, he would still be impacted by the ethical complexities of creating a bomb capable of such destruction. Deployment of two atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki effectively brought World War 2 to an end. But the destruction caused by something that he had helped create confirmed Oppenheimer's fears. He told fellow physicists, according to the obituary that the New York Times published on his death in 1967, that the bomb \"dramatised so mercilessly the inhumanity and evil of modern war.\" He added, \"In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatements can quite extinguish,\" he went on, \"the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.\" In a news interview following the bombings on Japan, Oppenheimer once again recalled the emotions that were felt in the control room on the day of the test. \"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another.\" He made an effort to regulate atomic energy by heading the Atomic Energy Commission's General Advisory Committee of top nuclear scientists. He also served on the atomic committee of the Research and Development Board to advise the military. The 1945 test will be featured prominently in the film Oppenheimer, as the trailers have shown. One of the most haunting images of the trailer shows Oppenheimer's face lit up by the light of the explosion. The film will be released in theatres across the world on July 21, and advance booking for it began three weeks prior to release date. Although recent reports suggest that advance bookings were temporarily halted because the film received an A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J Sherwin, Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy in the lead role, alongside Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh and others.",

            "title": "Barbenheimer: What order should you watch Barbie and Oppenheimer in this weekend?",
            "text": "In one of the more bizarre (and entirely unofficial) marketing crossovers of recent years, Friday (21 July) marks \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d day \u2013 with Barbie and Oppenheimer hitting cinemas simultaneously. Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour biopic about the \u201cFather of the Atomic Bomb\u201d J Robert Oppenheimer, who is played by Cillian Murphy opposite co-stars including Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon. Meanwhile, Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is adapted from the popular Mattel toy franchise, and stars Margot Robbie in the title role and Ryan Gosling as Ken. With the two films out on the same day, many people have committed to seeing them one after the other, as part of a self-curated double bill. The radically different tones of the two films has, however, provoked some debate regarding the optimal order in which to view the films. Some have argued that the lighter tone of Barbie would make it a good pallette cleanser after the intensity of Oppenheimer, while others have claimed that the heavy content of Nolan\u2019s film would overshadow the levity of Barbie, should you watch it in that order. Many people, including actors and critics, have weighed in on the best order to watch \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d. Barbie star Issa Rae advised people to \u201csee Oppenheimer first then cleanse your palate with Barbie\u201d. \u201cI want to have mimosas and drinks and cocktails after Barbie, I don\u2019t want to like, sulk,\u201d she said, during a red carpet interview. West Side Story star Rachel Zegler wrote on Twitter: \u201cI think it\u2019ll be Barbie first because i think Oppenheimer will hurt my brain and i would rather not be thinking about it during Barbie.\u201d Little White Lies film critic Hannah Strong wrote: \u201cI have been considering it and i think Barbie then Oppenheimer is the correct order because we must sit with the weight of humanity\u2019s sins after enjoying some brief joyful respite from the horror.\u201d Film critic Scott Mantz wrote: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve seen #BARBENHEIMER, I highly recommend watching #BARBIE first, then #OPPENHEIMER! Barbie is really fun, but Oppenheimer stays with you \u2014 you don\u2019t wanna be thinking about Oppenheimer while watching Barbie! (Or maybe you do?)\u201d Robbie and Gosling, meanwhile, proposed their own solution to the quandry. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect double bill,\u201d said Robbie to AP. \u201cStart your day with Barbie, then go straight into Oppenheimer, and then a Barbie chaser.\u201d Gosling agreed: \u201cMy suggestion would be Barbie first, Oppenheimer for lunch, and then a Barbie chaser.\u201d You can follow along with the latest updates here, with a frontrunner seemingly emerging in the two-horse race for box office supremacy.",

This is a phenomenon open to everyone, regardless of where they live.\u201d As of Friday, it was already clear \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d had morphed into the movie event of the year. The collision of Greta Gerwig\u2019s bright satire of the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, wasn\u2019t cannibalizing ticket sales for either but fueling excitement for the most schizophrenic and color-clashing of movie weekends. Studios forecasts had hovered around an $80 million opening weekend for \u201cBarbie\u201d and about $40 million for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d But it\u2019s likely that both will greatly exceed those totals, and maybe even \u2014 especially in the case of \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 double them. Warner Bros. said Friday that \u201cBarbie\u201d took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth. For a movie industry that still hasn\u2019t entirely recovered its pre-pandemic footing, it\u2019s a much-needed jolt of moviegoing joy in a summer season where many of the top releases have fallen shy of expectations. Overall sales on the year are running about 20% below the box-office pace of 2019. As much as the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d fanfare has been driven by internet fascination, it\u2019s in many ways an old-school movie weekend. Both movies are roundly acclaimed, original works by two of the best filmmakers working today. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has been hailed as a masterpiece; in my review, I called it \u201ca kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty.\u201d The Associated Press\u2019 Jocelyn Noveck called \u201cBarbie\u201d \u201cbrash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all eye-poppingly lovely.\u201d For some moviegoers, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is their first blush with the once common practice of catching a double feature. Jack Robinson, 17, had tickets to see both movies with friends Saturday. He planned to don a suit for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before changing into pink for \u201cBarbie.\u201d \u201cI used to go to the movies a lot with my family and friends before corona happened. I\u2019m very excited,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to not leave the movie theater. Usually, it\u2019s like bathroom and go home.\u201d In recent years, theater owners have often bemoaned not having enough films in the marketplace as streaming made inroads and studios increasingly concentrated their release schedules on fewer but bigger films. But \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d points to the possible reward when a varied group of films collective rise the box-office tide. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d may have momentarily eclipsed last week\u2019s top film, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d \u2014 which, despite Tom Cruise\u2019s lobbying, is losing IMAX screens to \u201cOppenheimer\u201d this weekend. But having three big movies in close proximity to one other, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cis a good problem to have.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly preferable to the alternative,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. Parrot Analytics found that global demand for the casts of each film \u2014 all of whom have been publicly enthusiastic about seeing their rival movie \u2014 grew at virtually the same rate between late April and mid-July. The audience demographics are almost opposite one another. \u201cBarbie\u201d is appealing to a largely female and younger audience, while \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is most popular with males and those over the age of 30, Parrot found. Yet in a much-divided America, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d has been the great pop-culture unifier of 2023. There is harmony in contrast. \u201cI\u2019m doing \u2018Barbie\u2019 first and then \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 because I know \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 is going to be something I have to digest,\u201d says Jill Kupnick of Brooklyn. Movie theaters are catering to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon with double feature tickets and plenty of \u201cBarbie\u201d-themed promotions of candy and cocktails. But most are programming their own \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d days. Freelance writer Kelsey Weekman called it \u201cthe closest we\u2019ve come to having school spirit week as adults.\u201d \u201cI have a friend who has outfits picked out and knows how she\u2019s styling her hair,\u201d Krupnick says. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of play involved that you rarely see in more mainstream cinema. It\u2019s more common with Marvel movies or in the fantasy genre than something like this.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d have melded together so much that it\u2019s become possible \u2014 despite their vast differences \u2014 to confuse one for the other. At the Yonkers Alamo Drafthouse, a sharply dressed man wearing a pink shirt beneath a blazer inquired about showtimes for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d A clerk courteously answered and then, noticing the man\u2019s attire, asked, \u201cDid you want times for \u2018Barbie,\u2019 too?\u201d",

            "text": "NEW YORK - Waves of pink-clad moviegoers passed under carboard palm trees on the frenzied first day of \"Barbenheimer.\" After a feverish drumbeat propelled forward by a mushroom cloud of memes, the most anticipated day on the year's movie calendar finally arrived as \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" -- two movie opposites brought together by cross-marketing fate -- landed in theaters. \"I think it's the contrast,\" said Lucy Ruiz, 17, as she and a friend made their way into the first showing of \"Barbie\" on Thursday at the Alamo Drafthouse in Yonkers, New York. \"If you want to do both in the same day, it's like two sides of the same coin.\" For Ruiz, the second half of her \"Barbenheimer\" would have to wait. \"Maybe next week,\" she said of seeing \"Oppenheimer.\" But many are flocking to see both on opening weekend.

            "text": "Waves of pink-clad moviegoers passed under carboard palm trees on the frenzied first day of \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d After a feverish drumbeat propelled forward by a mushroom cloud of memes, the most anticipated day on the year\u2019s movie calendar finally arrived as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 two movie opposites brought together by cross-marketing fate \u2014 landed in theaters. \u201cI think it\u2019s the contrast,\u201d said Lucy Ruiz, 17, as she and a friend made their way into the first showing of \u201cBarbie\u201d on Thursday at the Alamo Drafthouse in Yonkers, New York. \u201cIf you want to do both in the same day, it\u2019s like two sides of the same coin.\u201d For Ruiz, the second half of her \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d would have to wait. \u201cMaybe next week,\u201d she said of seeing \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d But many are flocking to see both on opening weekend. The National Association of Theater Owners says some 200,000 moviegoers in North America have booked same-day tickets to each movie. The movie of the summer has turned out to be not \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d or \u201cThe Flash,\u201d but a double feature. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like this,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Leary, president of the theater association, who compared the phenomenon to a sold-out Taylor Swift concert tour. \u201cBut while that\u2019s an amazing special event that captures the cultural attention, it\u2019s not accessible to everybody the way these two movies are. This is a phenomenon open to everyone, regardless of where they live.\u201d As of Friday, it was already clear \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d had morphed into the movie event of the year. The collision of Greta Gerwig\u2019s bright satire of the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, wasn\u2019t cannibalizing ticket sales for either but fueling excitement for the most jarring and color-clashing of movie weekends. Studios forecasts had hovered around an $80 million opening weekend for \u201cBarbie\u201d and about $40 million for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d But it\u2019s likely that both will greatly exceed those totals, and maybe even \u2014 especially in the case of \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 double them. Warner Bros. said Friday that \u201cBarbie\u201d took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth. For a movie industry that still hasn\u2019t entirely recovered its pre-pandemic footing, it\u2019s a much-needed jolt of moviegoing joy in a summer season where many of the top releases have fallen shy of expectations. Overall sales on the year are running about 20% below the box-office pace of 2019. As much as the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d fanfare has been driven by internet fascination, it\u2019s in many ways an old-school movie weekend. Both movies are roundly acclaimed, original works by two of the best filmmakers working today. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has been hailed as a masterpiece; in my review, I called it \u201ca kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty.\u201d The Associated Press\u2019 Jocelyn Noveck called \u201cBarbie\u201d \u201cbrash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all eye-poppingly lovely.\u201d For some moviegoers, \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is their first blush with the once common practice of catching a double feature. Jack Robinson, 17, had tickets to see both movies with friends Saturday. He planned to don a suit for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before changing into pink for \u201cBarbie.\u201d \u201cI used to go to the movies a lot with my family and friends before corona happened. I\u2019m very excited,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to not leave the movie theater.

Warner Bros. said Friday that \u201cBarbie\u201d took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth.

            "text": "The movie ably skewers Mattel\u2019s own brand messaging, pointing out that this \u201cfeminist\u201d toy is overseen and controlled entirely by men. But Will Ferrell\u2019s CEO character isn\u2019t here to rehash his \u201cLord Business\u201d character from The Lego Movie. He might be the latest in a long line of white male CEOs at a megacorporation but he\u2019s not in this for the money, he\u2019s in it for the dreams of young girls (in the least creepy way possible). Because ultimately, neither half of Barbenheimer has come to bury America; they\u2019ve come to praise it. Warts and All \u2013 Just Not Too Many In Oppenheimer we never see the bombs fall on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Our viewpoint is firmly fixed to characters in the United States. When scenes are in color, it is to tell us we are viewing someone\u2019s subjective experience (Oppenheimer didn\u2019t have sex with Jean Tatlock during his security hearing) while black and white sequences are from the perspective of Oppenheimer\u2019s hidden nemesis, Atomic Energy Commission head honcho, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Both are subjective perspectives, neither leave the cast of American characters. So we see the bombs fall as they did, hearing about it over the radio, imagining it in nightmares. Viewed harshly, you could be forgiven for thinking Oppenheimer argues the worst thing about dropping nuclear bombs on Japan was that it made a few American scientists sad. It is certainly weak tea compared to works such as Rod Serling\u2019s Carol for Another Christmas. This politically-charged Christmas special is no more graphic in its portrayal of the bomb, and the sets it builds to show Hiroshima after the bomb dropped are no more convincing than those in Barbieland. But during his service, Rod Serling toured Japan after Oppenheimer\u2019s bombs fell, and his descriptions of children whose faces were melted by the blast will stay with you. And they should. Oppenheimer brings us blinding white light, ghostly images of peeling skin, one glimpse of a charcoaled corpse, and a loud, overpowering racket that is frankly par for the course in Nolan\u2019s sound mixing. And the justifications, at every step of the way people are justifying why this bomb needs to be built. We are told that they have to drop the bombs to end the war, that there is no other way, and this is not just told to the characters, it is told to us, the audience. The trolley dilemma is set up neatly, and if you are reluctant to pull the handle and switch the train tracks, you simply don\u2019t understand the gravity of the situation. Oppenheimer seeks to portray itself as a hard look at the ethical consequences of the Manhattan Project, but everywhere you look, there are the vague lumps of objects brushed under the rug, When Oppenheimer chooses the site for Los Alamos, a great deal is made of what a completely unoccupied piece of land it is, but when the bomb has been dropped and someone asks Oppenheimer what he wants to do with the land now, he answers, \u201cGive it back to the Indians.\u201d The truth is, for those willing to look, there is plenty of information out there about the people who were kicked out of their homes to make way for Oppenheimer\u2019s secret town. Barbie also does its bit to justify and defend its legacy, and that is not surprising. For all of Oppenheimer\u2019s faults, it is not actually (as far as we know) directly funded by the U.S. Military. But unlike Oppenheimer, Barbie has put a lot more thought into what its audiences are thinking. It takes the time to answer actual criticisms its audience may have, rather than shadowboxing straw men.",

            "title": "Oppenheimer the actor: the curious 1946 film Atomic Power featuring the scientist as himself",
            "text": "Atomic Power, a groundbreaking 18-minute black-and-white film about the Manhattan Project which created the world\u2019s first atomic bomb, may not be as famous as Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2023 epic, Oppenheimer. However, this largely overlooked 1946 cinematic experience was pioneering in communicating the history behind the nuclear detonation in the New Mexico desert on July 16 1945. Particularly striking in Atomic Power is that leading figures play themselves, including Robert Oppenheimer, Leslie Groves and even Albert Einstein. This film, which offers a unique window on the dawn of the Atomic Age, resonates with its 2023 counterpart. Atomic Power was released when only 44,000 US households had television, so millions saw it in cinemas. It was part of a major American newsreel series, The March of Time (1935-1951), created by Time magazine\u2019s co-founder Henry Luce and produced by Louis de Rochemont. These films were \u201ca unique combination of newsreel and documentary formats\u201d. They involved dramatised recreations and commentary on significant current events, and are regarded as having a profound impact on contemporary filmmaking. Even the narration by Cornelius Westbrook Van Voorhis \u2013 whose \u201cvoice epitomised 20th-century announcer speak\u201d \u2013 was genre-defining. However, telling this story comes with many problems. Both films struggle to juggle depicting genius and technological advance with the reality of nuclear power. Nuclear messages on film The message of 2023\u2019s Oppenheimer blockbuster has been variously interpreted. Some critics have focused on how the atomic bomb represents a fundamental change in global technology its portrayal of Oppenheimer and other figures grappling with the moral dilemmas around this. Other critics, however, have suggested the film \u201cskirts around the human suffering caused by the bomb\u201d. Oppenheimer\u2019s grandson Charles summarised the film\u2019s central question as: \u201cAre we going to destroy ourselves as a species?\u201d But in the same Time interview, he added that \u201cthe movie, while really good, had less emphasis than I would have put\u201d on the crucial period of 1945 to 1947, during which Atomic Power was made. That film\u2019s poignant release date, August 9 1946, was exactly a year after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in Japan. In contrast to 2023, the world did not yet have nuclear-armed rockets, nuclear-powered submarines, nor even commercial nuclear power stations. At that time, the US was the only country with nuclear weapons \u2013 only 11 bombs in 1946, deliverable by propeller-driven B-29 bombers. And there were even US proposals being discussed at the UN for the (unsuccessful) Baruch Plan. Named after Bernard Baruch, the US representative to the UN\u2019s Atomic Energy Commission, this plan sought to dismantle all US nuclear weapons and place atomic technology under international control. The plan failed largely on account of the Soviet Union\u2019s abstention and pursuit of a counter proposal. Russia believed the UN to be insufficiently independent, and that the plan would simply protect the US\u2019s atomic monopoly. These negotiations were not helped by the US\u2019s Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific during July 1946, nor by the Soviet Union engaging in its own secret atomic bomb programme. Atomic Power\u2019s message is similarly complicated. Having initially echoed concerns about the new technology, it ends up hoping for peace and responsible use while featuring news footage and a reference to the ill-fated Baruch Plan. But the film largely focuses on communicating the technological triumph of creating an atomic bomb. It opens with images of buildings in a devastated Hiroshima, then cuts to a staged grocery store conversation with an unnamed American woman who is lamenting the loss of life. A similarly anonymous pastor offers a one-sentence morality injection: It\u2019s overstepped the bounds of moral law by producing this diabolical weapon. While featuring such perspectives appears thought-provoking, these are in fact brushed aside almost immediately, replaced with scientific explanations and the project\u2019s story. Potential dangers are revisited later, but purely through the hypothetical threats to US cities. Surreal moments Oppenheimer is noted for its sometimes surreal and \u201cartful\u201d depictions. Atomic Power\u2019s dramatisation, though seemingly more conventional, offers equally surreal takes. Most striking is a scene involving Vannevar Bush and James B. Conant, who both played significant government oversight roles in the Manhattan Project. Real nuclear detonation footage is interspersed with the two \u201cwitnessing\u201d the blast by lying on the desert sand \u2013 facing away, shielding their eyes when turning round, then casually shaking hands. There\u2019s not even a breath of wind to ruffle their hair. This unbelievably detached re-enactment was filmed in a Boston garage \u2013 and the scene reflects wider disparities between the reality and the cinematic recreation. Conant\u2019s own account, written the day after the real event, conveyed a great sense of fear when facing the bomb. Oddly, Atomic Power barely features Oppenheimer, who is reduced to a single scene with two lines. In a desert control room, just before detonation, he speaks with his close friend and Manhattan Project consultant, Isidor Isaac Rabi: Oppenheimer: \u201cThe automatic control\u2019s got it now. Rabi, this time the stakes are really high.\u201d Rabi: \u201cIt\u2019s going to work alright Robert, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll never be sorry for it.\u201d Oppenheimer: \u201cWell, in 40 seconds we\u2019ll know.\u201d This subconscious hinting at Oppenheimer\u2019s inner doubts, and of his being at the mercy of a mechanical process, foreshadow his later public challenging of US nuclear policy and being sidelined through \u201cpolitical machinations\u201d \u2013 both powerful themes that are central to the 2023 biopic. In contrast to Oppenheimer, Einstein is given greater accolades in Atomic Power \u2013 reified for his \u201cgenius\u201d discoveries and letter to US president Franklin D. Roosevelt that made nuclear weapons possible. Yet his only words near the film\u2019s end are \u201cI agree,\u201d which he says in response to a statement by the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists (of which Einstein was Chairman) appealing for support for funding to educate the public. Even military figures have surprisingly limited profiles in the film. Groves\u2019s only line, having led the project, is cautioning an unnamed scientist to be careful with a $50m plutonium test-tube. Ironically, this portrayal hints at the very real military-scientific tensions during and after the project. Atomic Power\u2019s final words are the catchphrase that the series was by then well-known for: \u201cTime \u2026 marches on!\u201d Indeed it did, yet we continue to be drawn to this complex and murky story and what it tells us about humanity. I\u2019m sure Oppenheimer won\u2019t be the last time filmmakers attempt to tell it. Atomic Power can be watched for free through the BFI player Looking for something good?

            "text": "Two highly anticipated films, Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, and Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, debuted in theatres on July 21. While Barbie has outperformed Oppenheimer at the global level, the situation is reversed in India. The Indian audience has shown strong support for Oppenheimer, featuring actors Cillian Murphy in the lead role, propelling it to join the Rs 100 crore club on its 13th day of release. While Oppenheimer earned more than Rs 2 crore on day 13 in theatres, Barbie earned Rs 70 lakh, bringing the film's total collection in to Rs 37.55 crores. As per the data from industry tracker Sacnilk, Oppenheimer's earnings on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday fell within the range of Rs 2.60 crore to Rs 2.85 crore. With these recent collections, the film's total earnings have now reached Rs 100.3 crore. Oppenheimer is based on the life of nuclear physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who is known as the father of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer also stars Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Kenneth Branagh, and Florence Pugh in significant roles. Oppenheimer is facing strong competition from Karan Johar's Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, which was released on July 28. Starring Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh, the film opened with Rs 11.5 crore. Three Hollywood films, Fast X, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, and Oppenheimer, have crossed the Rs 100 crore mark this year in India. Indian Express critic Shalini Langer gave the film 4.5 stars. A part of the review read, \u201cChristopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer isn\u2019t just about the chain reaction that is set off when a neutron hits the nucleus of an atom. It\u2019s more about the chain reaction every time great power falls into great hands. Cillian Murphy as that man, Robert J Oppenheimer, is curious and ambitious, but also charmingly flippant, as well as conflicted and broken.\u201d",

            "title": "Oppenheimer review: Christopher Nolan\u2019s dark, immersive epic gives Cillian Murphy the role of his career",
            "text": "Nolan is known for his dark visions, but this is the most profoundly pessimistic work yet. That said, Oppenheimer \u2013 which is as intimate and tender as Nolan\u2019s early masterpiece Memento \u2013 is frequently very funny. If we\u2019re still alive in 2024 (and the movie suggests imminent destruction is closer than we think) it should clean up at the Oscars. The script is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus, and gives 47-year-old Cillian Murphy, who\u2019s never played the lead in a blockbuster, the role of his career. We follow the New York-born Oppenheimer from Cambridge student to old man, (though not chronologically; the editing is fast, furious and, ultimately, mind-blowing). As played by Murphy, \u201cOppie\u201d widens his pretty blue eyes, flashes an electric smile and has a gentle, measured, hypnotically soothing voice. A charming and ambitious polymath, he\u2019s put in charge of the Los Alamos-based Manhattan Project, and races to save the world from the Nazis. Yet, Oppenheimer can also be hypocritical, arrogant, cowardly, narcissistic and, when he fancies it, disloyal. For a genius, he\u2019s capable of being a real dummy, too. He thinks he has the measure of the conservative politicians and army guys trying to ensure the Soviets don\u2019t derail this mission impossible. He\u2019s wrong. The building, and testing, of the bomb dominates the middle section of the movie, which contains a shocking act, sweaty suspense and top banter (Matt Damon, as a wryly no-nonsense army officer is on fine form; ditto Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer\u2019s frustrated wife, Kitty). We get colossal bang for our buck, and the horrific consequences for the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are heard and seen (though not in the way you might expect). In the third act, Nolan finds a unique way to tackle Oppenheimer\u2019s remorse (both with regard to the A-bombs and his lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh). Instead of watching him wring his hands, we\u2019re forced to pay attention to the outcome of two unofficial trials. One takes place in 1954, during the \u201csecond Red Scare\u201d, and sees Oppenheimer\u2019s reputation on the line. The other, held in 1959, revolves around a one-time acquaintance of Oppenheimer\u2019s, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, Lewis Strauss (a sublime Robert Downey Jr). What interests Nolan: how easy it is to lose sight of the bigger picture, a crime that both of these men are guilty of. The simultaneously old-school and new-school gorgeousness of Oppenheimer can\u2019t be overstressed (Nolan despises digital trickery; he uses film-stock, of the IMAX-friendly kind). This filmmaker is back on track. Though impeccably shot and acted, the much-lauded Dunkirk was overblown, while Tenet tried too hard to be clever. Oppenheimer (which again features Kenneth Branagh) avoids those pitfalls, the antithesis of a self-regarding, bigger-equals-better prestige project. In the Barbie vs Oppenheimer struggle, neither is the Goliath. Give peace a chance and see them both. Oppenheimer is in cinemas from Friday 180mins, cert 15",

            "text": "Oppenheimer (15A, 180mins) That dubious title would haunt him till the end of his days and he became a vocal proponent of detente, but nothing it seemed could wash away his mortal sin. There are powerful religious overtones to Oppy\u2019s story and Nolan\u2019s interpretation of it. Pale and gaunt, cast in shadows, Cillian Murphy (well cast and never better) is an agonised figure, his suffering central to an ambitious and multi-layered film that portrays him as both sinner and saint. Oppenheimer - Trailer When first we meet him, Oppenheimer has completed a degree in experimental physics at Harvard and come to Cambridge to study under Ernest Rutherford. The great scientist is not impressed: Oppy breaks things in the lab, is moody, bad at maths. But visiting Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) sees real potential in the chippy American and tells him to go to Germany to study under Max Born. From these many teachers, Oppenheimer synthesises grand theories expanding Einstein\u2019s assumptions and makes significant advances in nuclear theory and quantum mechanics. And when he returns to America to teach at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1929, he quickly acquires a reputation for brilliance. Which makes him the perfect man to head up the Los Alamos Laboratory, a secret project initiated by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 to develop a nuclear bomb. The group of scientists that Oppenheimer assembled would become central to the subsequent Manhattan Project and it was Oppy who chose the New Mexican wilderness as the site for the bomb\u2019s gestation. The Manhattan Project would, of course, lead to \u2018success\u2019 and the nightmares of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But Oppenheimer\u2019s flirtations with communism in the 1930s would later return to haunt him when his vocal opposition to the development of a hydrogen bomb put him in the sights of the McCarthy witch hunts. Murphy\u2019s Oppy is watchful, remote, ultimately unknowable, a seething mass of moral and philosophical contradictions A complex tale, and Nolan\u2019s intricate screenplay dances skilfully between various periods of Oppenheimer\u2019s life. He does not emerge as eminently likeable: he womanised constantly, seemed aloof and unknowable, and had episodes of mental instability. However flawed in his private life, Oppy was in some ways a man of principle, who incurred Harry Truman\u2019s displeasure by openly questioning the morality of nuclear weapons. Played in the film by Gary Oldman, Truman tells a flunky to get \u201cthat cry baby\u201d out of the Oval Office. Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock, communist activist, Oppenheimer\u2019s on-off lover and a tragic malcontent, while Emily Blunt is Kitty Puening, Oppy\u2019s loyal and long-suffering wife. Matt Damon is General Groves, the scientist\u2019s gruff overseer at Los Alamos, and Robert Downey Jr is Lewis Strauss, the slick businessman and politician who is Oppenheimer\u2019s ally. The acting in Oppenheimer is uniformly excellent and Murphy seems sure to get an Oscar nomination at least: his Oppy is watchful, remote, ultimately unknowable, a seething mass of moral and philosophical contradictions. As a piece of entertainment, Nolan\u2019s film is impeccable: the three hours fly by and his sleight of hand in recounting a devilishly complex tale is remarkable. There is a little too much exposition in the dialogue at times, which can sound stiff and over-clever. But the way he uses sound and music to ratchet up the tension as the first detonation approaches is exceptional: Nolan\u2019s film-making style is bombastic, unnuanced, but undeniably effective. Cillian Murphy says it 'took a toll' to play co-creator of atom bomb in Oppenheimer When those bombs are ready for use over Japan, Nolan makes a big decision: we only hear about the consequences of those explosions, and are shown none of the biblical misery they unleashed. It\u2019s a bit of a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t conundrum, but to me it felt dishonest. Overall, though, this is a film that ought not be missed and should be seen in a cinema. And Murphy gives us a tragic protagonist of Shakespearean proportions, not so much Prometheus as Icarus, a thin-skinned, tortured man whose ambition was his worst enemy. Four stars",

            "title": "Review: Gloomy, repetitive &#8216;Oppenheimer&#8217; is a, not the, bomb",
            "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is his most Christopher Nolany film to date. As such, his many acolytes will absolutely adore every moment of its sprawling three hours and extol its virtues to anyone who will listen. More casual moviegoers, however, are going to walk out wondering what, exactly, they just endured. The 52-year-old London native broke through with 2000\u2019s \u201cMemento,\u201d a complex and brilliant noir thriller about a man with a form of amnesia attempting to sort out both his past and his future. Shot in both color and black and white with a taut 113-minute running time, it established Nolan as one of the most creative filmmakers of his generation and allowed him to make a series of increasingly ambitious films, including the greatest comic book movie of all in 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d and earn five Oscar nominations on the way. Crucially, he spent two decades working exclusively for Warner Bros., a company that gave him the freedom to follow his muse. His 11th film \u201cTenet,\u201d a sci-fi time travel epic he spent more than 20 years conceiving, was due out in July 2020, a time when the pandemic brought everything \u2014 including the entire film industry \u2014 to a screeching halt. The studio eventually issued it in a staggered fashion later that year, making it the first would-be blockbuster to be released during COVID. Despite the fact that, according to the World Health Organization, the pandemic ultimately killed more than 6.9 million people, Nolan focused his fury on Warner Bros.\u2019 handling of his movie as well as the company\u2019s decision to simultaneously release its 2021 slate of films to both HBO Max and whatever theaters were open. So when it came time to make his take on the life of the father of the atomic bomb, Nolan entered a bidding war that Universal ended up winning. His demands speak to the industry\u2019s respect for Nolan\u2019s talents, as he was able to snag a $100 million production budget, the same amount for marketing, a theatrical window of at least 100 days, 20% of the first-dollar gross and a guarantee Universal would not release another film three weeks before and after \u201cOppenheimer\u201d hits screens in the heart of blockbuster season. Also, apparently, no one at Universal had the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to Nolan, who produced a bloated, repetitive and needlessly complex bomb that squanders the many things it has going for it. To wit, the massive cast is breathtakingly and uniformly spectacular. In the title role, frequent Nolan star Cillian Murphy fully embodies J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man of both arrogance and self-doubt, brilliance and profound regret. An unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr. truly loses himself playing U.S. Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt makes the most of her underwritten role as Oppenheimer\u2019s wife Kitty, while Florence Pugh excels in the much meatier part of his mistress. And Matt Damon, as the Army Corps of Engineers officer who oversaw the Manhattan Project, brings the film a hint of its only but much-needed levity, even if he\u2019s merely repeating a character he\u2019s played before, including during his stint as an airline pilot on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d Visually and sonically, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has much to offer. Nolan has crafted a true fever dream of a picture that slides effortlessly between inner and outer thoughts and subjective and objective narratives. The compelling score by Swedish composer Ludwig Goransson perfectly complements the suburb and explosive overall sound design. The trailer for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d: The film is largely framed around the aforementioned Manhattan Project, the top-secret World War II-era program that charged the world\u2019s top physicists with beating the Nazis in creating the first nuclear weapon. The concept of power and who wields it is central to the story along with the fundamental moral questions about creating a weapon that could very well destroy all of humanity. Nolan tells the tale in a non-linear fashion, skipping back and forth between key moments in Oppenheimer\u2019s life. It\u2019s a choice that gets frustrating and confusing at times, particularly given the many important characters added to the mix but barely introduced to viewers throughout the film. (As an actor, Murphy seems far more invested in keeping the audience abreast of which Oppenheimer era we\u2019re seeing than Nolan himself.) The film also spends too much time focused on procedural issues \u2014 Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Is this physicist we barely know going to quit the project in a huff? \u2014 and endlessly, gloomily repeats its key themes again and again. In a rare moment of humanity, Murphy is shown sitting naked across from his lover, his frail and hairless body giving the otherwise towering personality a hint of vulnerability. Of course, Nolan then repeats that imagery later in the film, blunting its power in the process. I found myself checking the time exactly twice while watching \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d The first time, I was legitimately surprised to see I was only at the halfway point, as it felt like the film was approaching its climax. The second time was during the centerpiece of the movie, the first test detonation of a nuclear weapon. Nolan chose to use as many practical, rather than computer-generated, effects as possible for the utterly dazzling and devastating sequence that will stick with viewers far longer than any of the tedious and morose scenes of gloomy talking heads in suits. The problem? There was still a full hour of those gloomy talking heads in suits left to go. \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Directed by: Christopher Nolan Starring: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh Rated: R for nudity and language Should you go? Great acting doesn\u2019t make up for a confusing, repetitive narrative. 2 stars",

            "text": "Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated movie finally arrives in cinemas on July 21 and it's been a long time coming. Since its release date was announced, fans have been analysing every single detail from the trailer to movie posters all the way to the UK premiere. The three-hour-long epic, which is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus, is going head-to-head with Greta Gerwig's Barbie at the Box Office. The two films have formed an unlikely but entertaining dual feature with fans dubbing the biggest weekend of Hollywood's calendar this year as 'Barbenheimer'. Nolan's film is expected to project \u00a350 million in its opening weekend, Forbes reports and has been receiving widespread praise from critics. With a 4-star rating, The Independent hailed it as 'clever' and 'imaginative'. While The Guardian noted it was 'flawed' but 'extraordinary'. The blockbuster tells the true story of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. So grab your popcorn, and turn off your phone as here's the entire cast of Oppenheimer, who they are playing and where you have seen them before. The cast of Oppenheimer Cillian Murphy - J. Robert Oppenheimer Emily Blunt - Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Oppenheimer Matt Damon - General Leslie Groves Jr. Robert Downey, Jr. - Lewis Strauss Florence Pugh - Jean Tatlock Benny Safdie - Edward Teller Michael Angarano - Robert Serber Josh Hartnett - Ernest Lawrence Rami Malek - David Hill Dane DeHaan - Kenneth Nichols Dylan Arnold - Frank Oppenheimer David Krumholtz - Isidor Isaac Rabi Alden Ehrenreich - Senate Aide Matthew Modine - Vannevar Bush Go behind the scenes with Oscar and Grammy-winning composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, who scored #Oppenheimer.

Murphy played Jonathan Crane a.k.a the villain Scarecrow in Batman Begins and reprised his role in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. He also played businessman Robert Fischer in Inception and the anonymous Shivering Soldier in Dunkirk. He is joined by English actor Emily Blunt as Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Oppenheimer - who was a German-American biologist and wife of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Blunt is best known for playing the hilarious and difficult-to-please assistant to Meryl Strep's Miranda Priestly Emily in The Devil Wears Prada. Her other notable credits include Edge of Tomorrow, The Young Victoria, Mary Poppins, A Quiet Place and The Girl On The Train. General Leslie Groves Jr. is portrayed by Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, Talented Mr Ripley, The Martian) and Lewis Strauss is depicted by Robert Downey Jnr. ( Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes). Star of Greta Gerwig's Little Women Florence Pugh plays American psychiatrist and physician - Jean Tatlock - and is also a love interest of Oppenheimer.

            "text": "Barbenheimer fans are in hysterics after spotting the profile of a woman with the 'phenomenal name' Barb Heimer. The profile of the woman was flagged on social media on what is being dubbed Barbenheimer day to mark the release of two highly anticipated films in cinemas - Barbie and Oppenheimer. People shared screenshots of the profile online with one writing: 'Huge weekend for her' while others wrote: 'Please tell me her middle name starts with an N'. Another shared a photoshopped image of a fictional Barbenheimer poster, showing the all star casts of both films with the now infamous Barb Heimer added in, while one person wrote: 'I bet she\u2019s having a fun week', and others commented how the blonde woman is 'so Barbie'. Others described the coincidence as 'absolutely incredible', 'fantastic', and said it was the mysterious Barb's 'moment', describing her name as 'phenomenal'. One wrote: 'Her time has come!' and another simply called her a 'queen' for having such a special moniker, while another said they also aspired to have the same name, writing that they were renaming themselves. Another simply congratulated her, writing: 'Congratulations on your big weekend Barb!' Oppenheimer features an all-star cast led by Cillian Murphy, who plays the theoretical physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb, J.

Amongst them were Charlie Wootton, 24, Jordan Mander, 28, Rob Corbishley, 24, clad in pink tutus and fedora hats Advertisement The hilarious coincidental name was spotted as Greta Gerwig's satire goes head-to-head in the global box office against Christopher Nolan's intense drama Oppenheimer, about the scientist who helped to create the atomic bomb. The two major titles were released simultaneously today with thousands of fans deciding to buy tickets for both shows leading to a spawning phenomenon known as Barbenheimer. Barbie sees Margot Robbie, 33, leading the cast as the eponymous Barbie doll alongside her boyfriend Ken, played by Ryan Gosling, 42. The cast is a who's who of Hollywood powerhouses, with Will Ferrell playing the CEO of Mattel, and Helen Mirren the narrator. Meanwhile Oppenheimer features an all-star cast led by Cillian Murphy, who plays the theoretical physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. The movie also boasts a stellar cast including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon. The Barbenheimer phenomenon means that the films - which are vastly different from one another - will not be competing but rather helping one another gain more ticket sales. Hundreds headed to the cinemas today for the all-day movie marathon epic to celebrate the release of the two films, dressed in pink tutus and Oppenheimer hats. Giddy fans decked head-to-toe in pink with feather boas, sunglasses and cowboy boots swarmed into theatres, with some even opting for back-to-back screenings of Barbie, Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which was released last week. Thanks to the buzz surrounding both films, Cineworld expects to enjoy its biggest weekend in terms of ticket sales for years, having already sold 200,000 in advance. The chain has branded it the biggest opening since the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame in 2019, which brought in \u00a3276m over its first weekend alone. 'The incredible buzz around Barbenheimer is what cinema and the magic of seeing films on the big screen is all about, and we're expecting this weekend to be our busiest in terms of admissions since pre-Covid,' Stuart Crane, vice-president of film for Cineworld, told the Times. Callum Bell (second from left) starred in the film and went to see the movie with his family Karen, Naomi and Thomas (left to right) Friends Reece Reidy, 23, and Beth Minpoli, 20, changed their shifts at work to be able to come and watch the first Barbie screening of the day in Leeds city centre Karol Olszewski, 23, lives in London, wore pink trousers and a pink Mean Girls t-shirt to the opening of Barbie at Leicester Square today 'Some of our cinemas have already sold out seven main evening showings for Barbie this Friday. 'Meanwhile, Oppenheimer pre-sales continue to outperform that of Dunkirk and Cineworld Imax showings for Oppenheimer have almost already sold out for this first weekend.' Meanwhile, Odeon has reported that more than 300 screenings have sold out for both films, and predicts it will sell a million tickets over the next week alone.",

The film opened worldwide in July 2023, except in Japan, where there is yet to be a scheduled release date. As the only country that has experienced nuclear-weapon attacks, the Japanese people have expressed feelings about the film. August 6 and 9 will mark 78 years since two atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

            "title": "Comedian David Baddiel criticises decision to cast Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer",
            "text": "English comedian David Baddiel has criticised the casting of the Irish actor Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan\u2019s recent biopic. English comedian and author David Baddiel has expressed concerns over Cillian Murphy\u2019s role in blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer. Baddiel wrote an opinion piece in which he criticised the casting of non-Jewish actors such as Murphy in roles as famous Jewish people, as was the case in the new historical drama epic. David Baddiel \u2013 a talented author and comedian Following the movie\u2019s release, Baddiel, who is of Jewish descent, wrote a damning article for The Jewish Chronicle titled: \u201cOppenheimer liked to pretend he wasn\u2019t Jewish \u2013 like the film\u201d. In the piece, Baddiel writes: \u201cAnother day, another film/TV show/play in which a famous Jew is played by a non-Jew. \u201cI have talked and written about this many times \u2013 about how it\u2019s a question not of acting but of context: minority casting being presently dominated by the notion of authenticity; the question is why that doesn\u2019t apply to Jews and what that means for how people see Jews. \u201cBut there is another, more complex issue thrown up by the casting in Oppenheimer. Any biopic on such a serious subject as the creation of the atomic bomb needs to delve deep into the psychological underpinnings of the narrative\u201d. Oppenheimer \u2013 one of the biggest blockbusters of 2023 Baddiel argues in his opinion piece that the movie\u2019s chief character, J Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Jewish heritage provided him with a more personal motivation to fight the threat posed by Nazi Germany by helping to develop the atomic bomb. Baddiel wrote, \u201cThe emotional undercurrent for J Robert and Albert Einstein and the other Jews involved in trying to make this weapon before the Nazis did, was fear and desperation. \u201cOppenheimer does include scenes where mentions of J Robert\u2019s heritage are present and correct, but the film lacks [\u2026] any profound sense of that ethnicity being key to who he was, the secret driver of his work at Los Alamos\u201d. Baddiel suggested that the casting of non-Jewish actors for these parts was the reason for the film\u2019s shortcomings in this area. Baddiel concluded: \u201cI\u2019ve called Oppenheimer J Robert in this article because his first name was, in fact, Julius. \u201cHe, however, insisted it stood for nothing because he didn\u2019t want people to think he was Jewish or that Jewishness mattered much to him \u2013 and there is a sense in which Oppenheimer the movie has gone along with that. But to do so is to miss, perhaps, the deepest undercurrent of the story\u201d. Cillian Murphy \u2013 one of Ireland\u2019s best actors In the new Christopher Nolan-directed movie, Cork-born Cillian Murphy plays the role of real-life theoretical physicist and \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d J Robert Oppenheimer. Starring alongside Murphy in the movie is also Tom Conti, who plays the role of fellow theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, who, like Oppenheimer, was Jewish. Baddiel criticised the fact that, unlike the characters they play, Murphy and Conti are not Jewish.",

            "title": "Oppenheimer becomes highest-grossing WWII film of all time",
            "text": "Oppenheimer has officially become the highest-grossing Second World War movie ever made. The Christopher Nolan film has sailed past the $550m mark at the global box office, and has been met with rave reviews. Released in cinemas last month, Oppenheimer is a three-hour-long biopic on the trials and tribulations of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and the invention of the atomic bomb. Much of the film concerns Oppenheimer\u2019s work at the Los Alamos wartime laboratory and his subsequent political persecution at the hands of government official Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey Jr in the movie. According to the most recent projections by Box Office Mojo, Oppenheimer surpassed the previous record-holder, Dunkirk, also made by Nolan, which raked in $527m at the global box office. The film starred Tom Hardy, Harry Styles and Murphy, and is set in the backdrop of the Dunkirk evacuation during the Battle of France. Despite impressive numbers in the war film history, Oppenheimer is lagging behind in the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d battle as Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie has generated more than $1bn in the same amount of time both films were released. In a four out of five-star review, The Independent\u2019s Clarisse Loughrey called Oppenheimer \u201cChristopher Nolan\u2019s best and most revealing work\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist\u2019s eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination. Here, Nolan treats one of the most contested legacies of the 20th century \u2013 that of J Robert Oppenheimer, the \u2018father of the atomic bomb\u2019 \u2013 as a mathematical puzzle to be solved,\u201d Loughrey wrote. In an interview with The Independent, Nolan revealed that Oppenheimer is the \u201cbiggest film I\u2019ve ever made\u201d. \u201cThe film I wanted to make couldn\u2019t have been done smaller,\u201d Nolan said of the $100m film. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s not about budget \u2013 the magnitude of the story is what attracted me to it. \u201cThe fact that Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists couldn\u2019t completely eliminate the possibility that they might set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the entire world, but still triggered the test \u2013 the idea of someone taking that risk on behalf of all of us and all our descendants. There\u2019s nothing bigger than that.\u201d Oppenheimer was released in theatres on 21 July.",

            "title": "Oppenheimer&#039;s Nuclear Explosion Effects Recreated With Impressive Accuracy By YouTuber - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "YouTuber William H Baker recreates Oppenheimer\u2018s widely discussed nuclear explosion effects with impressive accuracy. Christopher Nolan\u2019s latest production featured an all-star cast including Cillian Muphy, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and many more as key figures surrounding the Manhattan Project. Murphy starred as the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who directed the project\u2019s laboratory and played a pivotal role in constructing the first nuclear bomb during World War II. While Oppenheimer continues to dominate theaters, one YouTuber has taken it upon themselves to bring the film\u2019s spectacle home by recreating the effects used to visualize the deadly atomic blast. After carefully combing through the trailer for hints about how Nolan created Oppenheimer\u2018s chemical reactions and blast effect visuals, Baker used a combination of glitter, water, long-exposure photography, chemical mixtures, and an elaborate sphere to replicate the shots. The result is an impressive recreation of some of Oppenheimer\u2018s most visually distinct moments. How Close Did William H Baker Come To Oppenheimer\u2019s Shots? Following the announcement of Oppenheimer, there was much interest in how Nolan would recreate the scientific tests. Across his career, Nolan has built a reputation for relying heavily on practical effects where he can, whether they were rotating hallways as characters fight through them in Inception, or capturing high-flying World War II dogfights in IMAX via risky camera setups in Dunkirk. With nuclear testing featured heavily in Oppenheimer, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear how he could pull that off practically. Oppenheimer\u2018s VFX team conducted numerous real-life scientific tests to prove what physical means could be used to create distinct visuals. The methods utilized were not too removed from what Baker and friends used in their own recreations of the shots, most notably with the glowing sphere and the use of small particles in water representing the explosive chemical processes. While some VFX was ultimately used, Nolan and his team\u2019s techniques were largely practical. Related: What Christopher Nolan Really Means When He Says Oppenheimer Has \u201cNo CGI\u201d As Oppenheimer\u2018s exploration of a harrowing, world-changing moment has captured cinemagoers, many may be just as amazed with Baker\u2019s efforts. Using just research and accessible items, the YouTuber and his team have dedicated themselves to following in Nolan\u2019s creative footsteps to capture their own stunning visuals. With Baker\u2019s effects being incredibly similar to Nolan\u2019s in both method and final shots, it\u2019s clear that incredible things can be accomplished with practical effects if creative teams are willing to put in the time and effort.

            "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s historical epic \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d about the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, is preparing for a massive global debut next month. As of now, though, the film\u2019s distributor Universal has yet to announce when \u2014 or if \u2014 it will premiere in Japan. A spokesperson for the studio says \u201cplans have not been finalized in all markets.\u201d Universal is releasing the $100 million-budgeted \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world on July 21. The situation in Japan is complicated given the film\u2019s subject matter and the devastation the bombs wrought on the country. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d centers on American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), who led the efforts to build the weapons of mass destruction that ended the war. Approximately 200,000 Japanese civilians died after two atomic bombs were dropped in 1945 over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though the movie\u2019s focus may not be enough to prevent the country from playing \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in its theaters, if it does secure a release date, it\u2019s not clear that Japanese moviegoers will be interested in seeing a film about the topic. Other American-backed movies set in the Pacific theater of World War II have played in Japanese cinemas \u2014 though to mixed results. Hugh Jackman\u2019s 2013 \u201cX-Men\u201d movie \u201cThe Wolverine,\u201d which had a sequence involving the bombing of Nagasaki, generated a muted $7.9 million. Meanwhile, the Japanese-language \u201cLetters From Iwo Jima\u201d ($42.9 million), the second of Clint Eastwood\u2019s 2006 companion pieces, earned far more than \u201cFlags of Our Fathers\u201d ($13.1 million), which recounted the same battle from the American perspective. \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d sources say, differs from those films in that it is a talky R-rated drama that is largely set in laboratories and the halls of American government, not the battlefield. Whether \u201cOppenheimer\u201d will play in Japan comes down to Toho-Towa, the country\u2019s biggest distributor of Hollywood films. The company has screened the movie, but has yet to indicate if it\u2019ll take it on. There are other factors that make Japan a unique moviegoing market. Unlike most territories, Hollywood studios have influence but not the final say in when its movies will open in Japan. It\u2019s also often the last country to release Hollywood films, in part because marketing efforts are highly structured. It\u2019s not unusual for American-made movies to debut in Japan months later than they do in North America. And those plans are usually late to come together. That said, two other major tentpoles that are premiering domestically in July have already been given release dates in Japan. Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d is set for Aug. 11 and Tom Cruise\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d lands on July 21. Nolan\u2019s films, including \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d trilogy, as well as \u201cInception,\u201d \u201cInterstellar,\u201d \u201cDunkirk\u201d and \u201cTenet,\u201d tend to make a huge portion of their money at the international box office. That may not be the case with a firmly American story like \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which studio sources believe will be more popular with U.S. moviegoers than foreign crowds. Japan, one of the top moviegoing markets, has been a modest territory for Nolan\u2019s prior efforts. His two most recent releases, \u201cTenet\u201d and \u201cDunkirk,\u201d grossed $25 million and $14.8 million respectively in the country\u2019s cinemas. Nolan, who shot the movie in 70mm with Imax cameras, has stressed the importance of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d arguing that the aftershocks of the technology reverberates to this day. \u201cLike it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived,\u201d Nolan said at CinemaCon, the annual convention for movie theater owners. \u201cHe made the world that we live in for better or for worse. His story has to be seen to be believed.\u201d",

            "text": "It\u2019s a matchup for the ages, up there with Ali vs. Frazier, the Hatfields vs. the McCoys and Athens vs. Sparta. Well, let\u2019s not get carried away. But it is fair to say that with \u201cBarbie\u201d vs. \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d Hollywood has not captured the popular imagination in this way for quite some time. On Thursday night, the two wildly incongruous Hollywood megamovies arrive in theaters after weeks of internet meme-ification and questionable marketing tie-ins. (We\u2019re looking at you, Barbie-inspired Burger King sandwich topped with what looks like chewed bubble gum.) Together, the movies could generate the biggest crowds at North American multiplexes in four years, numbers not seen since before the pandemic, box office prognosticators said. \u201c\u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 are basically the perfect frenemies at the box office this weekend,\u201d said Dave Karger, the Turner Classic Movies host. \u201cYes, they\u2019re technically competitors, but they\u2019re largely going after different audiences, and the Barbenheimer hype seems only to be helping both films.\u201d Greta Gerwig\u2019s candy-coated \u201cBarbie,\u201d which cost an estimated $145 million to make, not including marketing costs, has the potential to earn $100 million in the United States and Canada through Sunday, according to analysts who track audience interest and use complex formulas to forecast box office performance. Christopher Nolan\u2019s weighty \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which cost at least $100 million before marketing, is looking at around $50 million in domestic ticket sales over the same period. Warner Bros., citing presales of about $30 million, said it was expecting closer to $75 million in weekend ticket sales for \u201cBarbie.\u201d (Studios try their darnedest to downplay expectations.) The studio has booked the PG-13 comedy onto about 4,200 screens in North America. Universal Pictures, the studio behind \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d an R-rated historical drama about the making of the atomic bomb, declined to comment. It will unfurl Nolan\u2019s film on about 3,600 domestic screens. \u201cBarbie\u201d has a run time of just under two hours. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d stretches three, limiting the number of screenings that theaters can squeeze into the weekend. \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d however, has the benefit of playing on most of North America\u2019s large-format screens, which come with a ticket surcharge of up to $12 in New York. IMAX is devoting its entire footprint to Nolan\u2019s opus for the next three weeks (to the chagrin of Tom Cruise, who hoped his \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d would continue to play on some of those screens after opening last week). AMC Entertainment, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, said on Monday that more than 40,000 people had purchased tickets to see \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d as a double feature, up from 20,000 last week. Hollywood urgently needs a weekend that exceeds \u2014 or even meets \u2014 expectations. This was the year when moviegoing was finally supposed to bounce back from the pandemic, which closed many theaters for months on end and sped the growth of streaming services in homes. At last, cinemas would reclaim a position of cultural urgency. But ticket sales in the United States and Canada for the year to date (about $5 billion) are down by about 20% from the same period in 2019, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Blips of hope, including strong sales for the innovative \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d and the hyper-violent \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4,\u201d have been blotted out by disappointing results for expensive franchise films including \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d and \u201cFast X.\u201d The latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d film arrived last weekend to solid results, but below what Hollywood had been expecting. Ticket buyers seem to be tiring of new installments in decades-old franchises. What is succeeding? For the most part, characters that have not been onscreen in recent memory (\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d), new chapters in series that are not as well worn (\u201cCreed III\u201d) and movies that cater to audiences ignored by Hollywood (\u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d which has been promoted by the political right). For all of her world domination, Barbie has never before had her own big-budget movie. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is based on the 2005 biography \u201cAmerican Prometheus\u201d by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. \u201cBoth studios went all-in on original films, directed by notable auteurs with an interest in pushing the envelope,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. \u201cThese are not the tried-and-true safe bets that are the hallmark of the summer movie season.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d has major movie stars \u2014 Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling \u2014 while \u201cOppenheimer\u201d cast the lesser-known Cillian Murphy in the title role. \u201cBarbie\u201d is aimed at women, while \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has the edge with men. One represents what many cinephiles loathe about Hollywood: movies based on toys. The other was written and directed by one of Hollywood\u2019s most serious cinephiles. Comedy against drama. The brightest side of human imagination vs. the darkest. Creating worlds, destroying worlds. The contrasts are irresistible. While rare, such box-office matchups are not without precedent. Just ask Nolan: In July 2008, his sinister Batman movie \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d (Warner Bros.) arrived head-to-head with Universal\u2019s silly, sun-drenched \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d His was No. 1 that weekend, but both movies became runaway hits.",

            "text": "The theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's life and times will be dramatised in the upcoming film Oppenheimer, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. While it is unclear if the movie will reference Oppenheimer's fascination for Hinduism and the Bhagavad Gita, a growing interest can be felt in these facets of his personality in the days leading up to Oppenheimer's release. He famously quoted the Gita (in his mind) after the Trinity test of 1945, through which he created the world's first atomic bomb. Oppenheimer seemed to understand the gravity of what he had just done, and thought to himself, \"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One\u2026 I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\u201d According to Time magazine article from 1948, Oppenheimer read the Gita for his \u2018personal delight\u2019 in the evenings, and sometimes to entertain friends while he was at Berkeley, which is where he also took lessons in Sanskrit from resident expert Arthur W Ryder. It was his eighth language. A copy of the Gita, bound in pink and held together with scotch tape, was placed in his study at Princeton. He would regularly write to his brother Frank about his fascination for the arts, after discovering the work of French writer Marcel Proust, and the works of poet John Dunne. Oppenheimer would also keep Frank updated about his studies in Sanskrit, and revealed through these letters that his knowledge about ancient Indian texts wasn't limited to the Gita, but also extended to the Meghaduta, a lyric poem written by Kalidasa, and the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. \"I have been reading the Bhagavad Gita with Ryder and two Sanskritists,\" he wrote in 1933, the same year as Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. A year later, in another letter to Frank, Oppenheimer wrote, \"Only a very long letter can make up for my great silence, and for the many sweet things for which I have to thank you, letters and benevolences stretching now over many months. Benevolences starting with the precious Meghaduta, and rather too learned Veda. The Meghaduta I read with Ryder, with great delight, some ease, and great enchantment; the Veda lies on my shelf, a reproach to my indolence.\" In a letter written in 1932, Oppenheimer referenced the Gita and drew connections between its philosophies and war. \"I believe that through discipline. we can achieve serenity. I believe that through discipline we learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances. Therefore I think that all things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war. ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude; for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace,\" he wrote. Actor Cillian Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer in the film, revealed in a recent interview that he read the Bhagavad Gita in preparation for the role, and told journalist Sucharita Tyagi that he found it 'absolutely beautiful'. The movie opens in theatres on Friday.",

            "text": "At Esquire, there\u2019s been heated debate over the right way to watch these two drastically different movies. You could space them out by a day\u2014or a weekend, certainly\u2014but to make the most of these releases, July 21 calls for a double feature. (This is serious enough that you should unashamedly take PTO on Friday, guys. I sure am!) The question is: Barbie first, or Oppenheimer? The most important thing isn\u2019t the order in which you see the movies\u2014it\u2019s how you curate your moviegoing experience. Whatever your schedule is this weekend, make sure it includes both movies, of course, but also a day built around the cinema. If you need some inspiration on how to get that done, this is how the Esquire editors are celebrating Barbenheimer day. Good luck out there.\u2014Trishna Rikhy, Associate Style Commerce Editor The Speedrun If you\u2019re screening Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, get ready for A LOT of movie. The combined runtime for both films reaches nearly five hours, and I\u2019m not sure if this double feature deserves my entire day. Still, I have to be aware of what they\u2019re both about, if I\u2019m going to stay in the know\u2014for my job and my social standing! So, if you must see both movies on the same day, I recommend this insane plan: Buy a ticket to Oppenheimer and watch the first hour. Then, buy a ticket to Barbie, leave Oppenheimer to watch all of Barbie, then return to Oppenheimer to catch the last act. Sure, that\u2019s a lot of missed Oppenheimer plot. But you\u2019ll still get the gist. Oppenheimer is like AIR, but for bombs. Barbie? Now that adventure could go anywhere. Plus, you get a whole two hours back! Hell, you could even see a third movie. (Perhaps Mission Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One?)\u2014Josh Rosenberg, Assistant Editor The All-Inclusive Experience Ever since the release dates for Barbie and Oppenheimer were announced, my best friend and I have been getting our itinerary for July 21 down to a science. We put more effort into planning our perfect Barbenheimer day than we\u2019ve put into\u2026 anything else, ever. (I generously posted our schedule on Twitter for people to replicate, and the Barbenheimer-planning trend went viral. That\u2019s how you know my formula is perfect.) The key to building the ultimate Barbenheimer schedule is to make it a whole production\u2014you aren\u2019t just seeing two movies. You\u2019re entering two experiences. Christopher Nolan and Greta Gerwig will bring different vibes to the big screen, and you need to immerse yourself fully into each film to get the best of both worlds. That said, there is absolutely a right way and a wrong way to go about your itinerary. We juggled with our options for a while\u2014we could start the day off strong with Barbie and then finish on a solemn note with Oppenheimer. Ultimately, we realized the golden truth: whichever movie you\u2019re looking forward to more, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014you need to start with Oppenheimer and end with Barbie. The double-feature day will start in the morning\u2014we wake up, have a gritty breakfast of black coffee, a cigarette, and maybe some plain oats. War food, baby! We\u2019re going to catch a showing of Oppenheimer around 11 A.M.\u2014the movie is roughly three hours, so timed right, we\u2019ll be out just in time to make the last brunch seating at most restaurants. At brunch, we\u2019re getting fully into Barbie mode. Mimosas for the table, dessert, the works! For the optimal Barbie viewing experience, we want to be at least a little bit tipsy (it\u2019ll be more fun!), so we\u2019re grabbing some cocktails before the evening showing of Barbie around 5 or 6 P.M.. When that\u2019s done, it\u2019s dinner, drinks, and a debrief before we hit the club to request Ryan Gosling\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken.\u201d\u2014T.R.",

            "title": "Christopher Nolan&#8217;s Oppenheimer is worth the wait, but is also lengthy and intense",
            "text": "the time the 'exclusive screening' of Christopher Nolan's much-anticipated newest movie Oppenheimer held by Universal Pictures at Mumbai's PVR Pheonix started around 10.15 pm on Wednesday, most of the film-lovers present in the auditorium had already waited for close to three hours. The screening, which was initially delayed by one hour due to the stormy weather in Mumbai, couldn't start for another two hours due to some technical problem. When the film's title Oppenheimer finally appeared on the impressive IMAX screen, it was greeted with a round of applause, albeit brief. Yet, that spontaneous response from the audience, which moments ago complained about the unexpected long-wait, was a testament to the global fan-following that Nolan enjoys. The film is a cinematic retelling of the story of genius scientist Robert Oppenheimer (essayed by Cillian Murphy), known as the father of the atomic bomb. In the run-up to its release on July 21, Oppenheimer had created an incredible buzz worldwide. Its clash with Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie, which also releases on the same date, seems to have further intensified that buzz. The battle of the two Hollywood biggies, dubbed as 'Barbenheimer', has witnessed massive booking in theatres in India. That's something to cheer about. It dispels the post-pandemic gloom that those in movie business have been dealing with. Oppenheimer is based on the Pulitzer-winning book, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. It is adapted for screen by Nolan, who is universally acknowledged as one of the passionate filmmakers with propensity for brain-twisters, immersive storytelling, grand scale and spectacle. In his career spanning nearly two-and-a-half decades, this is the first time Nolan has directed a biopic. At CinemaCon earlier this year, Nolan described Oppenheimer as the \u201cmost important person who ever lived. He made the world we live in, for better or for worse.\u201d The film closely follows the scientist, with the camera mostly focusing on the lean and pipe-smoking Murphy as the narrative explores Oppenheimer's brilliance, ambitions, vulnerabilities and conflicts. Murphy is ably supported by the cast of remarkable actors including Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek. Many have already declared Oppenheimer as Nolan's best work so far and the movie as one of the best of this decade. While the film is engrossing, it can be challenging for the viewers. It is lengthy and intense. It does not take the easy way out of explaining everything. Some amount of familiarity with Oppenheimer's work and the troubles he went through after the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, might be helpful. When the audience at the Mumbai screening walked out of the auditorium close to 1.20 am, they seemed to have given the big-screen spectacle \u2013 already emerged as Nolan's highest-rated film on all time on Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 a thumbs-up. In their excitement of watching the blockbusters before its theatrical release, they seemed to have set aside their concerns regarding the rains or finding a transport to return home.",

            "title": "The Real TIME Magazine Covers Featured in <i>Oppenheimer</i>",
            "text": "This post contains spoilers for Oppenheimer. TIME makes a cameo in the summer blockbuster Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s movie about brainiac theoretical physicist and atomic bomb architect J. Robert Oppenheimer. Two TIME magazine covers show up in the movie: one featuring Oppenheimer, and the other depicting his nemesis Lewis Strauss, head of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While based on real issues of the magazine, the cover photos in the film are altered to look like the actors Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The first TIME magazine that appears in the movie is the Nov. 8, 1948, issue, featuring a portrait of Oppenheimer by the artist Ernest Hamlin Baker. The cover story details the scientist\u2019s rise to fame, and includes details about Oppenheimer\u2019s\u2014or \u201cOppie\u2019s\u201d\u2014eccentricities: The second issue of TIME in the movie appears at a key plot point, during the feud between Oppenheimer and Strauss, who stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance. During his confirmation hearings for Commerce Secretary in 1959, Strauss is depicted in the movie as bandying about TIME\u2019s June 15, 1959, issue, bragging to an aide that he knows TIME publisher Henry Luce and got the story placed as part of his campaign for the Commerce position. The real TIME cover story explains Strauss\u2019 complicated personality that Nolan also explores in the movie: Strauss\u2019s hopes that a TIME story would boost his chances of confirmation didn\u2019t work; the Senate did not confirm him to be Commerce Secretary.

            "title": "Will Oppenheimer get a theatrical release in Japan as controversy over Barbenheimer memes erupt?",
            "text": "As the release date for Christopher Nolan\u2019s new epic Oppenheimer approaches, rumours have begun circulating that the film is banned in Japan. Oppenheimer follows the life of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer who developed the first nuclear bomb for the top-secret Manhattan Project. Nuclear weaponry was, of course, used to reap death and destruction on Japan during the Pacific War in 1945. The USA detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, killing approximately 200,000 people, most of whom were civilians. It remains the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. Oppenheimer does not yet have a theatrical release date for Japan, leading some to speculate that the film has been banned in that territory. However, this theory has been debunked. A spokesperson for Universal Pictures told Variety in June that \u201cplans have not been finalised in all markets\u201d. The studio did not immediately respond to The Independent\u2019s request for comment. Since the film\u2019s premiere screenings over the last couple of weeks, Nolan has said people are leaving cinemas \u201cdevastated\u201d. \u201cIt is an intense experience because it\u2019s an intense story. I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it\u2019s kind of a horror movie. I don\u2019t disagree,\u201d he said. Kai Bird, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who co-authored American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer on which Nolan\u2019s film is based, said in a recent academic talk: \u201cI am, at the moment, stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen [Oppenheimer].\u201d \u201cLike it or not, J Robert Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived,\u201d Nolan said at CinemaCon, the annual convention for cinema owners, earlier this year. \u201cHe made the world that we live in for better or for worse. His story has to be seen to be believed.\u201d A Change.org petition has also been kicked off demanding that Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studios behind the Oppenheimer biopic, call a halt to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hashtag in Japan. The petition has collected more than 16,000 signatures over three days. Coincidentally, Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, which is released on the same day as Oppenheimer, has been banned in Vietnam over a controversial depiction of the South China Sea. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, reportedly contains a scene depicting a map showing what appears to be the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d. The line is a representation of China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, which Vietnam says violates its sovereignty. China and Vietnam have long been in a stand-off over the region, while Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia all make claims to parts of the sea. In a statement to Variety, Warner Bros said the \u201cdoodles\u201d shown were intended to depict \u201cBarbie\u2019s make-believe journey from Barbie Land\u201d. \u201cThe map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing,\u201d a spokesperson said. They added that it \u201cwas not intended to make any type of statement\u201d. Oppenheimer is released in cinemas on 21 July.",

            "title": "Pat Stacey\u2019s TV review: Terrific Oppenheimer miniseries gets a welcome BBC reshowing",
            "text": "Goodchild, who was interviewed by Variety last month to coincide with the film\u2019s release, started his BBC producing career in radio drama and later moved to television with the science documentary series Horizon. When Horizon diversified into science docudramas in the 1970s, Goodchild, who holds a chemistry degree, got to combine his two interests in a successful series about Marie Curie. The supporting cast was made up almost entirely of American actors based in Britain. It was his idea to make a seven-part miniseries about J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, played by Waterston. First shown on BBC2 in 1980, Oppenheimer was a big hit with viewers and critics, winning three Bafta awards. It also garnered Emmy and Golden Globe nominations after it was shown on PBS in the United States. The budget of \u00a31.5m (about \u20ac7.5m today) \u2013 90pc of it coming from the BBC, the rest from WGBH Boston \u2013 might seem like a grain of New Mexico sand compared with the \u00a3100m price tag of Nolan\u2019s Imax epic. Back then, however, it was a huge spend for a British drama. A huge physical production, too, with scrupulous attention to detail. For maximum authenticity, Goodchild, now 83, told Variety, the Manhattan Project\u2019s Los Alamos Laboratory was recreated on a purpose-built set in Colorado Springs, complete with water tower and replica bomb. One million film goers expected as Barbenheimer released The supporting cast was made up almost entirely of American actors based in Britain. Two notable exceptions were future Poirot star David Suchet as the excitable, voluble Hungarian physicist Edward Teller and Edward Hardwicke (Dr Watson to Jeremy Brett\u2019s Sherlock Holmes) as his Italian colleague Enrico Fermi. Viewers who have grown used to watching even modestly budgeted dramas shot on HD video that mimics celluloid film may find the switch from Oppenheimer\u2019s interior scenes, which were mostly shot on videotape in a studio in the UK, to the ones shot on film in America a little jarring at first. But the story is so engrossing you cease to be aware of the contrast after a while. What\u2019s remarkable is how well Oppenheimer, which was written by Peter Prince and directed by Barry Davis, holds up 43 years later. There\u2019s none of the slowness or staginess you sometimes see in dramas from the period. Friday\u2019s opening two episodes positively zipped by. He conveys Oppenheimer\u2019s charisma, intelligence, brilliance and charm, especially to women. They spanned the years 1938, when Oppenheimer was at the University of Berkley, to 1942, when Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Manning Redwood), ignoring warnings about Oppenheimer\u2019s long associations with active communists and championing of left-wing causes, put him in charge of the Manhattan Project, which was to be housed in a high-security facility in Los Alamos. Waterston, just four years ahead of his best actor Oscar nomination for playing Siydney Schanberg in The Killing Fields, is fantastic as Oppenheimer. You can see why the BBC was prepared to pay him well above the normal rate for appearing in one of its dramas and to put him up in a luxury hotel during filming. He conveys Oppenheimer\u2019s charisma, intelligence, brilliance and charm, especially to women. But we also see his ruthlessness and arrogance. When we meet him, he\u2019s romantically involved with psychiatrist and communist Jean Tatlock (Kate Harper), who suffered from clinical depression (she died by suicide in 1944), yet thinks nothing of casting her aside when he sets eyes on his future wife Kitty Puening (Jana Shelden), who at that time is married to someone else. They tumble into an affair. In one particularly cruel moment, he humiliates Jean by turning up at a dinner party at her home with Kitty on his arm. Even at this stage, the seeds of Oppenheimer\u2019s downfall are being sown. Naively unconcerned about the dangers of having communist friends, he doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s already under FBI surveillance. A terrific drama from a far more creative age of TV.",

Soap fans will recall that Guy, 40, played the legendary Craig Dean in the popular Channel 4 soap from 2002 until 2008, where he was part of several hard-hitting storylines. One of Craig's biggest storylines was when he started questioning his sexuality and later fell in love with John Paul McQueen with the two characters embarking in an on-off romance. Since leaving the Chester-based soap in 2008, actor Guy has gone on to have a successful Hollywood career with appearances in films such as Pitch Perfect 3, where he played Theo in the 2017 blockbuster, which also stars A-listers Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow. The actor has also appeared in hit TV series Ray Donovan, The Affair and Counterpart. Guy's most recent project has seen him join the star-studded cast of Oppenheimer, which was released in cinemas on 21 July 2023 in the UK. Guy plays George Eltenton in the movie and he stars alongside the likes of Hollywood stars Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer viewers were left stunned to see Guy in the movie, as he is best known for his role as Craig in Hollyoaks, taking to Twitter one person said: \"I have lots of thoughts on Oppenheimer, and how extraordinary, and epic and chilling it is, and the power of cinema to bring unimaginable things to life, but can we also address the fact that Craig Dean from Hollyoaks is in it?\" a different account put: \"Was I the only one who didn't know Craig Dean was in Oppenheimer\" with another writing: \"Oppenheimer is absolutely breathtaking and, hopefully, the beginning of Craig from Hollyoaks\u2019 renaissance.\" Elsewhere, a different person said: \"I'm still reeling from Craig from Hollyoaks being in Oppenheimer\", another follower wrote: \"Craig from Hollyoaks is in OPPENHEIMER and I\u2019m just finding this out *today*???\" another person put: \"Thought I spotted Craig Dean from @Hollyoaks when I watched Oppenheimer earlier today. Just checked the cast list & it is him! Amazing achievement! Hollyoaks to Hollywood\" while a different account added: \"How did no one mention that Craig Dean from Hollyoaks has a cameo in Oppenheimer?\" * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.",

            "text": "\u201cCharming one moment, caustic the next\u201d, even in his late 30s \u201che carried the markings of a spoiled, impetuous rich kid whose depressive behaviour occasionally swung toward the erratic\u201d, said The New York Times. While studying at Cambridge he confessed to putting a poisoned apple on his tutor\u2019s desk and as a young professor in California he crashed his car while racing a train. It was during this period that he met and began an affair with Jean Tatlock, a committed Communist Party member who introduced him to left-wing politics and a radical set of \u201cfellow travellers\u201d \u2013 associations that would have devastating consequences for Oppenheimer in the years to come. The relationship was tempestous and did not last, however, and in 1940 he married Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Puening, a biologist and former communist, with whom he had two children. Becoming \u2018the father of the atomic bomb\u2019 Appointed in 1942 to lead the scientific work of the Manhattan Project \u2013 tasked with developing the atomic bomb \u2013 Oppenheimer was considered a \u201cbizarre choice\u201d, said Shapin in The Guardian. There was nothing in his background to indicate that he had the ability to lead such a mammoth undertaking. Shapin wrote that \u201che was temperamentally volatile, patronising and inept in his social relations, and thoroughly impractical\u201d. However, at Los Alamos in New Mexico, where the bomb was designed and assembled, \u201che rapidly metamorphosed into a marvellously efficient and charismatic administrator\u201d. General Leslie Groves, who appointed Oppenheimer to run the project, may have also seen in him \u201ca man driven far less by ideology than by ambition, whose need to be an important player ensured that anything he directed would be a success\u201d, said The New York Times. On 16 July 1945 the first atomic bomb successfully detonated in New Mexico, and it was followed just a few weeks later by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. A complicated legacy Lionised by the public as the brains behind the bomb, Oppenheimer became a household name in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War and probably the most famous scientist in the world. Yet continued suspicion over his communist associations in the 1930s, his support for the idea of a world government to regulate atomic weapons and opposition to the development the more powerful Hydrogen bomb made Oppenheimer an easy target for his political enemies and scientific rivals during the McCarthyite \u201cRed Scare\u201d witch-hunts of the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1954, the US Atomic Energy Commission revoked Oppenheimer\u2019s security clearance over questions around his loyalty. A controversial decision even at the time, it was formally nullified in 2022 by the US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, who said: \u201cAs time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.\u201d He died of throat cancer at the age of 62 in 1967. His public torment about the devastation his invention caused, his hope it might make war obsolete and his own contradictions that brought about his political disgrace and downfall, \u201chave marked him in the eyes of some as all the more heroic, a visionary persecuted by warmongering McCarthyite troglodytes\u201d, said The New Atlantis. \u201cHis legacy, of course, is far more complicated.\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is released in the UK on 21 July and is based on the 2005 biography \u201cAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer\u201d by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.",

            "text": "What happens when two of the most anticipated films of 2023 debut in the same week? A fan-made movie crossover event known as Barbenheimer. Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Dua Lipa, and Issa Rae, among several others, will release on July 21. Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s film on J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was integral to the development of the atomic bomb, comes out the same day. Summer movie-goers are relishing the chance to celebrate a one-day cinematic experience of watching two polar-opposite films back-to-back. Hollywood is all about Barbenheimer Tom Cruise, star of this summer\u2019s other blockbuster, Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning, will be taking part in the phenomenon. \u201c\u200b\u200bI love a double feature, and it doesn\u2019t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie,\u201d he tweeted in late June. Cruise told the Sydney Morning Herald he plans to see Oppenheimer first and then Barbie opening weekend. Read More: How Barbie Came to Life The filmmakers and actors from both films are in on the fun, playfully leaning into the crowded film lineup to encourage more people to the movies. Gerwig and Robbie joined in, buying tickets to Oppenheimer, as well as the new Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones movies. Both Nolan and leading-man Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer have addressed the frenzy, with Nolan telling IGN, \u201cI think for those of us who care about movies, we\u2019ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it\u2019s here and that\u2019s terrific.\u201d Planning the ideal Barbenheimer day Maria Carrillo, 22, will take part in Barbenheimer with her friends because it will be a theatrical release unlike any other since COVID-19 began in 2020, as movie-going is only now beginning to get back to pre-pandemic levels. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved going to the movies and this is going to be fun,\u201d she tells TIME. Carrillo and countless others online are excited about making the collaboration happen, creating special merchandise and self-made trailers and giving advice on how to affordably watching both films in theaters or craft the perfect Barbenheimer viewing itinerary (which can include everything from mimosas to showers and ice coffees to whiskey at Japanese listening bar and an outfit change). Businesses have gotten in on it\u2014a Barnes & Nobles in Olympia, Washington posted a TikTok with over 30,000 likes of a \u201cBarbeinheimer Starter Pack.\u201d According to Elizabeth Frank, AMC\u2019s CCO and executive VP of worldwide programming, over 20,000 tickets have been sold so far at AMC Theaters to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day. One debate will continue until July 21: in what order should viewers see the movies? One TikToker says she will not be starting with Barbie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry do you also eat dessert first? Oppenheimer first, then Barbie it\u2019s science,\u201d she captioned her video. Others disagree: \u201cPeople seeing Barbie first are wild,\u201d one person tweeted, offering their preferred schedule. Carrillo plans to watch Oppenheimer first on July 21. \u201cIt makes more sense because it\u2019s a really heavy movie,\u201d she says. Following Oppenheimer, Carrillo and her friends will change outfits and have a debrief dinner before ending \u201cthe night with Barbie as a treat, which will be beautiful and pink.\u201d She anticipates both films will live up to their expectations. For now, she\u2019s enjoying the once-in-a-lifetime blockbuster scenario and everything it has brought. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the fun.\u201d Write to Mariah Espada at mariah.espada@time.com.",

            "text": "Florence Pugh stepped in to save Emily Blunt from a possible wardrobe malfunction at the Oppenheimer photocall in London. The Oppenheimer cast was posing for photos in Trafalgar Square on Wednesday 12 July when Pugh came to Blunt\u2019s rescue after her jacket appeared to come loose. The Devil Wears Prada star attended the photocall while sporting a gold, metallic suit with black buttons. As for the Don\u2019t Worry Darling actor, Pugh arrived at the Oppenheimer photocall in a blue Moschino shirt dress with a deep, plunging neckline. According to the DailyMail, the Mary Poppins star\u2019s gold jacket popped open in front of cameras, prompting Pugh to rush over and cover her pal\u2019s suit. In photos from the red carpet, the pair could be seen giggling about the near-wardrobe malfunction as Pugh helped hold Blunt\u2019s jacket closed. Meanwhile, fans praised Pugh for lending Blunt a helping hand and gushed over the pair\u2019s friendship. \u201cFlorence Pugh is a real one for protecting Emily Blunt from a wardrobe malfunction,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cThey\u2019re sooo cute together,\u201d another said, while someone else wrote: \u201cLiterally my worlds colliding\u201d In Oppenheimer, which hits theatres on 21 July, Emily Blunt stars as Kitty Oppenheimer, the wife of physicist J Robert Oppenheimer \u2013 played by Cillian Murphy in the Christopher Nolan film. The Irish actor, 47, leads the highly-anticipated biographical drama as \u201cthe father of the atomic bomb,\u201d whose World War II invention changed the nature of war forever. Florence Pugh, 27, portrays physician Jean Tatlock, who was known for her romantic relationship with Oppenheimer. However, fans recently came to Murphy and Pugh\u2019s defense when people began \u201cgriping about the age gap\u201d between the co-stars. As critics condemned the 20-year age gap between the two actors, many people pointed out that \u201cTatlock was 22 years old when she started dating Oppenheimer and 29 when she died\u201d. \u201cThe on-screen age gap discourse is very valid but this isn\u2019t the film for it because Oppenheimer & Tatlock had a 10-year age gap,\u201d another agreed. \u201cSo Cillian & Florence Pugh are perfect casting.\u201d As for Blunt, the 40-year-old actor recently revealed that she will be taking a break from acting to spend more time with her two daughters, who she shares with husband John Krasinski. Blunt opened up about her decision to take a brief hiatus on a recent episode of iHeart\u2019s Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi podcast. \u201cThis year, I\u2019m not working. I worked quite a bit last year and my oldest baby is nine, so we\u2019re in the last year of single digits,\u201d the British actor explained. \u201cAnd I just feel [like] there are cornerstones to their day that are so important when they\u2019re little.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s: \u2018Will you wake me up? Will you take me to school? Will you pick me up? Will you put me to bed?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I just need to be there for all of them for a good stretch. And I just felt that in my bones.\u201d In addition to Murphy, Blunt, and Pugh, Oppenheimer also features a star-studded cast of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh, Matthew Modine, and Casey Affleck.",

            "text": "Oppenheimer may have been na\u00efve, but he was right to fight the charges \u2014 and right to use his influence as one of the country\u2019s pre-eminent scientists to speak out against a nuclear arms race. In the months and years leading up to the security hearing, Oppenheimer had criticized the decision to build a \u201csuper\u201d hydrogen bomb. Astonishingly, he had gone so far as to say that the Hiroshima bomb was used \u201cagainst an essentially defeated enemy.\u201d The atomic bomb, he warned, \u201cis a weapon for aggressors, and the elements of surprise and terror are as intrinsic to it as are the fissionable nuclei.\u201d These forthright dissents against the prevailing view of Washington\u2019s national security establishment earned him powerful political enemies. That was precisely why he was being charged with disloyalty. It is my hope that Christopher Nolan\u2019s stunning new film on Oppenheimer\u2019s complicated legacy will initiate a national conversation not only about our existential relationship to weapons of mass destruction, but also the need in our society for scientists as public intellectuals. Mr. Nolan\u2019s three-hour film is a riveting thriller and mystery story that delves deeply into what this country did to its most famous scientist. Sadly, Oppenheimer\u2019s life story is relevant to our current political predicaments. Oppenheimer was destroyed by a political movement characterized by rank know-nothing, anti-intellectual, xenophobic demagogues. The witch-hunters of that season are the direct ancestors of our current political actors of a certain paranoid style. I\u2019m thinking of Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s chief counsel, who tried to subpoena Oppenheimer in 1954, only to be warned that this could interfere with the impending security hearing against Oppenheimer. Yes, that Roy Cohn, who taught former President Donald Trump his brash, wholly deranged style of politics. Just recall the former president\u2019s fact-challenged comments on the pandemic or climate change. This is a worldview proudly scornful of science. After America\u2019s most celebrated scientist was falsely accused and publicly humiliated, the Oppenheimer case sent a warning to all scientists not to stand up in the political arena as public intellectuals. This was the real tragedy of Oppenheimer. What happened to him also damaged our ability as a society to debate honestly about scientific theory \u2014 the very foundation of our modern world. Quantum physics has utterly transformed our understanding of the universe. And this science has also given us a revolution in computing power and incredible biomedical innovations to prolong human life. Yet, too many of our citizens still distrust scientists and fail to understand the scientific quest, the trial and error inherent in testing any theory against facts by experimenting. Just look at what happened to our public health civil servants during the recent pandemic.",

I know what you mean and part of that is because a big blockbuster is blasting into theaters this weekend.

Cillian Murphy: \u201cWhen I\u2019m in it, I\u2019m just in it.\u201d In fact, Cillian would get so into it, he tells Deco he wouldn\u2019t even wind down after a long day of filming! Cillian Murphy: \u201cI don\u2019t really do that during the body of the movie.

            "text": "This week, two Hollywood films of completely different genres and target audiences will be clashing at the box office across the world. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy in the lead, and Greta Gerwig Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are in a race to woo audiences into theatres. While Oppenheimer has sold 90,000 tickets for day one, Barbie is trailing with 16,000. As per journalist Himesh Mankad's social media post, Oppenheimer has sold 90,000 tickets across three multiple-screen chains of PVR, INOX and Cinepolis for the opening day alone. Barbie, which opened advance bookings in India several days after Oppenheimer, has sold 16,000 tickets for its first day. Recently, during an interview with Sucharita Tyagi, Cillian revealed that he read the Bhagavad Gita before playing the role of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer famously said that he thought of a quote from the Gita in the immediate aftermath of successfully testing the world\u2019s first atomic bomb in 1945. When the test concluded successfully, Oppenheimer, who was also a student of Sanskrit, thought, \u201cNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\u201d Cillian said, \u201cI did read the Bhagavad Gita in preparation, and I thought it was an absolutely beautiful text, very inspiring. I think it was a consolation to him, he kind of needed it and it provided him a lot of consolation, all his life.\u201d When asked his learnings from Bhagavad Gita, Cillian joked, \u201cWell don\u2019t grill me on it!\u201d The actor then added, \u201cI just found it very beautiful.\u201d The film also stars Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh, is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J Sherwin. Barbie stars Margot Robbie as the titular doll, and Ryan Gosling as Ken. In the US, Barbie is expected to handily outperform Oppenheimer in its opening weekend, owing to its wider appeal.",

            "text": "Writer and filmmaker Paul Schrader has described Oppenheimer as the \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cmost important film of this century\u201d. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows the life of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who spearheaded the development of the first nuclear bomb. Schrader, 76, is best known as the writer of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver and for directing films such as First Reformed (2017) and The Card Counter (2021). He attended the New York premiere of Oppenheimer this week, sharing his thoughts on the film in a Facebook post afterwards. \u201cOPPENHEIMER. The best, most important film of this century,\u201d Schrader wrote. \u201cIf you see one film in cinemas this year it should be Oppenheimer. \u201cI\u2019m not a Nolan groupie but this one blows the door off the hinges.\u201d The film features Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) as Oppenheimer himself, while a star-studded supporting cast includes Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, and Gary Oldman. In a recent roundtable interview with his Oppenheimer castmates, Damon revealed that he had intended to take a break from acting before Nolan got in contact about the project. \u201cThis is going to sound made up, but it\u2019s actually true,\u201d he said. \u201cI had \u2013 not to get too personal \u2013 negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off. I had been in Interstellar, and then Chris put me on ice for a couple of movies, so I wasn\u2019t in the rotation.\u201d Damon previously worked with Nolan in the 2014 sci-fi film Interstellar, though did not feature in his subsequent projects Dunkirk (2017) and Tenet (2020). \u201cBut I actually negotiated in couples therapy -\u2013 this is a true story \u2013 the one caveat to my taking time off was if Chris Nolan called,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is without knowing whether or not he was working on anything, because he never tells you. He just calls you out of the blue. And so, it was a moment in my household.\u201d Murphy has also worked with Nolan previously, on films such as Batman Begins, Inception and Dunkirk. In an interview with The Independent ahead of Oppenheimer\u2019s release, Murphy also responded to filmmaker Danny Boyle\u2019s recent claim that a second sequel to 2002 horror hit 28 Days Later could be in the works. Oppenheimer is out in cinemas on 21 July.",

            "title": "An Irish Actor Playing Oppenheimer Proves Once Again That Jews Don't Count | Opinion",
            "text": "J. Robert Oppenheimer was one of the world's most famous theoretical physicists and the credited father of the atomic bomb. He was also Jewish, born to two Jewish parents. His mother, Ella, was an artist from New York; his father, Julius, emigrated as a teen from Germany to the United States in the late 1800's, fleeing the rampant antisemitism pervading Europe. Julius was penniless when arriving stateside, but soon grew to prominence in the textile industry. Like many Jewish immigrants, survival mode meant assimilation into mainstream American life. To wit, Oppenheimer's adolescence consisted of prep schools and French impressionist paintings and a tony apartment address on Riverside Drive.Oppenheimer was raised a secular Jew, and much has been made of the strain of internalized shame and self-hatred that ran throughout the course of the scientist's life. Oppenheimer was noted for denying his Jewishness, despite the fact (or maybe because of it) that he encountered antisemitism at almost every turn, facing discrimination at Harvard, the University of G\u00f6ttingen and U.C. Berkeley, where after lobbying faculty head Raymond Birge to hire fellow scientist Robert Serber, he was told \"one Jew in the department was enough.\"But in \"Oppenheimer,\" Christopher Nolan's hotly-anticipated biopic opening today, one Jew was one too many. The titular character is played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who was raised Catholic. And this was no accident. In an interview with the New York Times, Nolan admitted he wrote the film with Murphy specifically in mind. In other words, no Jewish actors were considered for the role.When it comes to casting, should it matter that Oppenheimer was a non-observant Jew, a Jew who essentially denounced his Jewish identity? It should not. Judaism is an ethnoreligion. We are a religion, we are a people, we are an ethnicity. Jews originated in the Levant. There are varying degrees of religious observance. But when it comes to one's ethnic identity, there is no litmus test for how Jewish one is.Oppenheimer may not have ascribed to Jewish traditions, he may not have attended synagogue, he may have eaten ham sandwiches. But ethnically and genetically, he was very much still a Jew. One could even argue that it's because Oppenheimer was in a perpetual state of identity crisis, constantly wrestling with the fact of his Jewishness, that a far more authentic representation of him onscreen can only be achieved through casting a Jewish actor in the role. But this does not seem to have occurred to Nolan.But this is par for the course in today's entertainment industry. And the casting of Murphy as Oppenheimer is yet another glaring example of how the collective Hollywood push for diversity, equity and inclusion when it comes to on-screen representation has almost entirely eluded the Jewish community. From \"The Marvelous Mrs Maisel,\" in which non-Jewish actor Rachel Brosnahan played Jewish comedian Miriam for the series' five-season run (and won an Emmy for doing so) to Bradley Cooper's upcoming Leonard Bernstein biopic, which Cooper directs and in which he stars as the famed Jewish composer (with the aid of a prosthetic nose), Jews are rarely cast in the roles of prominent Jewish characters.At a time wherein rates of antisemitism continue to climb\u2014per the FBI, Jews are the target of more hate crimes in America than any other ethnoreligious group\u2014Nolan's casting choice sends a very clear signal that, to filch a phrase from best-selling British author and comedian David Baddiel, \"Jews do not count.\"This does not hold true for most other ethnic and racial communities. Rightly so, the entertainment industry has made a concerted effort to cast Asian actors as Asian characters, to cast Black actors in the roles of Black characters and Latino actors as Latino characters. Hollywood has worked to increase gender equity and the representation of differently-abled individuals in film and TV. The Academy for Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has set forth rules for Oscar best picture eligibility that demand the inclusion of actors from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. These are all necessary and crucially important systemic changes to the industry at large.Jews are left out of that equation.Does this mean Murphy is not a gifted actor? On the contrary\u2014he is arguably one of today's brightest talents, earning a 2023 BAFTA nominee for his role on Netflix's gangster drama, \"Peaky Blinders\" and starring in such critical hits as \"28 Days Later\" and Nolan's 2010 sci-fi action film \"Inception.\" He can, and does, play any number of meaty, enticing, thought-provoking roles. But he is not Jewish. And no costume, hat or accent changes that truth.If Hollywood continues its robust commitment to diversity\u2014and it absolutely should\u2014then it needs to acknowledge Jewish people are an ethnicity. We are a people, we are a nationality, with a lineage that can be traced back to a very specific geographic location in the world. And, as is the case with every other ethnic minority portrayed in TV and film, Jews deserve real, nuanced, accurate representation. Otherwise, Hollywood's myriad endeavors in the diversity equity and inclusion space is a mere exercise in hypocrisy.Ultimately, casting non-Jews in the roles of Jews reduces the relatability and believability of a performance, not only for Jewish audiences but for anybody who values the importance of authenticity in cinema.Malina Saval is the Editor in Chief of Pasadena Magazine and the author of The Secret Lives of Boys: Inside the Raw, Emotional World of Male Teens.

            "title": "With Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan heard you &#8212; and finally went woke",
            "text": "All art aspires to the condition of music, according to 19th-century literary critic Aesthete Walter Pater. It means that every art form \u2013 prose, poetry, film, theatre, dance, visual art \u2013 aims to achieve music\u2019s spontaneous influx of emotion, every second of a song. I find an example around the midpoint of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s 1969 novel about a time-travelling war veteran, when he\u2019s watching a documentary about planes dropping bombs during World War II. The footage is played backwards in the scene, showing \u201cbullets and shell fragments\u201d flying back into plane hangars, a \u201cmiraculous magnetism\u201d sucking bombs and explosive clouds into the \u201cbellies of the plane\u201d. The painful momentum of the sentences accelerates to a tragic crescendo before the veteran leaves his house to look for time-travelling abilities, hoping to forget all about war. Such musical continuity hums through Christopher Nolan\u2019s latest, Oppenheimer, a biopic of the Jewish American scientist who invented the atom bomb dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending World War II. The film opens with a soundtrack that seems never to stop, marching from scene to scene towards an inevitable end with nary a scale change. The story starts with Cillian Murphy\u2019s gaunt face, held weakly in place by skeletal fingers, as he\u2019s trying to live a life in the world he\u2019s just changed forever. That is the primary concern of the film: The nightmare of Dr Robert J Oppenheimer, a modern-day Prometheus, a man who managed to do the impossible and steal fire from the gods, forever damned for it. Such a protagonist isn\u2019t fallow territory for Nolan. His filmography is littered with male protagonists on seemingly impossible quests that will forever change the world. Tenet featured a CIA agent\u2019s attempt to time-travel and prevent World War III. Interstellar featured Cooper\u2019s travels through a wormhole to find a planet for Earthly habitation. Inception was led by Cobb\u2019s sci-fi spy mission to convince a man he wants to dissolve his father\u2019s multi-national business. But Oppenheimer does display a growth in Nolan\u2019s writing skills \u2013 for one, the women surrounding the protagonist do more than offer him motivation for a quest. For example, in Interstellar, Murph\u2019s primary motivation for getting into science and looking for a way to save Earth is so that she can bring back her father. In the same movie, Amelia Brand is the daughter of a famous male scientist who spearheads the space programme and is driven to the ends of the galaxy \u2013 literally \u2013 to reach the male astronaut she\u2019s in love with. Inception featured the violent death of Cobb\u2019s mentally ill wife, which kickstarts his quest to reunite with his children. She\u2019s just a figment of his imagination for most of the movie. The Prestige\u2019s magician protagonists are always mourning the death of a woman or flirting with another. Memento\u2019s protagonist is out to avenge the death of his murdered wife. Women in Nolan's films have always been useful for the men to grow and mature, sidelined once the ordeal is done. They serve as collateral damage for the men\u2019s all-important goals. Oppenheimer, on the other hand, is brazenly challenged by the women whom he loves, uses and abuses as per convenience. He is happy to move all his scientists\u2019 families to a top-secret facility for a constant supply of moral support and free domestic labour. His wife (played by Emily Blunt) makes her displeasure clear. When he returns from work one day and questions her caretaking of their baby because of the wine bottle in her hand, she snaps that she\u2019s been taking care of him all day, isolated from her friends and family, forced into secrecy, with barely a say in the matter. She breezily stands up to government officials who order her husband around. She doesn\u2019t worship the myth because she\u2019s married to it. She isn\u2019t enamoured by the \u201csocially inept male genius who is absolved all his sins for the greater good\u201d, a common trope in biopics about famous 20th-century scientists like Alan Turing (The Imitation Game), Stephen Hawking (The Theory of Everything), John Nash (A Beautiful Mind) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (The Man Who Knew Infinity). This film in Nolan\u2019s oeuvre, finally, looks back at the male saviour and asks, \u201cWhile you\u2019re out there saving the world, who\u2019s looking after the baby?\u201d That isn\u2019t the only long-standing critique Nolan has responded to. He has always dangled a sly question mark over his films\u2019 political underpinnings. He\u2019s made some movies which look apolitical \u2013 like Interstellar, Prestige, Inception, Following or Memento. Then he\u2019s made some which are subtly conservative \u2013 like the Dark Knight trilogy (about a vigilante who violently interrogates and apprehends criminals, uses mass surveillance tactics, and takes down anarchists frustrated with systemic corruption and inequality) and Dunkirk (about the rescue of Allied soldiers from a deadlocked beach, topped off with a jingoistic finale of Winston Churchill applauding the war effort). But with a powder-keg of a subject like the atom bomb, Nolan dives headlong into the headlines of the era and how Oppenheimer featured in them. He\u2019s a scientist, but an intellectually voracious one, so devours texts like Das Kapital and Bhagavad Gita to know what their ideological and spiritual fuss is about. He takes shots at everyone \u2013 military generals, college-going communists, power-hungry politicians. He is amused and confused by the knee-jerk fear that words like \u201csocialism\u201d evoke in American living rooms. He is annoyed by White America\u2019s cultural arrogance \u2013 when asked what should be done with the bomb testing site in New Mexico after the test is successful, he says, \u201cGive it back to the Indians,\u201d referring to Spanish invasion of the Native Americans in the 16th century. Oppenheimer keeps trying to be just a scientist but is forced to grow into a politician. The film he\u2019s in cares deeply about clashing ideologies, and Oppenheimer couldn\u2019t care less. In fact, the film doesn\u2019t even see science and rationality as the ultimate solution to all of mankind\u2019s problems, a na\u00efve sentiment Oppenheimer starts out his story with. \u201cGenius is no guarantee of wisdom,\u201d his mentor says, harkening to a dominant 20th-century art movement \u2013 postmodernism \u2013 that alleges science is just another story, just another human activity like religion or mythology, upheld by numbers and equations instead of belief and community, incapable of solving all human problems across space and time. To think that ethical science will solve that fundamental human folly \u2013 irrationality \u2013 is na\u00efve. To think that the world is split into oppressors and saviours, wokeism and fascism, heroes and villains, is a mistake. Oppenheimer is forced to swallow this bitter pill. He\u2019s not a martyr, not a prophet, not a Jesus \u2013 or he\u2019s all of that, along with being a small-town boy who struck big and got a shot at eternal glory. Watch this movie like you would listen to a piece of music. It\u2019s talkative and dialogue-heavy, so if it gets too much, follow the rhythm of the scenes, and don\u2019t get bogged down in the words \u2013 the music will swell and ebb and flow and swirl with the intensity of the scenes. Let it carry you. Above all, remember the suggestion Vonnegut\u2019s war veteran receives when he despairs about his inability to forget war victims: \u201cPity the men who had to do it.\u201d You will find silence and nothing to applaud. udbhav.seth@expressindia.com",

            "text": "Entertainment Why Indians Are Upset With Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy And Censor Board admin July 22, 2023 0 5 min read Home Entertainment Oppenheimer Sex Scene Debate Explained: Why Indians Are Upset With Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy And Censor Board A sex scene in Christopher Nolan\u2019s movie Oppenheimer has brought the Censor Board under fire. It shows Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh getting intimate. Here\u2019s what the whole issue is about. Oppenheimer Sex Scene Debate Explained Why Indians Are Upset With Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy And Censor Board Oppenheimer has taken a fabulous opening at the Box Office India. The word-of-mouth around the film has been strong and the fans of Christopher Nolan have been especially excited to explore the Bhagavad Gita connect in the film. However, little did anyone know that the film would be carrying a scene with the potential to upset the larger masses in India. What is in The Controversial Sex Scene From Oppenheimer? The Cillian Murphy starrer has come under fire for a particular scene in which the actor is seen reading Bhagavad Gita while having sex. The scene in question has created an uproar on social media with a section of the audience calling it a disrespect to the sentiments of Hindus and the Hindu holy book. Cillian\u2019s Oppenheimer and Florence Pugh\u2018s Jean are seen engaged in intercourse when the latter walks to his bookshelf and picks up the Gita. After being failed to understand the language, she gives it to Oppie to read as they engage in the sexual act. Oppie takes Lod Vishnu\u2019s name and reads from the holy book of the Hindus while engaging in the act. The Indian version of the film doesn\u2019t show nudity, the act of intimacy is clear in the scene. Oppenheimer\u2019s Sex Scene Creates Uproar in India The fact that the Censor Board let the scene make the final cut of the movie in India without thinking of its repercussions \u2013 has emerged as a big debate on social media. While a section is debating how one should simply enjoy the film without bringing their sentiments in between, another section is adamant and has called for the boycott of the film in India. One Twitter user wrote, \u201cHundreds of lessons about history & science but people chose to get offended over how Bhagwad Gita was recited during a Sex scene. People can\u2019t enjoy any movie without getting their religious sentiments hurt (sic).\u201d Another user slammed Nolan for not being able to respect the Hindu culture in its full essence and using it to grab eyeballs for his film. \u201cShame on India\u2019s censor board for allowing this. Christopher Nolan is a typical Hollywood racist. He completely shut out all the Indian fighters in WWI movie and now he is making crude sexual references to Hinduism. Porno perverts from the West again exploit Hindu texts (sic),\u201d he wrote.

            "text": "After delivering the biggest Hollywood opening of the year, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer continued to dominate the box office in India on its second day. According to early estimates by industry tracker Sacnilk, the film raked in an impressive Rs 17 crore on its second day, bringing its total collection to Rs 31.50 crore to date. On July 21, Oppenheimer achieved the highest opening for a Hollywood film in India, surpassing Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which had earned Rs 12.50 crore on its opening day. Oppenheimer garnered Rs 14.50 crore on its first day. However, the film witnessed an even greater audience turnout on Saturday, with a substantial Rs 17 crore collection across all languages. On Saturday, the movie recorded an overall 59.99 percent English occupancy. Internationally, Oppenheimer is facing tough competition against Greta Gerwig's Barbie but so far, the Indian market is favouring Nolan's film as Barbie's first two day collection here stands at Rs 11.50 crore. Oppenheimer portrays the life of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who was appointed by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves during World War II to lead the Manhattan Project. He was the leader of the team of scientists behind the creation of the world's first atomic bombs. Starring Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer, the film boasts an impressive ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon in pivotal roles. Critics have lavished praise on Oppenheimer, with The Indian Express critic Shalini Langer giving it 4.5 stars and stating, \"Nolan isn't attempting to dazzle with high-concept science in Oppenheimer, focusing less on the technicalities of fusion and fission, uranium and plutonium, and more on delving into the inner universe of the man who would become the father of the atom bomb.\"",

            "text": "\"Barbenheimer\" didn't just work -- it spun box office gold. The social media-fuelled fusion of Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" brought moviegoers back to the theatres in record numbers this weekend, vastly outperforming projections and giving a glimmer of hope to the lagging exhibition business, amid the sobering backdrop of strikes. Warner Bros.' \"Barbie\" claimed the top spot with a massive US$155 million in ticket sales from North American theatres from 4,243 locations, surpassing \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (as well as every Marvel movie this year) as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first weekend record for a film directed by a woman. Universal's \"Oppenheimer\" also soared past expectations, taking in $80.5 million from 3,610 theatres in the U.S. and Canada, marking Nolan's biggest non-Batman debut and one of the best-ever starts for an R-rated biographical drama. It's also the first time that one movie opened to more than $100 million and another movie opened to more than $80 million in the same weekend. When all is settled, it will likely turn out to be the fourth biggest box office weekend of all time with over $300 million industrywide. And all this in a marketplace that increasingly curved towards intellectual property-driven winner takes all. The \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon may have started out as good-natured competition between two aesthetic opposites, but, as many hoped, both movies benefitted in the end. The only real casualty was \"Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,\" which despite strong reviews and a healthy opening weekend fell 64 per cent in weekend two. Overshadowed by the \"Barbenheimer\" glow as well as the blow of losing its IMAX screens to \"Oppenheimer,\" the Tom Cruise vehicle added $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $118.8 million. \"Barbenheimer\" is not merely counterprogramming either. But while a certain section of enthusiastic moviegoers overlapped, in aggregate the audiences were distinct. Women drove the historic \"Barbie\" opening, making up 65 per cent of the audience, according to PostTrak, and 40 per cent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25 for the PG-13 rated movie. \"It's just a joyous time in the world. This is history in so many ways,\" said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.' president of domestic distribution. \"I think this marketing campaign is one for the ages that people will be talking about forever.\" \"Oppenheimer\" audiences meanwhile were 62 per cent male and 63 per cent over the age of 25, with a somewhat surprising 32 per cent that were between the ages of 18 and 24. Both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" scored well with critics with 90 per cent and 94 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively, and audiences who gave both films an A CinemaScore. And social media has been awash with reactions and \"takes\" all weekend -- good, bad, problematic and everywhere in between -- the kind of organic, event cinema, watercooler debate that no marketing budget can buy. \"The `Barbenheimer' thing was a real boost for both movies,\" Goldstein said. \"It is a crowning achievement for all of us.\" \"Oppenheimer\" had the vast majority (80 per cent) of premium large format screens at its disposal. Some 25 theatres in North America boasted IMAX 70mm screenings ( Nolan's preferred format ), most of which were completely sold out all weekend -- accounting for two per cent of the total gross. Theatres even scrambled to add more to accommodate the demand including 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. screenings, which also sold out. \"Nolan's films are truly cinematic events,\" said Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic distribution. IMAX showings alone made up 26 per cent of the domestic gross (or $21.1 million) from only 411 screens and 20 per cent of the global gross, and \"Oppenheimer\" will have at least a three-week run on those high-demand screens. \"This is a phenomenon beyond compare,\" said Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX, in a statement. \"Around the world, we've seen sellouts at 4:00 a.m. shows and people travelling hours across borders to see `Oppenheimer' in IMAX 70mm.\" This is the comeback weekend Hollywood has been dreaming of since the pandemic. There have been big openings and successes -- \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" among them, but the fact that two movies are succeeding at the same time is notable. \"It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,\" said Michael O'Leary, President & CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \"People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.\" And yet in the background looms disaster as Hollywood studios continue to squabble with striking actors and writers over a fair contract. \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were the last films on the 2023 calendar to get a massive, global press tour. Both went right up to the 11th hour, squeezing in every last moment with their movie stars. \"Oppenheimer\" even pushed up its London premiere by an hour, knowing that Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy would have to leave to symbolically join the picket lines by the time the movie began. Without movie stars to promote their films, studios have started pushing some falls releases, including the high-profile Zendaya tennis drama \"Challengers.\" But for now, it's simply a positive story that could even continue for weeks to come. \"There could be a sequel next weekend,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \"The FOMO factor will rachet up because of this monumental box office event centered around the movie theatre experience.\"",

IMAX showings alone made up 26 per cent of the domestic gross (or $21.1 million) from only 411 screens and 20 per cent of the global gross, and Oppenheimer will have at least a three-week run on those high-demand screens. \"This is a phenomenon beyond compare,\" Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX, said in a statement. \"Around the world, we've seen sellouts at 4 a.m. shows and people travelling hours across borders to see Oppenheimer in IMAX 70mm.\" This is the comeback weekend Hollywood has been dreaming of since the pandemic. There have been big openings and successes \u2014 Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, Avatar: The Way of Water among them \u2014 but the fact that two movies are succeeding at the same time is notable. \"It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,\" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \"People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.\" Studios pushing some movies due to strikes And yet in the background looms disaster as Hollywood studios continue to squabble with striking actors and writers over a fair contract. Barbie and Oppenheimer were the last films on the 2023 calendar to get a massive, global press tour. Both went right up to the 11th hour, squeezing in every last moment with their movie stars. Oppenheimer even pushed up its London premiere by an hour, knowing that Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy would have to leave to symbolically join the picket lines by the time the movie began. Without movie stars to promote their films, studios have started pushing some fall releases, including the high-profile Zendaya tennis drama Challengers. But for now, it's simply a positive story that could even continue for weeks to come. \"There could be a sequel next weekend,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \"The FOMO (fear of missing out) factor will rachet up because of this monumental box office event centred around the movie theatre experience.\"",

            "text": "As the Atomic Heritage Foundation (AHF) says, neither Dorothy Vanderford (n\u00e9e Oppenheimer) nor Charles Oppenheimer knew their grandfather. Dorothy was born in 1973 and Charles in 1975. Sites like Insider confirm that little information exists about J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s third grandchild, Ella, although Oppenheimer\u2019s mother was named Ella. This means that Peter Oppenheimer named one of his daughters after his grandmother. As News 3LV explains, Dorothy has followed closest in her grandfather\u2019s physical footsteps. She works at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), a nuclear response-and-readiness facility dedicated to nuclear nonproliferation, U.S. national security, and \u201clong-term environmental stewardship of the NNSS\u2019s Cold War legacy.\u201d Interestingly, until 2010 the NNSS used to be the Nevada Test Site (NTS), the President Harry Truman-appointed stretch of desert 65 miles north of Las Vegas used for nuclear bomb testing in the 1950s. As of 2023, News 3LV said Dorothy is a technical writer in her role at the facility. Charles also plays an active role in his grandfather\u2019s legacy. His bio on the Oppenheimer Project \u2014 an Oppenheimer family-run organization \u201ccommitted to honoring the legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer\u201d \u2014 describes him as a software developer, investor, and entrepreneur. In the same vein his Twitter bio says that he \u201crepresent[s] the family of J. Robert Oppenheimer.\u201d He\u2019s also written op-eds about his grandfather on sites like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, where he describes his grandfather as a science-loving person who did his duty to his country and was shunned after the fact.",

In this scene, the two sleep together for the first time following a communist party gathering. Midway through intercourse, Jean picks up a bound copy of the Hindu scripture \"Bhagavad Gita\" from Oppenheimer's bookshelf, and asks him to read from it \u2013 where we get the foreboding quote, \"Now I become death, the destroyer of worlds\" \u2013 before proceeding with the act as he continues to read. Although the film has received rave reviews, this scene has garnered immense criticism from Hindu nationalist group, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for its insertion of religious scripture into sexual intercourse. Disclaimer: I started squirming in my seat during the scene and spent a good 10 minutes afterwards in the bathroom stall, calming myself down. Then I bought a blue Icee and ran back in to watch the rest. The scene, although uncomfortable, was mind-opening. All of a sudden my present started to articulate my past forward as I was transported out of the movie theater and into my eighth grade health classroom. Today's topic: the forms of sex. All three forms \u2013 as my teacher called it. As someone who didn't even know that sex existed until that moment, I immediately started twisting in my chair and had to leave the room as the teacher's descriptions got more and more detailed. My mind could not handle the fact that two people could crave touching each other's private parts out of choice or out of adoration. But several of my classmates were unfazed. And several of them laughed at my reaction for weeks. At that point, I knew I had to change. I had to take initiative to learn what my parents had always avoided discussing with me. So, I started reading \"Game of Thrones\" and its fanfiction to educate myself. And lots of it. By the time I had finished high school and college, I had read so much of it that I thought I had numbed my mind to sexual thought and literary depiction. But that \"Oppenheimer\" Gita sex scene told me differently. When I saw it on screen, I still could not handle it. Growing up in a conservative Indian American household in the midwestern United States, I never heard from my parents discussions about certain bodily actions seen as \"obscene\" or taboo and why society perceived them in that way. I'd never seen them even kiss each other in front of my sister and me. I never had a person who could talk candidly with me about embarrassing or scary changes in my body and make them no longer seem so mysterious and foreign. After that revelatory eighth grade sexual health education class, there were questions that I was dying to ask but knew it was not OK to ask my mom or dad. To them, there was no comedy nor beauty in discussing sex and sexuality, especially when they were starting from scratch with someone like me, who was on the brink of puberty but still had many gaps in her knowledge. I wondered why my parents always shied away from this topic \u2013 even when it is something so deeply human and important. \"You don't have to know these things. The more you know about it, the more you will want to jump in earlier,\" my mom would say. \"I don't know why they teach these things to kids so early in this country.\" Two years later, in 10th grade world history class, I was a raging \"Game of Thrones\" fan who had read almost every Sansa/Tyrion fanfic on the internet (including the rated M for mature ones). We were learning about ancient India, and my favorite teacher of all time told us something that shocked me more than the Oppenheimer scene: that early Indian civilization was a pioneer in and center of sexual desire. Across the whiteboard he had written in all caps these words: KAMA SUTRA. \"Do you know what this is,\" he yelled across the room to the whole class. \"Anyone? How about you, Sibani?\" I was the only Indian American student in my high school class. I honestly and vigorously shook my head. I worshiped this man on many levels, but I sincerely did not know the answer to his question. I was also embarrassed that I didn't know about this supposedly very important text from my own culture. \"This is a book . . . about sex,\" he continued. \"All the different positions and the ways to enjoy them. And it originated in INDIA.\" I felt my face flush. My parents had ensured that I watch re-enacted versions of the Indian epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana on our tiny TV screen in my small Iowan midwestern town. My late grandmother had ensured that I learned how to speak my native language TamiI, and my parents pushed me to retain that. They put me through Carnatic singing lessons over the phone to help me better connect with my heritage and culture. Yet, they had conveniently chosen not to mention this uncomfortable but fascinating truth about the book of sex originating in India. That day, I went home and scoured the internet. And what my genius of a world history teacher had told me was beyond true. It turned out that I did not have to even turn to the internet, but rather had to dig back into my own memories of visiting temples across South India during my summers and sometimes seeing their walls adorned with near-naked female idols. When visiting, I remember being a bit surprised that these sculptures were not taken down by the conservative Indian communities that surrounded them. However, history reveals that the communities that initially surrounded the sculptures may have been ones where sex and spirituality were united, not untied. For example, the seven-foot-tall Sathyamurthi Perumal Temple in my motherland of Tamil Nadu, India features detailed and sacred architecture depicting intercourse. In fact, these structures are protected by the Archeological Survey of India. This is not a standalone example. The juxtaposition of sexuality and sanctity can be seen in Hindu temples ranging from the Sun Temple in Gujarat to the Jain temples of Rajasthan to the Virupaksha temple in Karnataka \u2013 all located in India. Early India's fascination with sex is not limited to architecture but also spills over into literature beyond the \"Kama Sutra.\" While the major Hindu epics \"Mahabharata\" and \"Ramayana\" are certainly not as pornographic as \"Game of Thrones,\" these ancient religious epics are far from devoid of the depictions of sexual pleasure. The pages contain stories of great sages committed to abstinence, who could resist everything but the temptations of sex. Draupadi, a pivotal character in \"Mahabharata\" and powerful example of polyandry, simultaneously keeps and sleeps with five husbands. Hindu scripture is not devoid of sexual exposure. In fact, the \"Gita \"that Oppenheimer invests his mind in is derived from a scene in the \"Mahabharata.\" When my mom sent me an article on the Hindu nationalists' criticism of the questionable sex scene in \"Oppenheimer,\" I immediately defended the Western approach to sex. \"The difference between the Western world and the Indian one is that the Western one can own up to human temptations and sins, versus in India, we like to hide from what makes us human anyway. Just remember that India \u2013 not USA \u2013 was the earliest erotic place in the world where a so-called 'book' originated. Read beyond headlines,\" I wrote in response. However, I now realize that my scathing response \u2013 while it is not fully false \u2013 lacks sensitivity. The \"Gita\" is a sacred text. While it does encourage sex for procreation, it discourages sex for pleasure. I do not agree with that principle in the \"Gita\" (isn't sex called making love for a reason?), but I do think Nolan crossed the line a bit. Just a bit. But only a bit. Even if the scene made me very uncomfortable, walking through Hindu temples trying to recite prayers and seeing naked copulation sculptures has also made me very uncomfortable. So, when the Hindu nationalist BJP calls the scene a \"disturbing attack on Hinduism\" that \"wages a war on the Hindu community,\" that is not at all accurate either. The earliest Hindus saw sex as a soul of their religion and culture. Maybe that is not how things are today, but as a Hindu woman myself, history and religion calls upon me to pursue the truth. The truth is that sex was a characteristic of early Hindu civilizations in a way that was arguably more explicit than any scene in \"Oppenheimer.\" The truth is that my parents and several of my Indian American friends' parents unfortunately often avoid this reality. The truth is that Nolan saw the raw sexual stuff of life as text to be read, art to be created and conversation to be generated. If anything, this scene pays tribute to the reality that several sacred Hindu spaces \u2013 even if this excludes the \"Bhagavad Gita\" itself \u2013 do indeed sing of the sexual. To all Hindus in this world \u2013 including the BJP \u2013 let's not be angry and offended. We've not earned the right to be given the past. Instead, let's invite a responsible dialogue about what history can teach us about our own religion. And then, we can talk about how we would like for that religion to be accurately represented.",

            "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic on the theoretical scientist Robert Oppenheimer, who became known as the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d, has an epic soundtrack. We follow Oppenheimer\u2019s early work in Europe, establishing the Los Alamos lab, the creation of the atomic bombs released on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, his later activism against nuclear development and its repercussions in his later life. The music and sound design are integral to telling this dark story. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s score immerses the audience in the inner emotional dilemma of a man on the brink of unleashing the potential destruction of humanity, while the sound design illustrates flashbacks, physical phenomena and atoms clashing with each other. Read more: 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds': who was atom bomb pioneer Robert Oppenheimer? Drawing on music history Sound in Nolan\u2019s films is characteristically loud and arresting, accompanied by epic music scores. Oppenheimer\u2019s score moves from the gentle and personal to an imposing sound spectacle that heightens the intensity of the plot. The violin forms the basis of the score. From the film\u2019s opening track, the violin\u2019s ability to shift from a hauntingly beautiful sound quality (or timbre) to a screeching descending melody to an intimate whispery tone draws us into Oppenheimer\u2019s intense inner dilemma. The violin is fitting to depict such a complex and intense character. G\u00f6ransson\u2019s score draws on performance techniques with a rich cinematic and concert hall legacy. In Psycho, the short, sharp screech of the violins played in repeated clusters punctuates the rising tension. This is echoed in Oppenheimer: to underscore the visuals of atoms spinning, G\u00f6ransson layers string harmonics in an escalating crescendo of quivering energy. In Mozart\u2019s requiem (a mass of the dead) Lacrimosa, the haunting simplicity of the opening melody played by the violins feels raw and immediately draws the listener in. Here, when the scientists learn of the bombing of Japan, the violin plays a two-note melody. This simple composition contains the enormity of the situation. The tension of the violin The violin is a fretless instrument, allowing traditional performance techniques including harmonics and vibrato. Harmonics is an overtone you hear when you place your finger softly on the string and play with the violin bow. By not pushing the string down to the fingerboard, the string vibrates on both sides of your finger to create a whistling sound. Vibrato is the tiny fluctuations in pitch caused by rocking the finger from the wrist or arm to create warmth and expressiveness in performance. In this score, G\u00f6ransson also employs non-traditional techniques such as tapping or hitting the body of the violin with the bow. When these traditional and non-traditional performance techniques combine, the juxtaposition creates tension between the warm and more brittle sound qualities of the violin. A scene in the classroom exemplifies the lyrical sound quality of violins that build in numbers. When Oppenheimer is alone one violin plays. As three people join him, three violins join in the composition. As the classroom fills \u2013 and as his excitement in talking about quantum physics grows \u2013 there is a build to the whole orchestra playing. The violins shift to tension strings performing various rhythmic patterns and performance techniques. These combine with electronic instruments that musically fluctuate between hope, anxiety and despair. As the scene progresses, the horns come thundering in as a warning of the destruction to come. The sound of silence G\u00f6ransson\u2019s unrelenting score features in roughly 2.5 hours of the three-hour film. The orchestral blend of piano and harps runs alongside the sounds of Oppenheimer\u2019s world. Feet stomping, synthesisers pulsing, clocks ticking and the electrical static of Geiger counters create a sound world of tension, dread and anticipation. G\u00f6ransson uses rhythmic techniques such as triplets \u2013 when three notes are played in the space of two \u2013 to build the intensity and to create escalating cross-rhythms during the Trinity nuclear test. The layers of strings playing harmonics and rhythmic patterns build in intensity to create an impression of momentum building. These techniques bring a sense of agitation, heightening the drama and building energy. The music builds in intensity up to the moment of silence when the button is pushed: there is no turning back. The score falling silent is as important as the music itself. When Oppenheimer delivers his speech after the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, each jingoistic comment is followed by increasing applause and noise. When the sound suddenly drops out, we are left with his empty words. When the film only includes the \u201cnaked\u201d sound of the world on screen, we feel the gravity of the situation. When we experience dynamic builds in anticipation in a music score, our dopamine levels naturally increase. Sudden silence creates moments of intense focus. The contrast between the fullness of the orchestra and the silence immerses us in the world. We experience an emotional release. The silence propels us into a feeling of suspended time: an almost deafening reminder of humanity through the use of close and intimate human sounds. It is one of the most potent features used throughout the three-hour film. Read more: Music inspires powerful emotions on screen, just like in real life",

            "text": "Young Lucy Benavidez Gardwood was tucked up in her bed with her siblings over 78 years ago when she was violently awoken by her family's home being violently shaken after J Robert Oppenheimer tested out his creation of the world's first atomic bomb. The then 13-year-old said the blast was so powerful, she thought her house had been struck by a car and her neighbours in the small town of Tularosa in New Mexico believed there had been an earthquake. A few miles west, farmers working on the fertile fields at 5.29am believed the world was ending as a great flash of light appeared before their eyes. This was the moment 'Oppenheimer's curse' fell upon their community. It was not until several weeks later that the small village in Otero County would learn the truth about what happened to their home, when the US forces dropped the American theoretical physicist's nuclear bomb on the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in Japan, the Mirror reports. Lucy, who is now 91 years old, recalled the terrifying experience, as she said: \u201cThe reality is America dropped it on their own people first, and no one ever gave a s*** about us. They still don\u2019t. Because we were poor and uneducated, we were seen as disposable. \u201cWe were Oppenheimer\u2019s first victims but we still remain last in getting the help we need. We have had not one cent, yet our families have been blighted by cancer and death ever since.\u201d Oppenheimer, who has been dubbed the 'father of the atomic bomb', used the small New Mexico town's backyard as a testing site for his deadly Manhattan Project, leaving behind a truly devastating legacy that still continues to this day. Despite the recent Hollywood glamorisation of his historical work in the successful hit movie, where the late controversial physicist was re-enacted by Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer left behind a legacy of high cancer rates and cruel government secrecy. Now, almost eight decades on, Tularosa is still suffering from this horrendous tragedy in their village and their people are still fighting for justice. Hundreds, if not thousands, of New Mexico's Downwinders - the people who lived downwind of the test site where the risks from fallout or radiation leaks were the highest - continue their battle for compensation over the heartbreaking cancers they believe the test bomb caused in hundreds of victims. But, much like they have been since that terrible night on July 16, 1945, the recent Christopher Nolan-directed movie which tells the story of Oppenheimer's creation has also erased their plight. The Oscar-tipped film disregarded the New Mexican people who took the full force of the catastrophic blast and its deadly fallout as the Hollywood hit failed to make any mention of them. Lucy vividly remembers Oppenheimer's bomb, comparable to around 25,000 tons of TNT, like it was yesterday. She recalls how the world admired the power of the lethal invention amid the celebration of the Second World War ending, leaving Tularosa to suffer in poor health caused by the explosion. The Manhattan Project National Historical Park claims that vast amounts of radiation were blasted into the atmosphere, which descended over an area of 250 miles along and 200 miles wide. Scientists tracked part of the fallout pattern as far as the Atlantic Ocean, which was some 1450 miles away, but the greatest concentration settled 50 miles from the test site. Government officials decided upon the Trinity Test Site as it was remote and flat with predictable winds. The deadly bomb's plutonium mushroom cloud, which soared 10 miles into the sky, sent nuclear dust covering the Tularosa Basin for weeks. Due to the secret nature of Oppenheimer's work, residents in the surrounding area were not warned before the explosion and the aftermath saw ash cover every building, road and field. It then seeped into the local water supply and invaded the food chain as animals ate the contaminated grass. Lucy explains: \u201cIt was only when our sheep, goats and chickens began to become ill and die that we started to realise just how exposed we had been. No one ever told us about the bomb. They made us believe it was an ammunition explosive at a nearby military base. They lied and lied to us about what really happened. They still do. \u201cNo community has been left untouched by Oppenheimer\u2019s curse on this land. Three of my four daughters contracted cancer. Hundreds of others have too. No one from the government stepped forward and helped. All neighbouring states have been compensated \u2013 and yet never has the site which took the brunt of the bomb seen a cent.\u201d The cruel irony of the Downwinder's plight is that the very officials who carried out the Trinity test also betrayed them through calculated deception. The US government deliberately hid information about the potential dangers of radiation, leaving the Downwinders defenceless. Perhaps the most obvious injustice is the glaring disparity in compensation across states while some Downwinders in other regions have been supported for what happened to them, the people of New Mexico have been left to deal with the tragedy in isolation. Recent research discovered that within 10 days, the fallout had reached 46 states, Mexico and Canada. It found that the accumulation of radioactive material was greater than was what was proposed under a government compensation programme in 28 of the 33 counties in New Mexico. As a result, more than \u00a32billion has been handed out through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, but the battle for compensation has been a Herculean task, marked by bureaucratic barriers and systemic indifference. While other states have received reparation for their injustice, New Mexico's Downwinders have been refused the same acknowledgments. Now, as several lawmakers battle to see the state included, they are hit with a further problem as the RECA law is set to expire, despite being recently extended. Once that ends, it may take the Downwinders any chance for help with it too. As the movie, shown in Tularosa\u2019s neighbouring town of Alamogordo, continues to make billions of dollars off the event, the local community who suffered the tragedy first hand remains on the sidelines. Tina Cordova, 62, a cancer survivor and founder of a group of New Mexico Downwinders who was raised in Tularosa, said: \u201cThey\u2019ll never reflect on the fact that New Mexicans gave their lives. They invaded our lives and our lands, and then they left.\u201d However, survivor Lucy Benavidez Gardwood, who despite losing one of her daughter's to Oppenheimer's invention does not share much of her village's fury, said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any anger, just hurt. Our fight is not about compensation, we just want medical help.\u201d Despite all that's happened to her, the 91-year-old has still managed to retain her sense of humour. When asked what the secret was to how she remains so active and alert in her old age, she replied: \u201cProbably because I was nuked.\u201d Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

            "title": "Barbie v Oppenheimer: Together they are Barbenheimer and fans are debating the best way to enjoy them both",
            "text": "2023\u2019s biggest box-office smackdown sees two of the year\u2019s most highly anticipated films, Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, released on the same day (20 July \u2013 mark your calendars). It\u2019s a match made in heaven. He was a theoretical physicist. She was a Barbie. Can we make it any more obvious? To celebrate, the internet has united in a frenzy of heavily-memed joy, planning double screenings, creating \u201cBarbOppenheimer\u201d merch and praising the films for putting bums back on cinema seats. The stark contrast between the two films has made for great fodder, but there\u2019s a more serious reason for our obsession with the two films \u2013 the future of cinema might just be relying on them both. For this reason, the Barbie marketing campaign has gone into overdrive. Barbie\u2019s pink campaign has taken over buses, Airbnbs, Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach pool, your Instagram feed. It\u2019s a Barbie world after all! (Life in plastic? Fantastic! Life in uranium? Non-existent!) Aside from the organic marketing (memes, T-shirts), Barbie is enjoying a cornucopia of licensed brand agreements, including GAP\u2019s Barbie clothing line, Pinkberry\u2019s Barbie icecream and electric toothbrushes. One is blonde, the other is a bombshell. Together, they\u2019re here to save cinema. That\u2019s because the Barbie x Oppenheimer showdown arrives with more than just the burden of expectations. There are commercial pressures on both films to resuscitate an anaemic global box-office, after Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny had weak returns and The Flash became one of the lowest-scoring superhero films of all-time. Fans are delighted by the prospect of two diametrically opposed films duking it out for the top of the box-office. And the trailers for both films have helped fuel hype \u2013 and also underlined their stark difference in subject matter. Nolan\u2019s near-three hour Oppenheimer biopic paints a solemn ode to the mastermind behind the atomic bomb, taking us inside the world-ending possibilities of the Manhattan Project. Gerwig\u2019s Barbie film is the perfect riposte, a day-glo fantasia summoning a world of pure imagination, hinting at a new feminist fantasy take on the beloved doll. Together, they are \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d or \u201cBoppenheimer\u201d, and fans are debating the best way to enjoy them both. Social media is awash with opinions on whether to enjoy Barbie first \u2013 and then to end the day on a sombre note with Oppenheimer \u2013 or the other way round \u2013 it\u2019s a debate for the ages. The competition has gone not just viral, but nuclear \u2013 the counter-programming has proved a miraculous hit. In a year of cinema that has seen The Super Mario Bros. Movie become one of the highest-grossing films, it\u2019s clear audiences have an appetite for films targeted at adults. To keep the Barbie parade going, Barbie star Margot Robbie and Ken, Ryan Gosling, have enjoyed a press tour sporting resplendently pink looks. They\u2019ve even joked about the crossover \u2013 Gerwig and Robbie were photographed proudly brandishing their Oppenheimer tickets in front of that film\u2019s poster (Nolan and Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy have yet to do the same for Barbie). In fact, Oppenheimer is basically enjoying millions of dollars of free marketing thanks to the Barbie stands, which is a relief, considering the most they\u2019ve managed to do so far is bring Cillian Murphy out for an occasional appearance on Zoom. It\u2019s not a matter of \u201cwhich film do we see?\u201d but rather \u201cwhich film do we see first?\u201d, as the playful rivalry brings out film fans of all colours to stump for the medium, as it limps back after the effects of the pandemic and the streaming wars. There\u2019s a certain joy to be had that these are two original films (based on existing properties, sure, but not sequels, reboots, or remakes \u2013 unless you count Barbie and the Swan) are likely to rule the box office. But, in the battle of the box office, there can only be one No. 1. This writer\u2019s bet? This Barbie will be a box-office champion. He\u2019s just J. Robert Oppenheimer.",

            "text": "Robert Downey Jr. recently teamed up with Cillian Murphy for the Christopher Nolan picture Oppenheimer. And although they got along well on set, Downey confided there were moments where Murphy was chilling to work with. Robert Downey Jr. shared what it was like working with Cillian Murphy in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Downey had little to no hesitation acting in Christopher Nolan\u2019s newest movie Oppenheimer. The actor was actually in the midst of taking a break from the film industry when he heard about the project. \u201cI had been cooling my heels for about a year before the pandemic, just reacquainting myself with my family and other interests because I had been working super consistently,\u201d Downey said according to News 18. \u201cBut this was Christopher Nolan, doing something that was important to him. The cast was this large gathering of folks who have their choice of projects. And just as soon as we were under way, world events lined up in a way that turned this movie into an important metaphor that could speak to any number of things. So, it was kind of a no- brainer.\u201d This large cast was made up of stars like Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Cillian Murphy. Downey witnessed up close and personal how Murphy was able to immerse himself into his role as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy\u2019s transition into the father of the atom bomb couldn\u2019t help occasionally make Downey uncomfortable. \u201cEven just by the time I was on set, seeing how Cillian had embodied this character, to the point where you go like, \u2018I\u2019m practically with the guy.\u2019 You can\u2019t help but feel a little bit iced out by it,\u201d Downey told Extra TV. \u201cNow, Cillian is so warm and nice and inviting. But then we\u2019d roll, and I\u2019d feel like he was looking through me like I didn\u2019t exist. And I was like, \u2018That sucks.\u2019\u201d Christopher Nolan considers Robert Downey Jr. one of the greatest actors of all time Nolan had been looking to work with Downey for many years now, but the opportunity never came to do so until recently. Nolan was hoping to work with the Marvel star for a couple of decades now. \u201cI\u2019ve always known since I first met him \u2013 however many years ago it is now, almost 20 years \u2013 that he is one of the great actors, not just of his generation, but of all time,\u201d Nolan said in an interview with Total Film. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been waiting for the project, and I know he has too, where we can collaborate with him as the lead, and I could put the most enormous weight \u2013 cinematic weight \u2013 on his shoulders, and watch him carry that burden. It was such a thrill to be able to call Cillian, and say, \u2018This is it.\u2019\u201d Nolan believed that his opinion was only solidified after watching Downey\u2019s work in Oppenheimer. \u201cWatching him lose himself in that performance, and completely lose himself in a character in this way, was just an incredible reminder of just what an amazing actor he is,\u201d he said. Cillian Murphy was secretly desperate to lead \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Unlike Downey, Murphy already had a lot of experience with Nolan. Aside from Oppenheimer, Murphy appeared in all three of Nolan\u2019s Batman movies. He also had starring roles in films like Inception and Dunkirk. But Oppenheimer was the first time Murphy found himself playing the lead role in one of Nolan\u2019s films. It was an opportunity that Murphy spent years internally clamoring for. \u201cI have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I\u2019m available and you want me to be in a movie, I\u2019m there. I don\u2019t really care about the size of the part,\u201d Murphy told Associated Press. \u201cBut deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.\u201d",

            "text": "Though President Harry Truman would give J. Robert Oppenheimer a presidential citation and Medal for Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project in 1946, after their sole 1945 meeting, Oppenheimer was effectively cut out of Truman\u2019s inner circle for the development, safety, and management of atomic weaponry. When Oppenheimer mentioned having blood on his own hands, Truman reportedly responded that if anyone had blood on his hands it was the president. \u201c[T]he blood is on my hands, let me worry about that,\u201d Truman said (via Newsweek). According to Truman, the authorized use of two atomic bombs to end the war with Japan saved countless future lives, justifying the decision \u2014 a notion the 33rd U.S. president clung to throughout his life. After Nagasaki was bombed, though \u2014 the second of two U.S. attacks \u2014 Oppenheimer\u2019s views changed. Distressed at the sheer scope of the destruction, by the time Oppenheimer and Truman met face to face, the scientist hoped international cooperation might keep atomic weaponry under control. Oppenheimer was dismayed, then, when Truman seemed intent on keeping nuclear technology a secret from the Soviets. Beginning in 1944, efforts were already underway to keep the fearsome power of atomic weaponry exclusive to U.S. interests. Oppenheimer felt that was impossible, and by attempting to do so, an arms race would inevitably erupt between the two countries. For those concerns, Truman would reportedly call Oppenheimer the \u201ccry-baby scientist.\u201d",

But just hours before the London monument celebrated the blockbuster starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Trafalgar Square had been the site of the Oppenheimer photocall. Film fans are puzzled over Mayor Sadiq Khan's decision to honour fictional Barbie Land over Christopher Nolan's biographical thriller, which tells the story of the real-life theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons. The tribute is the latest move in the battle of Barbenheimer, as fans have dubbed it, as both films - set for release on the same day - hope to rake it in at the Box Office this year after spending more than \u00a376million ($100million) each on production. This is not the first time the London landmark has been transformed to mark a film release. It was also lit up as a giant lightsaber in 2015 to celebrate the premiere for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

The film, which stars Cillian Murphy, details J. Robert Oppenheimer's role in the Manhattan Project and development of nuclear weapons during World War II. 'Trafalgar Square in Barbie pink! This is quite funny considering they had the Oppenheimer premiere a few hours ago there,' one film fan tweeted. Another echoed: 'Actually very funny for Trafalgar Square to have turned pink for the Barbie premiere just a couple of hours after the Oppenheimer photocall.' A spokesperson for Mayor Khan said he was 'delighted' to support both films yesterday as they premiered in Europe. 'London is the entertainment capital of the world and the Mayor was delighted that Trafalgar Square supported launch events for both Barbie and Oppenheimer yesterday,' the spokesperson told MailOnline. 'In addition to approving the lighting of Nelson's column for the Barbie premiere, the Mayor's team also worked closely with Oppenheimer to arrange a photocall in the square.'

Barbie premiered at the Cineworld in Leicester Square yesterday Warner Bros, the firm producing and distributing the film, presumably paid a large sum to light up the monument as it cost Disney \u00a324,000 to hire the square nearly eight years ago. It was not clear how much Disney paid on top of that to light up Nelson's Column. Warner Bros is carrying out a huge marketing campaign to promote Barbie that has turned the capital city pink. London's iconic Black cabs and red double-decker buses are now Barbie pink and feature portraits of Robbie and Gosling as Barbie and Ken. Barbie's pink convertible was also on display in the capital and a bright pink Tardis police call box was placed on the banks of Tower Bridge. MailOnline has approached Warner Bros for comment. The London landmark was transformed into a lightsaber in December 2015 as stars of Star Wars: The Force Awakens followed a group of stormtroopers and Darth Vader down the red carpet during the film's European premiere at Leicester Square. The historic London landmark was turned blue to celebrate the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in December 2015 Disney's publicity stunt in 2015 led to accusations that Britain's heritage was 'up for sale' and prompted questions over why one of the country's most iconic monuments was being used to promote a Hollywood film The monument, which includes a sandstone statute by E.H. Baily, Nelson's Column, was constructed between 1840 and 1843. The four bronze lions on the base were added in 1867. The pedestal is decorated with four bronze panels, cast from captured French guns, and depict the Battle of Cape St Vincent, the Battle of the Nile, the Battle of Copenhagen and the Death of Nelson at Trafalgar. While Disney's publicity stunt in 2015 led to accusations that Britain's heritage was 'up for sale' and prompted questions over why one of the country's most iconic monuments was being used to promote a Hollywood film, author and historian James Heartfield suspects most people 'are pleased to see the column celebrated'. 'People have forgotten about Nelson largely - it's good that he is back in the public,' Mr Heartfield told MailOnline, but added that it is 'slightly contentious because he was a war hero.' 'This is a joking way of making fun of our colonial past, but I don't think people are offended,' he said. 'This is kind of a campy way to responding to it.' Mr Heartfield added: 'Nelson was a bit of a womaniser so maybe he'd be thrilled to be lit up by Barbie.' Battle of Trafalgar: Epic sea clash that laid foundations for Britain's global power - and claimed the life of Lord Admiral Nelson Nelson's (above) triumph at Trafalgar gave Britain control of the seas and laid the foundation for Britain's global power for more than a century Fought on October 21, 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar is one of history's most epic sea clashes. Not only did it see Britain eliminate the most serious threat to security in 200 years, but it also saw the death of British naval hero Admiral Lord Nelson. This was not before his high-risk, but acutely brave strategy won arguably the most decisive victory in the Napoleonic wars. Nelson's triumph gave Britain control of the seas and laid the foundation for Britain's global power for more than a century. Despite signing a peace treaty in 1803, the two nations were at war and fought each other in seas around the world. After Spain allied with France in 1804, the newly-crowned French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte had enough ships to challenge Britain. In October 1805, French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve led a Combined French and Spanish fleet of 33 ships from the Spanish port of Cadiz to face Nelson and Vice Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Fought on October 21, 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar is one of history's most epic sea clashes. Not only did it see Britain eliminate the most serious threat to security in 200 years, but it also saw the death of British naval hero Admiral Lord Nelson Nelson, fresh from chasing Villeneuve in the Caribbean, led the 27-ship fleet charge in HMS Victory, while Vice Admiral Collingwood sailed in Royal Sovereign. Battles at sea had until then been mainly inconclusive, as to fire upon the opposing ship, each vessel had to pull up along side one another (broadside) which often resulted in equal damage. Nelson bucked this trend by attacking the Combined Fleet line head on - and sailed perpendicular towards the fleet, exposing the British to heavy fire. He attacked in two columns to split the Combined Fleet's line to target the flagship of Admiral Villneuve. 11. 30am Lord Nelson famously declared that 'England expects that every man will do his duty', in reference to the command that the ships were instructed to think for themselves. The captains had been briefed on the battle plan three weeks before, and were trusted to bravely act on their own initiative and adapt to changing circumstances - unlike their opponents who stuck to their command. Vice Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood led the first column and attacked the rear of the line, and broke through. Nelson sailed directly for the head of the Combined Fleet to dissuade them from doubling back to defend the rear. But before he reached them, he changed course to attack the middle of the line - and Villeneuve's flagship. Speeding toward the centre of the line, HMS Victory found no space to break through as Villeneuve's flagship was being tightly followed - forcing Nelson to ram through at close quarters. In the heat of battle, and surrounded on three sides, Nelson was fatally shot in the chest by a well-drilled French musketeer. The Combined Fleet's vanguard finally began to come to the aid of Admiral Villeneuve, but British ships launch a counter-attack. Admiral Villeneuve struck his colours along with many other ships in the Combined Fleet and surrendered. 4.14pm HMS Victory Captain Thomas Masterman Hardy dropped below deck to congratulate Nelson on his victory. 4.30pm With the knowledge he has secured victory, but before the battle had officially concluded, Lord Nelson died. 5.30pm French ship Achille blew up signalling the end of the battle - in all 17 Combined Fleet ships surrendered. ... so did Nelson really say 'Kiss me, Hardy' with his dying words? By RICHARD CREASY for the Daily Mail (in an article from 2007) It was Britain's greatest naval victory and for more than 200 years historians have analysed every detail. Now, amazingly, a new eye-witness account of the Battle of Trafalgar has emerged during a house clear-out. It gives not only a first-hand view of proceedings from the lower decks but also a different interpretation of one of history's most enduring arguments - Admiral Lord Nelson's dying words. Robert Hilton was a 21-year-old surgeon's mate on HMS Swiftsure, a 74-gun ship that played its part in the destruction of the French and Spanish fleets and of Napoleon's dream of invading England. It was 13 days later, after Swiftsure had made it through gales to Gibraltar for repairs that Hilton took up his pen and wrote a nine-page letter home on November 3, 1805. In it he says Nelson's last words, relayed to his ship's company from Nelson's flag captain, Captain Hardy, were: 'I have then lived long enough.' Many people believe Nelson said: 'Kiss me Hardy.' But historians rely on his surgeon's reports that he said: 'Thank God I have done my duty.",
