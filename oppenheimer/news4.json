            "text": "The Screen Actors Guild announced Thursday (13 July) that it would just colleagues in the Writers Guild of America striking for fair wages. \u201cBecause the AMPTP [Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers] remains unwilling to offer a fair deal on key issues essential to protecting the livelihoods of working actors and performers, SAG-AFTRA\u2019s national board unanimously voted to issue a strike order against studios and streamers,\u201d SAG National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a press conference. \u201cUnion members should withhold their labor until a fair contract can be achieved,\u201d he told the room. \u201cThey have left us with no alternative.\u201d The strike comprising more than 150,000 television and movie actors will begin at midnight tonight, and picket lines will begin Friday morning. It is the first time since 1960 that both actors and writers have picketed film and television production companies. \u201cThe eyes of the world and, particularly, the eyes of labor are upon us,\u201d said Fran Drescher, star of the Nineties sitcom The Nanny who is now the actors\u2019 guild president. \u201cWhat happens to us is important. What\u2019s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor. When employers make Wall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the essential contributors who make the machine run, we have a problem.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe are being victimized by a very greedy enterprise. At some point, you have to say \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to take this anymore. You people are crazy. What are you doing? Why are you doing this?\u2019 \u201cThe entire business model has been changed by streaming and AI If we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in jeopardy. You cannot change the business model as much as it has been changed and not expect the contract to change too.\u201d In an emotional tirade against Hollywood studios, Drescher added: \u201cWake up and smell the coffee! We demand respect! You cannot exist without us!\u201d In response, the AMPTP, which represents the studios, says it presented a deal that offered \u201chistoric pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, and a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors\u2019 digital likenesses for SAG-AFTR members\u201d. \u201cA strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life,\u201d the organisation added. \u201cThe Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\u201d The actors\u2019 guild released a statement early Thursday announcing that negotiations with the AMPTP had proved inconclusive. News of the combined strike comes after the cast of Oppenheimer left the film\u2019s London premiere prematurely to \u201cgo and write their picket signs\u201d in preparation for the strike. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet,\u201d Nolan announced to the cinema\u2019s audience. \u201cUnfortunately, they\u2019re off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by Sag, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of the unions, and we support them.\u201d The acting union\u2019s demands are similar to those of its counterpart, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), whose members have been striking since May. Among the former\u2019s chief demands include increased wages, higher streaming residuals and improved working conditions.",
