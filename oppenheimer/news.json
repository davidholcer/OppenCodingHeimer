            "text": "13 July 2023 Matt Damon \u201cfell into a depression\u201d when he knew he wasn\u2019t making a great movie. Matt Damon fell into depression The \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 star \u2013 who has Isabella, 17, Gia, 13, and Stella, 12, with wife Luciana Barroso and is stepfather to 24-year-old Alexia \u2013 didn\u2019t name the production, but recalled the despair he felt at uprooting his family while he worked on a project that he realised mid-way through wasn\u2019t what he had \u201choped it would be\u201d. Speaking on YouTube channel \u2018Jake\u2019s Takes\u2019, he said: \u201cWithout naming any particular movies\u2026sometimes you find yourself in a movie that you know, perhaps, might not be what you had hoped it would be, and you\u2019re still making it. \u201cAnd I remember halfway through production and you\u2019ve still got months to go and you\u2019ve taken your family somewhere, you know, and you\u2019ve inconvenienced them, and I remember my wife pulling me up because I fell into a depression about like, what have I done?\u201d The 52-year-old actor\u2019s wife provided Matt with encouragement and urged him to just continue to be professional and do his best because there was little else he could do. He recalled: She just said, \u2018We\u2019re here now\u2019. \u201cYou know, and it was like\u2026 I do pride myself, in a large part because of her, at being a professional actor and what being a professional actor means is you go and you do the 15-hour day and give it absolutely everything, even in what you know is going to be a losing effort. \u201cAnd if you can do that with the best possible attitude, then you\u2019re a pro, and she really helped me with that.\u201d The \u2018Suburbicon\u2019 star previously admitted he knew \u2018The Great Wall\u2019 \u2013 in which he starred as a mercenary warrior imprisoned within the Great Wall of China before joining forces with the Chinese to combat an alien invasion \u2013 was a \u201cturkey\u201d while filming the 2016 movie and realised the project was doomed when he saw how the film\u2019s Hollywood backers were pressuring director Zhang Yimou to change his vision. Speaking to Marc Maron on his \u2018WTF\u2019 podcast, Matt said: \u201cI was like, this is exactly how disasters happen. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cohere. It doesn\u2019t work as a movie. \u201cI came to consider that the definition of a professional actor; knowing you\u2019re in a turkey and going, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got four more months. It\u2019s the up at dawn siege on Hamburger Hill. I am definitely going to die here, but I\u2019m doing it.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s as s***** as you can feel creatively, I think. I hope to never have that feeling again.\u201d",

            "text": "Emily Blunt assured fans she is not quitting her acting career after sharing in an interview that she was taking a step back from Hollywood. \u201cHonestly, that story got so, sort of, overblown,\u201d the actress told Deadline Thursday at the London premiere of her new film \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d \u201cI was just taking some downtime \u2014 not quitting Hollywood,\u201d she reiterated, adding that she was \u201cjust taking some months off to be with the kids.\u201d Blunt, 40, made headlines earlier this week when she revealed on a podcast that she planned to take a break from her job. \u201cThis year, I\u2019m not working. I worked quite a bit last year, and my oldest baby is 9, so we\u2019re in the last year of single digits,\u201d she said on iHeart\u2019s \u201cTable for Two with Bruce Bozzi\u201d Monday. Blunt \u2014 who shares daughters Hazel, 9, and Violet, 7, with her husband and fellow actor, John Krasinski \u2014 added that she feels that her children are at the ages where \u201cthere are cornerstones to their day\u201d that she doesn\u2019t want to miss. \u201cAnd it\u2019s, \u2018Will you wake me up? Will you take me to school? Will you pick me up? Will you put me to bed?\u2019 And I just need to be there for all of them for a good stretch. And I just felt that in my bones,\u201d she said. The \u201cDevil Wears Prada\u201d star explained that there is an \u201cemotional cost\u201d to her and her family when she is consumed with a project and that she is \u201cvery prone to guilt.\u201d \u201cI think maybe all mothers are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just prone to feeling bad for, God forbid, wanting something outside of being a mother.\u201d However, Blunt stressed that she supports working moms. \u201cI\u2019m a huge advocate for women being ambitious.

            "title": "Hollywood actors announce strike in first joint action with writers in 60 years",
            "text": "The union representing Hollywood actors formally announced a strike on Thursday, expanding the standoff between Hollywood workers and studio executives over wages, AI technology and how to divide the profits of the new digital streaming era. The strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) marks the first time in 63 years Hollywood writers and actors are striking simultaneously. Hollywood writers went on strike in early May. Now the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) will be joined by some of Sag-Aftra\u2019s 160,000 members. The simultaneous strikes are expected to halt the majority of Hollywood\u2019s film and TV production, and have major effects on the broader Los Angeles economy. With some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars on strike, press junkets for summer and fall movie premieres will be cancelled, and the Emmy Awards will likely be postponed. Workers across LA are gearing up to survive for weeks or months without wages. Members of both Sag-Aftra and WGA voted overwhelmingly to authorise a strike if needed, a sign of their growing frustrations with what actors and writers have described as shrinking compensation for their work as film and TV shows have increasingly moved to online streaming platforms, and rising fears of how the industry might try to replace creative workers of all kinds with AI technologies. [ Hollywood screenwriters strike: how will it affect what I can watch in Ireland? ] In recent weeks, Hollywood\u2019s top acting talent had made it clear they were willing to strike. In late June, a letter from Hollywood A-listers, including Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, urged their union leaders not to settle for a mediocre deal in what they saw as a historically important contract negotiation. Sag-Aftra and the studios had been negotiating for weeks, but failed to reach an agreement by the deadline of midnight on Wednesday. In a statement on Thursday, the actors\u2019 union said its negotiating committee had voted unanimously to recommend a strike, and that its national board would decide on the matter on Thursday morning. It said: \u201cAfter more than four weeks of bargaining, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) \u2013 the entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery \u2013 remains unwilling to offer a fair deal on the key issues that are essential to Sag-Aftra members.\u201d The Sag-Aftra president, Fran Drescher, said: \u201cThe companies have refused to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us. Until they do negotiate in good faith, we cannot begin to reach a deal. We have no choice but to move forward in unity, and on behalf of our membership, with a strike recommendation to our national board. The board will discuss the issue this morning and will make its decision.\u201d A strike is expected to have an immediate impact on publicity efforts for the summer\u2019s top films; the Thursday evening premiere of Oppenheimer in London has been moved to start an hour earlier so the cast can attend regardless of the outcome. Other major commercial films including Barbie and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One have already hosted their world premieres, though their stars will be restricted from participating in further promotional events. The strike might also delay the Emmy awards until late autumn, or even next year, industry publications reported. Disney has announced that a July 15th premiere of its movie Haunted Mansion will still take place at Disneyland regardless of the strikes, though the film\u2019s actors \u2013 including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish and Jamie Lee Curtis \u2013 will not be present. San Diego Comic-Con, scheduled to begin on July 20th, will be affected as well. [ Hollywood writers\u2019 strike is at once heartening and depressing ] Hollywood writers have been on strike since May 2nd. The beginning of that strike was marked by strong solidarity from Hollywood\u2019s other unionised workforces, including the powerful Teamsters\u2019 union, and Sag-Aftra members showed up in solidarity at Writers Guild of America picket lines, even before their own strike was called. Anonymous industry sources told Deadline this week that studio executives did not plan to resume negotiations with the striking writers until late October. \u201cThe endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses,\u201d an industry source was quoted as saying, with another saying the goal was to \u201cbreak the WGA\u201d. A spokesperson for the studios denied those anonymous claims, telling Deadline in a statement that the companies \u201care committed to reaching a deal\u201d. \u2013 Guardian",

            "title": "Hollywood Stars Go on Strike: Celebrities Walk Off the Job Bringing TV and Movie Production to a Historic Halt",
            "text": "Hollywood stars will walk off the job en masse Thursday night after the screen actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA failed to reach a new contract with studios, effectively bringing scripted TV and movie production around the country to a screeching halt. The actors\u2019 work stoppage comes as Hollywood writers are in the third month of their own strike, creating a highly unusual situation in the entertainment industry that could jeopardize thousands of jobs and wreak havoc on local economies stretching from California to Georgia. SAG-AFTRA\u2019s strike declaration Thursday followed the union\u2019s last-ditch effort to reach a compromise by agreeing to allow federal mediators into the talks. But union leaders still failed to make headway on issues including increased compensation in the age of digital streaming entertainment and guarantees that actors won\u2019t be replaced by artificial intelligence technology. Union leaders said in a statement Thursday that studios remain \u201cunwilling to offer a fair deal on the key issues that are essential to SAG-AFTRA members.\u201d The group representing the studios \u2014 the AMPTP \u2014 said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the failure to reach a deal. The specter of two simultaneous, prolonged strikes is potentially catastrophic for Hollywood, especially for traditional TV, which is still the bread and butter for legacy studios. The strikes are almost certain to hasten the medium\u2019s slow but certain demise as the lack of new content will cause more people to cut the cord. Streaming services could also be hit hard, since streaming requires a constant pipeline of new content to satisfy subscribers\u2019 bottomless viewing appetites. But streamers also have libraries of old but popular movies and TV series that can sustain them through the strikes. For Hollywood, the two strikes are sure to compound the economic woes of the major studios, which are in the midst of laying off thousands of employees in the face of a weak economy. Runaway inflation caused by President Joe Biden\u2019s economic policies has forced households to cut back on spending, leading to companies to spend less on advertising and thus hurting the bottom lines of media outlets across the board. At a moment when Hollywood\u2019s writers remain on strike, members of performers\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA will soon be mounting their own picket lines, constituting the first \u201cdouble strike\u201d involving both actors and scribes since 1960 https://t.co/C1VI1daRRD pic.twitter.com/P9XUp6NouO \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) July 13, 2023 SAG-AFTRA\u2019s National Board officially called an #ActorsStrike against major film and television companies as contract talks with studios and streamers broke down without a deal on July 12 https://t.co/C1VI1daRRD pic.twitter.com/6keqd4jeI1 \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) July 13, 2023 The Walt Disney Co. is in the process of laying off 7000 workers worldwide, while layoffs have also hit Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery. The writers strike has also led to layoffs at Hollywood talent agencies, which normally rely on commissions and fees from production deals. But with many studios refusing to greenlight projects amid all of the labor uncertainty, talent agencies are finding themselves with little to do. The SAG-AFTRA strike impacts all screen actors, ranging from millionaire A-list celebrities \u2014 Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, and Ben Stiller were among the earliest stars to support the walkout \u2014 to the extras who appear in commercials. The guild represents an estimated 160,000 actors as well as broadcast journalists. Studio movies in production that are likely to shut down include Paramount\u2019s Gladiator sequel, directed by Ridley Scott, and Warner Bros.\u2019 Juror #2, directed by Clint Eastwood. Even promotional activities for upcoming movies could feel the impact of the strike. Stars involved in Barbie, Oppenheimer, and the latest Mission: Impossible sequel face the possibility of being muzzled due to union rules. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher \u2014 the star of the 90s sitcom the The Nanny \u2014 said in a statement that the union \u201cnegotiated in good faith,\u201d but \u201cthe AMPTP\u2019s responses to the union\u2019s most important proposals have been insulting and disrespectful of our massive contributions to this industry.\u201d In the days leading up to the strike, more than 1,000 actors signed a letter to SAG-AFTRA leadership saying they were \u201cprepared to strike\u201d if the guild doesn\u2019t \u201cget all the way there\u201d during talks with the studios, according to a Deadline report. Drescher was reportedly among the signatories. Their demands include improved compensation, especially when it comes to streaming, as well as assurances surrounding the use of artificial intelligence technology.",

            "title": "What to know about the actors\u2019 strike",
            "text": "The union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors announced Thursday that it would go on strike at midnight, joining screenwriters who walked out in May and creating Hollywood\u2019s first industrywide shutdown in 63 years. Here is what you need to know. Why are the actors and writers striking? Pay is often at the center of work stoppages, and that is the case here. But the rise of streaming and the challenges created by the pandemic have stressed the studios, many of which are facing financial challenges, as well as actors and writers, who are seeking better pay and new protections in a rapidly changing workplace. Both actors and screenwriters have demanded increased residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services. Streaming series typically have far fewer episodes than television series typically did. And it used to be that if a television series was a hit, actors and writers could count on a long stream of regular residual checks; streaming has changed the system in a way that they say has hurt them. Both groups also want aggressive guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence to preserve jobs. A-list actors last month signed a letter to guild leadership saying they were ready to strike and calling this moment \u201can unprecedented inflection point in our industry.\u201d What is the position of the Hollywood studios? The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major studios and streamers, has said it offered \u201chistoric pay and residual increases\u201d as well as higher caps on pension and health contributions. They also say their offer includes audition protections, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d proposal on artificial intelligence and other benefits that address the union\u2019s concerns. The Hollywood studios have also stressed that all the industry upheaval has not been easy for them, either. As moviegoers have been slow to return to cinemas and home viewers have moved from cable and network television to streaming entertainment, many studios have watched their share prices plummet and their profit margins shrink. Some companies have resorted to layoffs or pulled the plug on projects \u2014 or both. What will happen to my TV shows and movies? It will take a while for filmgoers to notice a change, since most of the movies scheduled for release this year have already been shot. But TV viewers are already seeing the strike\u2019s effects, and if it drags on, popular shows could see their next seasons delayed. Late-night shows are already airing reruns because of the writers\u2019 strike, and the vast majority of TV and film productions have already shut down or paused production. Big name shows like \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d halted work after the writers\u2019 strike began; it is not yet clear if their upcoming seasons will be delayed. Disney announced several changes to its theatrical release calendar in June, amid the writers\u2019 strike. Now, the actors\u2019 strike will add even greater upheaval. During the first two weeks of July, no scripted TV permits were issued in Los Angeles County, according to FilmLA, which tracks production activity. Film and TV shows that have completed shooting and are already in postproduction can likely stay on schedule, because the work remaining does not typically involve writers or actors. Participating in either film or television production with any of the studios is now off the table, with few exceptions. And that means that within a few months \u2014 beginning with the fall lineup \u2014 viewers will begin to notice broader changes to their TV diet. The ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly lineups that include \u201cCelebrity Wheel of Fortune,\u201d \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and \u201cJudge Steve Harvey\u201d as well as repeats of \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d The Fox broadcast network\u2019s fall lineup includes unscripted series like \u201cCelebrity Name That Tune,\u201d \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d and \u201cKitchen Nightmares.\u201d How long could this all drag on? If only we knew. Writers have been walking the picket lines now for more than 70 days, and their union, the Writers Guild of America, has yet to return to bargaining with the studios. The last time the writers and actors went on strike at the same time was in 1960, when Ronald Reagan was president of the Screen Actors Guild. Screenwriters have walked out several times, sometimes for long periods: Their 2007 strike lasted 100 days. The actors last staged a major walkout in 1980; it lasted more than three months. What about the promotion of current shows and films? In the near term, officials have said there will be no promotion of current projects, either online or in person. Do not expect to hear Ryan Gosling touting \u201cBarbie\u201d again anytime soon. A ban on promotion could be very bad news for San Diego\u2019s Comic-Con, upcoming film festivals in places like Venice and Toronto, and scheduled movie premieres like the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d premiere planned for Monday in New York. The 75th Emmy Awards, which announced its nominations yesterday, might now be in peril. Organizers have already had discussions about postponing the Sept. 18 ceremony, likely by months.

The strike is set to go into effect at midnight PT Thursday night, but many actors have spoken about the impact it will have before it officially commenced.

            "title": "Like Emily Blunt, These Parents Took A Step Back From Work Due To The 'Emotional Cost'",
            "text": "Emily Blunt\u2019s revelation that she\u2019ll be taking a year out of acting to spend more time with her children is resonating a lot with parents \u2013 particularly mums in the UK. Blunt is married to Office actor John Krasinski, who she shares two daughters with: Hazel, nine, and Violet, seven. The actor, who stars in the soon-to-be-released Oppenheimer, appeared on the Table For Two podcast and spoke about how, after working a lot this past year, she realised it was time to take a step back because of \u201cthe emotional cost on me, on the kids, on balance.\u201d The 40-year-old added that she is also \u201cvery prone to guilt.\u201d \u201cI just feel there are cornerstones to their day that are so important when they\u2019re little. And it\u2019s, \u2018Will you wake me up? Will you take me to school? Will you pick me up? Will you put me to bed?\u2019 And I just need to be there for all of them \u2013 for a good stretch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just felt that in my bones.\u201d So many parents can relate to this all-consuming guilt when work takes up so much time, energy and mental space. Kirsten Scheider, 48, from St Albans, is one of them. The single mum used to run a successful event management company, which meant she could take her two boys on nice holidays and treat them to the luxuries of a financially-secure existence. But Kirsten was \u201con\u201d all the time and her sons were struggling with their own mental health issues. She was trying to support her youngest through a period of self-harm, eating disorders and suicidal ideation. \u201cTrying to fight for support took up all my time, energy and emotion, so I ended up working late into the night to make up for it,\u201d she tells HuffPost UK. \u201cI felt guilty all the time. I\u2019m a perfectionist and my clients would always get more than they paid for. I tried hard to be there for my children, too, but I watched them get more unwell and realised whatever I was doing it wasn\u2019t enough. It killed me inside.\u201d Marie Brown, 52, from Sevenoaks, can resonate strongly with this feeling of not doing anything to the best of her ability. She was a high-earner as the managing director at an investment bank but felt like she wasn\u2019t being the best employee, wife, or the kind of mum she wanted to be. She recalls the moment she decided enough was enough: \u201cThe summer before I quit I was sitting in a windowless meeting room debating a trivial issue with some banks whilst my nanny was spending the day in the sunshine at Leeds Castle with my children, my best friend and her children. \u201cThere had been a build-up to that point \u2013 and obviously there were days when being at work was preferable to the chores at home \u2013 but I do recall thinking, \u2018why am I here?\u2019. That was the point when I made up my mind to quit.\u201d She had major reservations about leaving her high-flying career, however \u2013 especially as she\u2019d invested a lot to get to the position she was in. She was worried about the message it sent to others, including her kids, who were seven and five at the time. \u201cI did feel guilty that I was letting down other women by quitting such a senior job and I didn\u2019t want my children to think the dad was the one who earned the money whilst the mum was the one at home cooking and looking after the children,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was quite a big issue for me \u2013 it still is.\u201d A massive 84% of the 1.75 million people who\u2019ve given up work to care for their family are women, according to ONS data. To fill the void when her kids were at school, Marie set up her own business at home \u2013 a web design company called Beyond The Kitchen Table. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have continued as I was, mentally,\u201d she admits. \u201cI would add I don\u2019t regret returning to work when my children were little ... I think the baby and toddler years would have driven me mad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there is a lot going on when they get to school age and I think they needed me then \u2013 and I needed to be with them.\u201d Marie says she now has a good relationship with her children, who are teens, and believes being there for them \u2013 working from home, doing the school run, being around for chats and football matches \u2013 has contributed a lot to this. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they would have turned out or what our relationship would have been like if I had continued in my city job,\u201d she adds. As for Kirsten, she decided to step away from events two years ago and became a personal trainer, who works from home and organises fitness retreats and adventure breaks. The switch \u2013 while a challenge, because she was earning less and having to build a different business from scratch \u2013 has been pivotal in her own wellbeing, as well as that of her sons. \u201cI have learned the hard way that you cannot pour from an empty cup. I am very good at looking after my own wellbeing now and I also see a therapist regularly to offload and get help dealing with things better,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has really helped all of us \u2013 my younger son is so much better and actively seeking 1:1 time with me, which I really love. He\u2019s quite an introvert but has started talking more about things that matter to him and I feel proud I have enabled this space for him. \u201cMy older boy started at uni last year and had terrible anxiety initially which we overcame together. He recently told me he could never imagine having a better mum and it made my day.\u201d She concludes: \u201cI have never been poorer and never been happier and my boys are doing really well.\u201d Help and support: Mind, open Monday to Friday, 9am-6pm on 0300 123 3393.Samaritans offers a listening service which is open 24 hours a day, on 116 123 (UK and ROI - this number is FREE to call and will not appear on your phone bill).CALM (the Campaign Against Living Miserably) offer a helpline open 5pm-midnight, 365 days a year, on 0800 58 58 58, and a webchat service.The Mix is a free support service for people under 25.

            "text": "Hollywood actors will join screenwriters in historic strike action after the national board of the SAG-AFTRA union approved a walkout by its members. Negotiators for the union had unanimously recommended a strike after talks with studios broke down. Scripted TV and movie production will cease immediately in the first dual work stoppage by both actors and writers in 63 years. The Writers Guild of America has been on strike since early May. Both groups demand increases in base pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus assurances that their work will not be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). Both unions are in dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Fran Drescher, former star of The Nanny and the president of SAG-AFTRA, said studios\u2019 responses to the actors\u2019 concerns had been \u201cinsulting and disrespectful\u201d. Issa Rae and Jamie Lee Curtis lead A-listers voicing support for the historic strike, while the cast of Oppenheimer left a London premiere prematurely on Thursday night to \u201cgo and write their picket signs\u201d in preparation for the \u201cimminent\u201d strike by the actors\u2019 union. Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger has condemned the threatened strike action as \u201cvery disruptive\u201d at the \u201cworst time\u201d as well as calling the expectations of writers and actors \u201cjust not realistic\u201d.",

The streaming companies, also referred to as OTT platforms, objected and no decision was reached, according to government minutes of the talks and an industry source who attended.The ministry \"highlighted concerns regarding obscene and vulgar content on OTT platforms, as expressed by Members of Parliament, citizen groups, and the general public,\" said the minutes, which are not public but were seen by Reuters.Netflix and Amazon have become hugely popular in India, which is set to grow into a $7 billion market for the sector by 2027, according to Media Partners Asia.Also Read: Hollywood strike: Studios boycott SDCC, 'Barbie', 'Oppenheimer' promotions impactedTop Bollywood stars feature in online material, some of which has faced criticism from lawmakers and the public for scenes deemed vulgar or offensive to religious sentiments.Though all films in Indian cinemas are reviewed and certified by a government-appointed board, streamed content is not.Officials in the meeting asked the industry to consider an independent panel to review content so that unsuitable material could be weeded out, two people who attended said.The industry objected but the officials asked them to consider the idea, they added.The government highlighted the need for a \"more proactive approach\" to ensure that streaming content, \"including international content\", aligns with a so-called code of ethics, the minutes showed.That code already mandates providers to exercise caution on content that could incite violence or be sensitive for religious reasons.The meeting was attended by Amazon AMZN.O, Disney, Netflix, Reliance's RELI.NS broadcast unit, Viacom18, and Apple AAPL.O TV.The companies and the ministry did not respond to requests for comments.'PROPAGATE VULGARITY'The discussions signal growing scrutiny of India's fast-growing streaming market.The proposal also comes as streaming giants protest a government order to add 50-second tobacco health warnings in each piece of content, and two years after India ordered the setting up self-regulatory bodies for complaints about streaming content.Industry executives say India's streaming regulations are among the world's most stringent.At an April event, when the government agreed to a partnership with Amazon to promote film and television, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said streaming platforms should \"not propagate vulgarity and abuse camouflaged as creative expression\".Thakur has said complaints about obscene content were increasing and the government was willing to change regulations if need be to address the problem.Indian officials also proposed at the meeting the formation of an expert panel to set age ratings, instead of platforms doing that themselves, one of the attendees said.The platforms said they would ensure strong parental controls and \"special care would be taken in respect of suitability of the international content\", the minutes showed.Suhasini Maniratnam of the Digital Publisher Content Grievance Council, told the gathering pre-censorship could hurt the industry growth and cost jobs, and that given the high volume of content \"there is a need to specifically act\" against obscene and vulgar content.Also Read: Audience has the power to reject vulgarity on OTT, says Prasoon Joshi--- ENDS",

            "title": "Hollywood actors strike: what we need to know and what will happen?",
            "text": "The union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors announced Thursday that it would go on strike at midnight, joining screenwriters who walked out in May and creating Hollywood\u2019s first industry shutdown in 63 years. Here is what you need to know. Why are the actors and writers striking? Pay is often at the centre of work stoppages, and that is the case here. But the rise of streaming and the challenges created by the pandemic have stressed the studios, many of which are facing financial challenges, as well as actors and writers, who are seeking better pay and new protections in a rapidly changing workplace. Actors and screenwriters have demanded increased residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services. Streaming series typically have far fewer episodes than television series typically did. And it used to be that if a television series was a hit, actors and writers could count on a long stream of regular residual checks; streaming has changed the system in a way that they say has hurt them. The groups also want aggressive guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence to preserve jobs. [ Hollywood writers\u2019 strike is at once heartening and depressing ] A-list actors last month signed a letter to guild leadership saying they were ready to strike and calling this moment \u201can unprecedented inflection point in our industry\u201d. What is the position of the Hollywood studios? The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents big studios and streamers, has said it offered \u201chistoric pay and residual increases\u201d as well as higher caps on pension and health contributions. They also say their offer includes audition protections, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d proposal on artificial intelligence and other benefits that address the union\u2019s concerns. The Hollywood studios have also stressed that all the industry upheaval has not been easy for them, either. As moviegoers have been slow to return to cinemas and home viewers have moved from cable and network television to streaming entertainment, many studios have watched their share prices plummet and their profit margins shrink. Some companies have resorted to lay-offs or pulled the plug on projects \u2013 or both. What will happen to my TV shows and movies? It will take a while for filmgoers to notice a change, since most of the movies scheduled for release this year have already been shot. But TV viewers are already seeing the strike\u2019s effects, and if it drags on, popular shows could see their next seasons delayed. Late-night shows are already airing reruns because of the writers\u2019 strike, and the vast majority of TV and film productions have already shut down or paused production. Big name shows like \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d halted work after the writers\u2019 strike began; it is not yet clear if their upcoming seasons will be delayed. Disney announced several changes to its theatrical release calendar in June, amid the writers\u2019 strike. Now, the actors\u2019 strike will add even greater upheaval. During the first two weeks of July, no scripted TV permits were issued in Los Angeles County, says FilmLA, which tracks production activity. Film and TV shows that have completed shooting and are already in post-production is likely to stay on schedule, because the work remaining does not typically involve writers or actors. Participating in either film or television production with any of the studios is now off the table, with few exceptions. And that means that within a few months \u2013 beginning with the fall line-up \u2013 viewers will begin to notice broader changes to their TV diet. The ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly line-ups that include \u201cCelebrity Wheel of Fortune,\u201d \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and \u201cJudge Steve Harvey\u201d as well as repeats of \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d The Fox broadcast network\u2019s fall line-up includes unscripted series like \u201cCelebrity Name That Tune,\u201d \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d and \u201cKitchen Nightmares.\u201d How long could this all drag on? If only we knew. Writers have been walking the picket lines now for more than 70 days, and their union, the Writers Guild of America, has yet to return to bargaining with the studios. The last time the writers and actors went on strike at the same time was in 1960 when Ronald Reagan was president of the Screen Actors Guild. Screenwriters have walked out several times, sometimes for long periods: Their 2007 strike lasted 100 days. The actors last staged a walkout in 1980; it lasted more than three months. What about the promotion of current shows and films? In the near term, officials have said there will be no promotion of current projects, either online or in person. Do not expect to hear Ryan Gosling touting \u201cBarbie\u201d again anytime soon. A ban on promotion could be very bad news for San Diego\u2019s Comic-Con, upcoming film festivals in places like Venice and Toronto, and scheduled movie premieres like the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d premiere planned for Monday in New York. The 75th Emmy Awards, which announced its nominations yesterday, might now be in peril. Organisers have already had discussions about postponing the Sept. 18 ceremony, probably by months. \u2014 This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

While promoting his latest project, set for release July 21, Damon looked back at a time when he didn\u2019t have full confidence in one particular project during an interview on \u201cJake\u2019s Takes.\u201d \u201cI think, without naming any particular movies, that sometimes you find yourself in a movie that you know perhaps might not be what you had hoped it would be and you\u2019re still making it,\u201d the 52-year-old said. Damon credited his wife, Luciana Barroso, for encouraging him to see the movie through. \u201cAnd I remember halfway through production and you\u2019ve still got months to go and you\u2019ve taken your family somewhere, you know, and you\u2019ve inconvenienced them, and I remember my wife pulling me up because I fell into a depression about like, what have I done?\u201d \u201cShe just said, \u2018We\u2019re here now\u2019,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou know, and it was like\u2026I do pride myself, in a large part because of her, at being a professional actor and what being a professional actor means is you go and you do the 15-hour day and give it absolutely everything, even in what you know is going to be a losing effort.\u201d \u201cAnd if you can do that with the best possible attitude, then you\u2019re a pro, and she really helped me with that,\u201d he added. While the Oscar winner didn\u2019t name the movie in question, he previously opened up about a past project he was convinced was going to be a flop. Speaking about the 2016 film \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d which received a woeful 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, Damon likened the film to a disaster.

            "text": "Hollywood actors will join screenwriters in historic strike action after the national board of the SAG-AFTRA union approved a walkout by its members. Negotiators for the union had unanimously recommended a strike after talks with studios broke down. Scripted TV and movie production will cease immediately in the first dual work stoppage by both actors and writers in 63 years. The Writers Guild of America has been on strike since early May. Both groups demand increases in base pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus assurances that their work will not be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). Both unions are in dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Fran Drescher, former star of The Nanny and the president of SAG-AFTRA, said studios\u2019 responses to the actors\u2019 concerns had been \u201cinsulting and disrespectful\u201d. Issa Rae and Jamie Lee Curtis lead A-listers voicing support for the historic strike, while the cast of Oppenheimer left a London premiere prematurely on Thursday night to \u201cgo and write their picket signs\u201d in preparation for the \u201cimminent\u201d strike by the actors\u2019 union. Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger has condemned the threatened strike action as \u201cvery disruptive\u201d at the \u201cworst time\u201d as well as calling the expectations of writers and actors \u201cjust not realistic\u201d.",

            "title": "Hollywood shuts down as actors go on strike \u2013 The Frontier Post",
            "text": "LOS ANGELES (AFP): Tens of thousands of Hollywood actors will go on strike at midnight Thursday, effectively bringing the giant movie and television business to a halt as they join writers in the first industry-wide walkout for 63 years. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) issued a strike order after last-ditch talks with studios on their demands over dwindling pay and the threat posed by artificial intelligence ended without a deal. \u201cThis is a moment of history, a moment of truth \u2014 if we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble,\u201d SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher told a press conference, following the union board\u2019s unanimous vote to strike. \u201cWe are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines and big business.\u201d After the strike formally goes into effect at 0700 GMT Friday, actors will join writers on picket lines in the first Hollywood double strike since 1960. Writers have already spent 11 weeks protesting outside the headquarters of the likes of Disney and Netflix, after their similar demands were not met. With the shutdown of nearly all productions and film sets, popular television series face lengthy delays. Movie studios have already begun reshuffling their calendars, and if the strikes drag on, major film releases could be postponed too. A strike immediately prevents actors from promoting some of the year\u2019s biggest releases, at the peak of the movie industry\u2019s summer blockbuster season. The cast of hotly awaited new film \u201cOppenheimer\u201d walked out of the glitzy London premiere in solidarity with the strike. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a critical time at this point in the industry and the issues that are involved need to be addressed \u2014 there are difficult conversations,\u201d British actor Kenneth Branagh said on the red carpet just before the strike was announced. \u201cI know everybody\u2019s trying to get a fair deal, that\u2019s what\u2019s required, so we\u2019ll support that.\u201d \u2013 \u2018Greedy entity\u2019 \u2013 SAG-AFTRA represents some 160,000 actors \u2014 everyone from A-list stars such as Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Glenn Close to day players who do small roles on television series. The last time the actors\u2019 union went on strike, in 1980, it lasted more than three months. This time, some 98 percent of members voted to pre-approve industrial action if a deal was not reached. \u201cWe are the victims here. We are being victimized by a very greedy entity,\u201d said Drescher. \u201cI am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us.\u201d The union said in a statement after talks collapsed that actors\u2019 pay had been \u201cseverely eroded by the rise of the streaming ecosystem,\u201d and warned that \u201cartificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions.\u201d Actors say their salaries have been slashed, and that payments they used to receive when successful shows or films they had starred in were rerun on television have disappeared, because streamers refused to disclose their audience figures. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers said it had offered \u201chistoric\u201d pay rises and a \u201cgroundbreaking AI proposal\u201d to actors, who had chosen \u201ca path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\u201d Disney CEO Bob Iger on Thursday told CNBC the actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 expectations were \u201cnot realistic,\u201d calling the decision to strike \u201cvery disturbing.\u201d But Phil Lord \u2014 the writer, director and producer behind hits such as \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d \u2014 was among those in Hollywood pouring scorn on the studios\u2019 version of events. \u201cAMPTP has played hardball instead of helping to solve entirely solvable problems that endanger writers and actors on the lower ends of the pay scale,\u201d he tweeted. \u2013 \u2018Painful\u2019 \u2013 While the writers\u2019 strike has already dramatically reduced the number of movies and shows in production, an actors\u2019 walkout shutters almost everything. Some reality TV, animation and talk shows could continue. \u201cI feel sad and it is painful and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d said actress and SAG-AFTRA member Jennifer Van Dyck, on the picket line in New York on Thursday. \u201cThey are making so much money, and they say that we are not approaching this issue fairly\u2026. no one wants to go on strike, but there\u2019s just no way we can proceed.\u201d As well as requesting higher pay to counteract inflation, actors and writers are united on demands for guarantees about the use of artificial intelligence. SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland slammed the studios\u2019 latest stance on AI. He told journalists that studios had proposed to be allowed to scan the faces of background performers \u2014 or extras \u2014 for the payment of one day\u2019s work, and be able to own and use their likeness \u201cfor the rest of eternity, in any project they want, with no consent and no compensation.\u201d \u201cIf you think that\u2019s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "Remember when a new television season started in September? Not this year. Looking forward to big-budget blockbusters coming to a theater near you next summer? Maybe not. You\u2019ve always heard great things about \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d or \u201cThe Wire\u201d but you never got around to watching it? Or maybe something more recent like the \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d which just got nominated for more than two-dozen Emmy awards? Now\u2019s your chance. And by the way, it might be a while before you know how many of those Emmys \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d eventually takes home. The awards show, as with much in the TV and movie industry, is also very much uncertain right now. But what you can count on is more reality shows, and maybe game shows, and probably more opportunity to binge shows that have already been on your favourite streaming service. That\u2019s because about 160,000 actors who belong to SAG-AFTRA are about to go on strike, joining more than 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America who have been on strike since May 2. PREPPING FOR THE LONG-HAUL Some movies are already complete, of course, like \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and set to hit theatres. And, like automakers or other manufacturers who might try to build extra inventory ahead of strike deadlines, some streaming services have been preparing for these strikes by stockpiling new movies and shows to roll out. \u201cWe had to make plans for the worst. And so we do have a pretty robust slate of releases to take us into a long time,\u201d Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in April, just before the start of the writers strike. But that pipeline of new shows is already slowing to a trickle. Data from film permits in California indicates that production of most shows and movies already has been halted by the writers strike. Even though movies typically have a script in hand when they start shooting, revisions and changes mean a writer is usually needed while production proceeds. Now with actors also going on strike, most remaining production will stop. The exception will be independent movies that are not associated with one of the major studios. One group of television shows that will continue to produce new episodes is the traditional daytime soap operas. The writers of those shows are typically nonunion, and the unionized actors work under a different contract than the one that expired at 11:59 p.m. PDT on Wednesday. But most other actors will stop working as soon as the union\u2019s government board votes to go on strike later Thursday. Rank-and-file members have already voted 98 per cent in favour of authorizing a strike. Actors will not be doing publicity for movies that are being released, including appearing on the red carpet at movie premieres or doing interviews on podcasts. Of course, the writers strike brought an immediate halt to new episodes of U.S. late night shows, so the opportunity to do that sort of publicity was already limited. HOW LONG WILL IT LAST? What isn\u2019t clear is how long this will continue. There are hopes by some in the industry that since writers and actors are out at the same time, that will put pressure on the studios and streaming services to improve their offers and get everyone back to work sooner rather than later. The last time the writers and the Screen Actors Guild, the precursor of SAG-AFTRA, were on strike at the same time was 1960 \u2014 so long ago that Ronald Reagan was the SAG president leading that strike. But everyone agrees the industry is going through unprecedented change as the ways that the public consumes shows are changing rapidly, and the economics are changing with it. Disney CEO Bob Iger didn\u2019t seem to suggest there will be a solution in the near term, in comments Thursday morning. \u201cThey are adding to a set of challenges this business is already facing that is quite frankly very disruptive,\u201d said Iger, who is set to receive more than US$25 million in compensation this year, about SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild in an interview on CNBC. \u201cYou have to be realistic about the business environment and what this business can deliver.\u201d But the unions say their members are suffering because of the changes in the business, like the shrinking amount of broadcast residuals in the age of streaming, and they\u2019ve been pushed to the point where they can\u2019t accept what the studios and streaming services are offering. \u201cThe studios and streamers have implemented massive unilateral changes in our industry\u2019s business model, while at the same time insisting on keeping our contracts frozen in amber,\u201d said a statement from Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union\u2019s chief negotiator, issued early Thursday morning. \u201cThe studios and streamers have underestimated our members\u2019 resolve, as they are about to fully discover.\u201d So don\u2019t expect to see the return of many of your favourite shows any time soon.",

            "text": "Hollywood actors are joining screenwriters in the first dual strike from the two unions in more than six decades, with huge consequences for the film and television industry. Here is a look at how it has played out, why it's happening, and what could come next. WHAT LED TO THE ACTORS STRIKE? More than a month of talks on a new three-year contract between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the studios, streaming services and production companies that employ them led to little progress, and the tone became openly hostile in the days before union leaders voted to begin a strike on Friday. A last minute intervention from a federal mediator didn't bridge the gap. Union leaders say the streaming model that has taken over the industry in recent years has cheated actors of their share of income and funneled money to executives, and proposals of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, streamers and production companies in negotiations, did not even begin to meet their needs. A 12-day extension of the contract and the talks shortly before an initial deadline in late June brought some hope a deal would be reached, but the hostility only grew. \"The Nanny\u201d star Fran Drescher, who heads the union said it made them \u201cfeel like we\u2019d been duped, like maybe it was just to let studios promote their summer movies for another 12 days.\u201d Before the talks began, the 65,000 actors who cast ballots voted overwhelmingly for union leaders to send them into a strike, as the Writers Guild of America did when their deal expired more than two months ago. WHAT DO THE ACTORS WANT? For decades, an actor who appeared on a popular TV show like \u201cSeinfeld\u201d or \u201cThe Office\u201d even once could count on getting royalty checks when the show appeared in reruns, bringing pay even at times they were unable to find work. The streaming model has largely dried up that income, with residual payments untethered from a show or movie's popularity. Actors want a long-term share of that revenue. The issue is one of many the actors have in common with writers. For both scribes and performers, the move to streaming and its ripple effects have also meant shorter seasons of shows with longer gaps between them, and therefore less work. They say inflation is outpacing the scheduled pay bumps in their contracts. And both writers and actors fear the threat of unregulated use of artificial intelligence. The actors say studios want to be able to use their likenesses without having to hire them, or pay them. Actors also say they're contending with the new and increasing burden of self-taped auditions \u2014 the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and productions. The AMPTP said it presented actors a generous deal that included the biggest bump in minimum pay in 35 years and \u201ca groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors\u2019 digital likenesses.\u201d They say the union has \"regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\u201d WHAT WILL STRIKING MEAN FOR ACTORS? Union rules say actors are not to do any part of their jobs, which go far beyond actually shooting films and TV shows. They are not allowed to make personal appearances or promote their work on podcasts or at premieres. They are barred from doing any production work including auditions, readings, rehearsals, voiceovers or wardrobe fittings. Newly minted Emmy nominees can't publicly make their case for votes, nor appear at the ceremony, which is planned for September but is likely to be seriously scaled back or delayed. They are instead expected to spend their days on picket lines, outside the corporate headquarters and production hubs of studios. While big names including Matt Damon, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jessica Chastain have spoken out in favor of the strike and are likely to be the face of the picketing, SAG also includes tens of thousands of actors who struggle to find work and maintain income. More serious financial hardship likely lies ahead for them. WHAT EFFECT WILL THE COMBINED STRIKES HAVE FOR VIEWERS? Actors joining writers on strike will force nearly every U.S.-based show or film that hasn\u2019t already been shut down into hiatus. Forthcoming seasons of television shows are likely to be delayed indefinitely, and some movie releases will pushed back. (Don't worry, the July 21 box-office showdown between \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is still on.) The writers' strike had an almost instant effect on late-night network talk shows, including NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201c Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d and CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" which all went on hiatus immediately. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d axed its last three episodes of the season. In the two months since, many scripted television series have also shut down, including Netflix's \u201cStranger Things,\u201d Max's \u201cHacks,\" Showtime's \u201cYellow Jackets,\u201d and Apple TV+'s \u201cSeverance.\u201d It may take longer to notice the actors' strike on the streaming menus on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, though lovers of those outlets' original series will eventually have to wait longer than usual for their favorites to return. Shoots outside the U.S., where different unions and contracts operate, can continue, as the British-based \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d will for HBO, though the strike is likely to have a secondary drag on those too. And reality shows, game shows and most daytime talk shows will likely be unaffected. HOW LONG MIGHT ALL THIS GO ON? It's anyone's guess. After two months, there are no talks planned or imminent for the Writers Guild. The longest previous writers' strike, in 1988, lasted five months. The most recent one, in 2007 and 2008, went on for about three months, as did the most recent actors' strike in 1980. With both sides on strike together for the first time since 1960, and both facing so many of the same issues, they might find themselves jointly out of work for a long time.",

            "text": "A Massachusetts Democrat is calling on the U.S. to pass legislation that would keep artificial intelligence away from nuclear power. On Thursday, Sen. Edward Markey said, \"78 years ago this weekend, Robert Oppenheimer witnessed the world\u2019s first nuclear weapons explosion. In 2023, we face a new kind of nuclear threat: the militarization of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence systems.\" \"We must pass legislation to keep AI away from the nuclear button before it\u2019s too late,\" he asserted. Markey's office said he filed over a dozen amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act, including language that would prohibit the use of AI in the U.S. military's nuclear launch decisions. LAWMAKERS RATTLED BY AI-LAUNCHED NUKES, DEMAND \u2018HUMAN CONTROL\u2019 IN DEFENSE POLICY BILL Additionally, the office said the amendments would advance nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation and save billions in federal dollars by shifting wasteful spending from nuclear weapons development to vaccine research. One amendment is based on the Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Act, which would prohibit AI from making nuclear launch decisions. Markey and bipartisan Reps. Ted Lieu, Don Beyer and Ken Buck introduced the legislation in April. AI BANNED FROM RUNNING NUCLEAR MISSILE SYSTEMS UNDER BIPARTISAN BILL \"We need to keep humans in the loop on making life or death decisions to use deadly force, especially for our most dangerous weapons,\" Markey said then. \"While U.S. military use of AI can be appropriate for enhancing national security purposes, use of AI for deploying nuclear weapons without a human chain of command and control is reckless, dangerous, and should be prohibited,\" said Buck, R-Colo. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Their bill would codify existing Pentagon policy that requires a human to be \"in the loop\" for any decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons. In its fiscal year 2024 budget, the Pentagon is calling for $1.8 billion solely toward research and development of AI capabilities. Fox News' Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report.",

            "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood actors are joining screenwriters in the first dual strike from the two unions in more than six decades, with huge consequences for the film and television industry. Here is a look at how it has played out, why it\u2019s happening, and what could come next. More than a month of talks on a new three-year contract between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the studios, streaming services and production companies that employ them led to little progress, and the tone became openly hostile in the days before union leaders voted to begin a strike on Friday. A last minute intervention from a federal mediator didn\u2019t bridge the gap. Union leaders say the streaming model that has taken over the industry in recent years has cheated actors of their share of income and funneled money to executives, and proposals of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, streamers and production companies in negotiations, did not even begin to meet their needs. A 12-day extension of the contract and the talks shortly before an initial deadline in late June brought some hope a deal would be reached, but the hostility only grew. \u201cThe Nanny\u201d star Fran Drescher, who heads the union said it made them \u201cfeel like we\u2019d been duped, like maybe it was just to let studios promote their summer movies for another 12 days.\u201d Before the talks began, the 65,000 actors who cast ballots voted overwhelmingly for union leaders to send them into a strike, as the Writers Guild of America did when their deal expired more than two months ago. For decades, an actor who appeared on a popular TV show like \u201cSeinfeld\u201d or \u201cThe Office\u201d even once could count on getting royalty checks when the show appeared in reruns, bringing pay even at times they were unable to find work. The streaming model has largely dried up that income, with residual payments untethered from a show or movie\u2019s popularity. Actors want a long-term share of that revenue. The issue is one of many the actors have in common with writers. For both scribes and performers, the move to streaming and its ripple effects have also meant shorter seasons of shows with longer gaps between them, and therefore less work. They say inflation is outpacing the scheduled pay bumps in their contracts. And both writers and actors fear the threat of unregulated use of artificial intelligence. The actors say studios want to be able to use their likenesses without having to hire them, or pay them. Actors also say they\u2019re contending with the new and increasing burden of self-taped auditions \u2014 the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and productions. The AMPTP said it presented actors a generous deal that included the biggest bump in minimum pay in 35 years and \u201ca groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors\u2019 digital likenesses.\u201d They say the union has \u201cregrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\u201d Union rules say actors are not to do any part of their jobs, which go far beyond actually shooting films and TV shows. They are not allowed to make personal appearances or promote their work on podcasts or at premieres. They are barred from doing any production work including auditions, readings, rehearsals, voiceovers or wardrobe fittings. Newly minted Emmy nominees can\u2019t publicly make their case for votes, nor appear at the ceremony, which is planned for September but is likely to be seriously scaled back or delayed. They are instead expected to spend their days on picket lines, outside the corporate headquarters and production hubs of studios. While big names including Matt Damon, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jessica Chastain have spoken out in favor of the strike and are likely to be the face of the picketing, SAG also includes tens of thousands of actors who struggle to find work and maintain income. More serious financial hardship likely lies ahead for them. Actors joining writers on strike will force nearly every U.S.-based show or film that hasn\u2019t already been shut down into hiatus. Forthcoming seasons of television shows are likely to be delayed indefinitely, and some movie releases will pushed back. (Don\u2019t worry, the July 21 box-office showdown between \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is still on.) The writers\u2019 strike had an almost instant effect on late-night network talk shows, including NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201c Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d and CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d which all went on hiatus immediately. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d axed its last three episodes of the season. In the two months since, many scripted television series have also shut down, including Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things,\u201d Max\u2019s \u201cHacks,\u201d Showtime\u2019s \u201cYellow Jackets,\u201d and Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cSeverance.\u201d It may take longer to notice the actors\u2019 strike on the streaming menus on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, though lovers of those outlets\u2019 original series will eventually have to wait longer than usual for their favorites to return. Shoots outside the U.S., where different unions and contracts operate, can continue, as the British-based \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d will for HBO, though the strike is likely to have a secondary drag on those too. And reality shows, game shows and most daytime talk shows will likely be unaffected. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. After two months, there are no talks planned or imminent for the Writers Guild. The longest previous writers\u2019 strike, in 1988, lasted five months. The most recent one, in 2007 and 2008, went on for about three months, as did the most recent actors\u2019 strike in 1980. With both sides on strike together for the first time since 1960, and both facing so many of the same issues, they might find themselves jointly out of work for a long time. SHARE",

            "title": "DAVID MARCUS: A-list actors flounce out on a strike led anti-capitalist who's worth millions",
            "text": "Superstar Hollywood actors are playing a new role this week - oppressed workers on strike. Ben Affleck as Batman was more believable. That's right, multi-millionaire thespians have gone from preening on red carpets to decrying corrupt capitalist movie studios, as they join the first artiste work stoppage in 60 years. It's exactly as absurd as it sounds. The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) are allying with the Screenwriters Guild, who began pounding the picket line back in May. Among the demands of the elitist set is more money (of course) and protections against Artificial Intelligence recreating their beautiful faces and stealing their jobs. Good luck fighting the future. On the other side is The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates for the studios and says they're offering the highest minimum pay raises in 35 years and 'ground-breaking' job security against AI actors. None of it is enough. So yes, Tinseltown is shutting down. But who will pay the price for these puffed-up celebrities pantomiming poor and abused workers? Spoiler alert: It won't be them. In a ludicrous display of faux solidarity with the workers of the world, the cast of the new blockbuster movie 'Oppenheimer,' including Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, left their London premiere early. But only after first being feted as Hollywood royalty by snapping paparazzi. What stunning bravery! What remarkable self-restraint\u2026 and denial! Though maybe it really was the ultimate sacrifice for these narcissists to deny themselves the pleasure of gazing at giant images of their own faces for the three-hour, run-time of this epic. Not to be upstaged, Fran Drescher, former star of the hit sitcom The Nanny and current SGA president, went into full freak out mode in a news conference on Thursday. 'We are the victims here,' she cried. It wasn't exactly Fran Fine shrill, but it was close. 'We are being victimized by a very greedy entity.' Excuse me, while I throw up into my popcorn bucket. This the same woman, who back in 2020 said, 'Capitalism has become another word for Ruling Class Elite!' Calm down, Cesar Chavez. If you're a victim, can we all get in on it? This is the same Fran Drescher with a net worth somewhere in the very fancy neighborhood of $25 million. Funny how capitalism didn't seem to bother her when a TV career, largely driven by her annoying voice, was making her fabulously wealthy. So, Fran. Aren't you tainted too? Beyond all of this obvious hypocrisy is an even more nauseating omission. Have any of these preening elites of the silver screen spared a moment of thought for the hard-working people, who just watched their jobs go 'poof.' Yes, there are 'strike funds' that offer help to some of those toiling behind the scenes. The Writers Guild has its own $20 million pot to dip into. The International Cinematographers Guild is building a fund of between $250,000 and $500,000 to give a thousand bucks to camera operators put out of work. These are people worried about buying groceries, not multimillion dollar homes. But what of the galaxy of workers who provide movie set support services? What of the caterers who feed the crew and truck drivers of logistics companies? How about electricians, carpenters, or the people who do the laundry? For the private jet set, with their adoring entourages, these little people might as well not even exist. Perhaps most appalling of all is the actors' union's threat toward non-union entertainers. The message is clear: cross the picket line and your career is over. In a memo warning potential SCABS, SAG-AFTRA wrote that, 'Any non-member seeking future membership\u2026who performs\u2026for a struck company during the strike will not be admitted\u2026' in the future. A concerned father took to Twitter to ask if his aspiring actor son, who has an agent but is non-union, is permitted under the dictates of this powerful coalition, to attend a big audition next week. The answer seemed to be: no! Sorry kid. Your big screen dream is over until Florence Pugh gets paid! At a time when so many Americans are struggling financially and in need of some entertainment, this absurd stunt by over-privileged prancing performers is as tone deaf as a modern pop star without autotuning. The most likely outcome of their farcical fight for 'workers rights' is more reality television, less opportunity for original storytelling, and ironically, more reliance on AI. The loud and clear message that should be sent to these ungrateful celebrities and their continent-sized senses of entitlement must be, 'get back to work or get out of the way.' Go back to your trailer, put on your makeup, and make some movies. No one is buying it as you cry poverty from your infinity pools in the Hollywood Hills. Real people with real lives, who have kids and mortgages are going to suffer. And let these pompous performers be warned: The more these elite hypocrites whine and rend their Versace, the less likely Americans will be willing to welcome them back into their living rooms.",

            "title": "The Hollywood actors\u2019 strike: everything you need to know",
            "text": "Who is on strike? The strike was called on Thursday morning by US actors\u2019 union Sag-Aftra (which was formed in 2012 after a merger between the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists), after the breakdown in negotiations with the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers), which represents the studio bosses. Sag-Aftra has around 160,000 members: actors in film and TV shows, as well as video game performers, radio presenters, models and YouTube influencers. Technically the union only covers the US, but its Global Rule One demands that members pull out of any production anywhere in the world. Who is Sag-Aftra\u2019s firebrand leader?The union\u2019s president and figurehead is Fran Drescher, who you might remember from 90s TV show The Nanny. Having faced down a modicum of criticism for shooting off to Italy for a photoshoot with Kim Kardashian as negotiations were heading for the rocks, Drescher stormed back with an incendiary speech, in which she poured scorn on studio bosses (\u201cThey plead poverty, that they\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them.\u201d) and invoked the spirit of the French Revolution: \u201cEventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles, and then it\u2019s over!\u201d Who are the major supporting players? A preview of the A-listers putting their star-wattage behind the strike came a fortnight ago when a Sag-Aftra letter expressing willingness to strike was signed by the likes of Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron, Joaquin Phoenix, Jamie Lee Curtis, Olivia Wilde and Ewan McGregor. On Friday, George Clooney added his weight to the strike, calling it \u201can inflection point in our industry\u201d, and saying that change was required for \u201cour industry to survive\u201d. Other big hitters to lend their support over the past 24 hours include John Cusack and Mark Ruffalo. There have been no holdouts \u2013 all US actors appear to be on board with the action. What does Sag-Aftra want? And why can\u2019t they get it? One of the union\u2019s main roles is to negotiate terms with the studios: the last major agreement was signed in July 2020 though it was almost immediately undermined by Covid. That agreement was due to expire on 30 June, hence the start of negotiations. One of the main sticking points appears to be residuals, the payments that performers receive for repeat showings of films or TV shows, while the issue of who owns an actor\u2019s likeness if it is reproduced by AI is also a major flashpoint. Sag-Aftra negotiators are demanding residuals partly based on viewership levels on streaming services but the studios \u2013 which include streamers Netflix and Amazon alongside Disney \u2013 aren\u2019t willing to share the information. Has streaming changed everything? Streaming hasn\u2019t just killed the mid-budget movie, or the linear TV series, it\u2019s also changed the way films and shows are presented to their audience, and extract money from them in return. Streamers make money from subscribers, and the shows and films are essentially promos for the subscriptions. Plus they are just up there permanently, with no \u201crepeats\u201d as we would understand them \u2013 classic \u201cdisruption\u201d, which makes it hard for traditional means of assessing their value in terms of paying people for them. Hence the argument over residuals, made all the harder by the streamers\u2019 reluctance to reveal how many people watch them. As shows and films on streaming platforms become ever larger and more widely watched, then the potential residuals become an ever more significant amount. What about AI? Six months ago, no one gave AI a second thought, but that\u2019s how fast things have moved: from zero to an existential threat. Right now, AI-generated imagery doesn\u2019t seem quite sophisticated enough to replace traditional film-making wholesale, but the speed of machine-learning has got everyone worried. The AMPTP said it had offered a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d proposal over AI, but Sag-Aftra\u2019s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland batted that one away: \u201cThey proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day\u2019s pay, and their companies should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity on any project they want, with no consent and no compensation. So if you think that\u2019s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again.\u201d I thought actors were rich, though? Acting is a bit like the sports world: there\u2019s a bunch of big-money headliners, and then the rest, some of whom earn decent money, but most are on nothing like it. These are the people on whose behalf Tom Cruise went ballistic during the Mission: Impossible shoot: \u201cYou can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down! It\u2019s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education!\u201d Matt Damon reminded reporters of the struggles of most US working actors\u2019 lives: \u201cIt\u2019s $26,000 to qualify for health coverage and a lot of people are on the margins and residual payments are getting them across that threshold. This isn\u2019t an academic exercise. This is real life-and-death stuff.\u201d Will they get what they want? How strong are the unions? The US might be the home of the labour-dispute massacre (about 1,100 deaths since 1850, by Wikipedia\u2019s count) but Sag-Aftra is likely to pack a powerful punch. For one thing, its leading members are much more visible than those of the writers\u2019 union, the WGA, whose strike began in May. And the disappearance of actors means shooting, the most cash-intensive part of the production process, has to stop immediately. But the knock-on effects of the strike aren\u2019t apparent instantly \u2013 this isn\u2019t like refuse or power workers. Both sides are playing a long game: the actors and writers gambling that the product pipeline \u2013 already threadbare after Covid \u2013 will force the studios back to the table, while the bosses are taking the time-honoured route of trying to batter the unions into submission. What will this mean for the UK? Equity, the UK actors\u2019 union, has said it will \u201cstand in unwavering solidarity\u201d with Sag-Atfra, meaning any of its members who hold joint cards will be loth to work if in doubt, and those who don\u2019t will feel uncomfortable if there\u2019s any sense they are taking work from striking colleagues. Beyond that, many productions on these shores are to a greater or lesser extent co-productions. The UK\u2019s biggest studios host major US productions, all of which are now on hold. These include Deadpool 3, which has been filming at Pinewood, Tim Burton\u2019s Beetlejuice sequel, Idris Elba thriller Heads of State and the film version of Wicked. TV shows in production and now under threat are second seasons of Andor and The Sandman, and Eddie Redmayne\u2019s The Day of the Jackal. What are the other immediate effects? As well as halting most shoots, the small print of Sag-Aftra\u2019s terms means actors will no longer be able to promote shows and films they have already made. Hence the moving forward by an hour of the start time of Oppenheimer\u2019s London premiere, so its cast could walk the red carpet before the 8pm deadline. The promotional ban extends to social media, with stars now muzzled about their forthcoming work. It also means chatshows will be strikingly light on actors for the foreseeable and any print or radio interviews scheduled to happen from Friday onwards have been cancelled. What about in the next few months? The most pressing effect is likely to be on the autumn festivals \u2013 Venice, Telluride and Toronto \u2013 which start at the end of next month. All three are heavily reliant on star wattage to launch movies hoping for major Oscar action. Yet without A-listers to promote them \u2013 making splashy canal entrances, dolled up on the red carpet and talking to reporters \u2013 much of the draw of such events will be removed. Venice will need to decide whether it can continue with opening night movie Challengers, for instance, if in-person coverage has to exclusively focus on director Luca Guadagnino rather than stars Zendaya and Josh O\u2019Connor. Other films not officially announced for the autumn festivals will rapidly need to recalibrate their strategies. Michael Mann\u2019s Ferrari film could still screen, but without star Adam Driver. When key roles are combined, the situation is potentially more thorny. Bradley Cooper has written, produced, directed and stars in Leonard Bernstein biopic, Maestro. He could promote the film in his producing and directing capacities but would have to refuse any questions about his script or performance.",

            "title": "SAG strike: Actors join writers on Hollywood picket lines",
            "text": "Jason Sudeikis, Susan Sarandon and thousands of actors have joined screenwriters on Hollywood picket lines in its biggest strike in over 60 years. Writers walked off the job in May, frustrated over pay, working conditions and a lack of protections from advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Major films in production including the Avatar and Gladiator sequels may be affected by the shutdown. While the strike lasts, actors cannot appear in films or even promote movies. Brian Cox, the lead actor on HBO's Succession, told the BBC the strike could last \"until the end of the year\". \"The whole streaming thing has shifted the paradigm,\" the Scottish star told BBC Newscast. \"They are trying to freeze us out and beat us into the ground, because there's a lot of money to be made in streaming and the desire is not to share it with the writers or the performers.\" About 160,000 performers stopped work at midnight on Thursday, and had gathered outside the offices of major studios and streaming services in Los Angeles, New York and other cities by noon on Friday. They have received support from celebrities in the movie and television business, including the stars of the upcoming Oppenheimer movie, who walked off the red carpet on Thursday night. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) wants streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits, better working conditions and guarantees that artificial intelligence will not be used to replace actors. Productions likely to be affected include sequels to the Avatar, Deadpool and Gladiator franchises, as well as upcoming seasons of shows such as House of the Dragon, Family Guy and The Simpsons. Red-carpet premieres, promotional interviews, and events including the Emmys and Comic-Con, have already been halted, rescheduled or scaled back. The strike action is driven in part by an uncomfortable transition to the era of digital streaming, as well as by broader technological changes. \"There's definitely always been the feeling that if it isn't solved now, how do we ever solve it in the future?\" Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon told the BBC from a picket line in New York. \"If you don't have the foresight to put something in place for the future, then you're screwed. It's clear that nothing is going to change from the top down, it's going to be up to us at the bottom.\" Both writers and actors have complained that they make far less money than they used to make and that contracts have been undercut by inflation. For actors, pay for individual roles has declined, forcing them to seek several more roles to make the same amount of money as they did a few years ago. Writing contracts have become shorter and more perilous, with payment often not included for writers' work on revisions or new material. \"We are being victimised by a very greedy entity,\" Fran Drescher, the current SAG president, said Thursday. \"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us.\" The failed negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMTP) marks the first tandem strike in the industry since 1960. A third union, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), is not participating in the strike after successfully negotiating a contract in June. But the group has said it \"strongly supports\" those who are picketing. With the prospect that the strike could roll on for months, cinemas could face problems, and viewers may be left with nothing new to watch bar reality TV and live sport.",

            "text": "Every movement needs a face. As SAG-AFTRA, the guild that represents film and TV actors, joins the Writers Guild of America in its labor strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) there will be some debate over who's right for that job. In the short term Fran Drescher, the actors guild's president, leapt to the fore with her fiery strike announcement on Thursday. \"I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things,\" Drescher said at the guild's press conference. \"How they plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them. They stand on the wrong side of history at this very moment.\" Drescher is not exaggerating. The labor movement is experiencing a resurgence the likes of which hasn't been seen in decades. Los Angeles alone has been impacted by teachers, dock workers and hotel employees organizing work stoppages in recent months. Unionizing efforts continue at major companies, including Starbucks and Amazon. Friday marks the first day that SAG-AFTRA hits the sidewalks, combining their 160,000-strong membership with striking WGA writers on the picket lines. Such a historic \"double strike\" with actors and writers walking out together hasn't occurred since 1960. The last time SAG-AFTRA went on strike was 43 years ago. (Salon's unionized employees are represented by the WGA East. The WGA represents 11,500 television and screenwriters.) This also means that picket lines will turn into more of a spectacle than they already were. On the red carpet for the London premiere of \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge both confirmed that they would be walking out. \"I believe in unions. I believe in labor. I believe in representation, all of those things,\" Ford told a reporter. \"If my union votes to go out, I'll go out.\" That was in June. Much closer to the deadline the cast of the \"Oppenheimer\" walked that film's London step-and-repeat an hour earlier than originally scheduled, fully aware that it would be the last press event they'd be authorized to participate in for the foreseeable future. Strike rules prohibit actors from promoting any shows or films that have been produced or are in production under the guild's expired contract with the AMPTP. That also all but guarantees that the Emmys will be postponed from its originally scheduled Sept.18 airdate. If any A-listers walk the picket line they'll be late to a writer-stocked battlefront that's already been supported by stars such as Bob Odenkirk, Mandy Patinkin and the cast of \"Ted Lasso.\" Actor Bob Odenkirk seen marching in solidarity with the WGA. (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) Such visible support from beloved celebrities is potent. It can also be turned against the people who are striking for better working conditions and more equitable compensation, which the AMPTP \u2013 an alliance representing studios and media conglomerates \u2013 is counting on. Drescher's fiery call to arms resonates with the common worker whose wages haven't kept up with inflation, but scored highly among those who still view her with no shortage of fondness as the star of \"The Nanny.\" But as the combined strike rolls on and photographers capture actors wearing pieces of clothing worth more than the average person makes in a week, their demands for better pay might not land as solidly. So allow me to suggest that Florence Pugh or Matt Damon aren't the best front-facing representatives of the striking guilds' determination. What this walkout needs, however, is a villain the people intimately understand. Give them \"Succession\" mogul Logan Roy. The AMPTP has not trotted out a representative at whom we might might target our proverbial rotten tomatoes, only statements such as this : \"A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life,\" the alliance declared Thursday. \"The Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\" This certainly makes it sound like this small group of very wealthy executives is very concerned about the little guy. Major media corporations' PR teams are experts at saying what they believe the little people want to hear. In this moment, however, that message is about a decade out of date. But \"Succession\" gets it. References to the drama showed up on picket signs early in the WGA strike when writers humorously threatened to spoil its ending. In May, when the writers began picketing, the Roys were all anyone who watched TV could talk about. This week the show was nominated for 27 Emmys including best drama and acting nods for its four leads including Brian Cox, who plays Logan. James Cromwell in \"Succession\" (Macall Polay/HBO) Lest we miss one of the central messages of the show, its creator and WGA member Jesse Armstrong spells out who Logan Roy was in the eulogy delivered by this brother Ewan, played by James Cromwell. Logan, Ewan says, \"fed that dark flame in men, the hard, mean, hard-relenting flame that keeps their heart warm while another grows cold. Their grain stashed while another goes hungry. And even has the temerity to tell that hard but funny joke about the man in the cold. You can get a little high, a little mighty when you're warm.\" Now, imagine a small group of Logans working together against tens of thousands of writers and actors, most of whom simply want to pay their rent and buy groceries (or fresh pizza!) by plying their craft. Or, you know, don't imagine. Turn on your TV for a rewatch. Better yet, simply wait for someone like Disney CEO Bob Iger to open his mouth in front of a microphone. On Thursday's episode of CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" Iger assured viewers that he takes the writers and actors guilds' concerns about equitable compensation seriously. Nevertheless, \"There is a level of expectation they have that is just not realistic,\" he said after bemoaning all the disruptive forces hitting the business, which hasn't entirely recovered from COVID. \"This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption,\" he said, with the postcard-perfect mountains looming in the background. CNBC caught up with Iger at the famous Allen & Company Sun Valley conference, a retreat colloquially known as \"summer camp for billionaires.\" You know, like \"Argestes.\" The day before that interview, Iger signed a contract extension with Disney that bumps up his annual target salary from $27 million to $31 million, provided he remains with the company through 2026 instead of 2024 and meets certain goals. Like, say, \"cost-cutting.\" This places him in the ballpark of Netflix's co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos, whose 2022 compensation plan is valued at around $50 million, according to a recent Los Angeles Times analysis of data provided by Equilar, Inc. factoring in stock options, base salaries and bonuses. His co-CEO, company chairman Reed Hastings, pulled around $51 million that same year. Warner Bros. Discover chief David Zaslav only made around $39 million in 2022, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing. But in 2021 he famously pocketed a $246.6 million compensation package that included stock options worth $201 million. Between 2018 and 2022, Zaslav \u2013 one guy \u2013 made $498,915,318, according to that L.A. Times report. Two months ago at a party Zaslav hosted at Cannes, a guest was overheard saying, according to the Wall Street Journal, \"This is what a recession looks like,\" while gesturing at two megayachts in the distance. \"There used to be 20 of these.\" Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch pulled lower salaries than any of these men in 2022 \u2013 technically \u2013 which is important to note since Logan Roy is largely based on Rupert. Meanwhile the WGA says the median screenwriter pay has dropped 14% when adjusted for inflation over the last five years, while the L.A. Times report indicates that the average pay for top studio executives rose 53% from 2018, roughly 108 times the average writer's pay. Among other key issues, both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA are striking for better wages and residuals, along with a more equitable compensation structure related to streaming content. Placing safeguards around the user of artificial intelligence to generate scripts or digitize and use performers' likenesses without payment or approval is also an existential issue. These gains would help mainly writers and actors who once made a living that qualified them as middle class, so if you're worried about how Tom Cruise will manage these difficult days, don't.

Instead, keep a close eye on how this strike progresses after this week's injection of star power. With the actors in the fight, the likelihood of this strike's outcome influencing future labor negotiations has increased substantially. History proves this by way of former SAG-AFTRA president Ronald Reagan, who led his guild on strike shoulder to shoulder with writers in 1960. However, the Reagan I'm referencing is his August 1981 version, when he was serving his first term as President of the United States. One of Reagan's earliest presidential acts was to publicly and swiftly crush a strike called by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers union. Those workers sought across-the-board raises of at least 10%. The government offered 5%, which the union did not accept. Reagan declared the strike to be unlawful, announcing that air traffic controllers who walked off their jobs had 48 hours to return to their jobs or lose them. And he was true to his word. The people who returned to work kept the planes in the air and ensured travel continued without interruptions. Those who remained on the picket line were fired. As Reagan's head of employees Donald Devine told NPR's Planet Money in 2019, other industries' executives took note. \"Businessmen would come up to me and say, you know, when your guy, Reagan, stood firm with those guys, I started getting tougher with my unions, too; I realized I was giving away the store,\" Devine said. With this single blow Reagan transformed striking workers from heroes to troublemakers messing up the system for good, reliable employees. Unions have been gaining momentum in recent years, but this strike's visibility could be a decisive swing in the opposite direction of what Reagan set in motion 42 years ago. \"Eventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles, and then it's over,\" Drescher warned on Thursday. \"We're at that moment right now.\" Her battle cry was pitch perfect, and it looks like everyday people tuned in. But if movies and TV have taught us anything, if you want to hold people's attention you must show them a villain worth defeating. Cox and \"Succession\" served up a brilliant one, available any time we nine-to-fivers (if only!) forget why these labor walkouts need to happen.",

            "text": "Thousands of creatives took to the streets of Los Angeles on Friday, picketing outside major studios after the start of the strike, which threatens to derail productions at both home and abroad. Actors stood shoulder to shoulder with writers outside major production companies, including Warner Bros, Netflix and Disney in the sweltering heat, while cars drove by honking their horns in support. Multiple celebrities including George Clooney, Halle Berry and Alec Baldwin have expressed support for the action, announced by the Screen Actors Guild \u2013 American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) on Thursday. In a statement shared with the PA news agency, Clooney said: \u201cThis is an inflection point in our industry.

Phil Clapp told the PA news agency that disruption may be minimal, though it was likely that some film premieres in the UK would go ahead without talent until the dispute was resolved. \u201cWhile it will clearly be for each individual to make their own decision, it may be that until the dispute is resolved we will see some premieres not being supported by the \u2018talent\u2019 in front of or behind the camera,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cIn terms of wider UK cinema-going, then given the challenges UK cinema operators have faced in the last few years, all will be concerned by anything which might potentially threaten the supply of films to the big screen, and so it is very much hoped that there will be a quick resolution. \u201cUnless the current strike is a protracted one, we are confident that cinemas will see little if any disruption in the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. Among the productions in the UK that could be affected by the strike action is the filming of Deadpool 3, starring Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. House Of The Dragon series two with Matt Smith and Emma D\u2019Arcy could also be affected, alongside the second series of The Sandman with Tom Sturridge and the fourth series of Slow Horses with Academy Award winner Gary Oldman. Other events that may be affected by the strike could include red carpet premieres and film festivals, including those in Venice and Toronto, and awards shows such as the 75th Emmy Awards. In Los Angeles on Friday, Sag-Aftra members said the support from other creative unions had been \u201coverwhelming\u201d. The union joins over 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), who have been on strike since May 2. Bertila Damas, actress and former member of the Sag-Aftra board, said the turnout was \u201cextraordinary, but not surprising\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dismissed, we\u2019ve been treated less than, we\u2019ve been otherised as if the business didn\u2019t depend on our backs and the writers,\u201d she told PA. \u201cThis is an extraordinary show of solidarity and it\u2019s about time.\u201d Damas said she did not feel nervous \u201cat all\u201d with being on strike and stopping work, but voiced concerns about younger members of the union. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time and I\u2019m not as concerned, I can weather the storm of unemployment,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger deal than it\u2019s ever been.

What we\u2019re asking for, if you ask me, is still not enough.\u201d Stunt coordinator Mikal Kartvedt said the added weight of the actors\u2019 union membership to the ongoing writers\u2019 strike was a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. \u201cThis could be a real crusher when it comes to the timeframe the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers) thought they were working with, especially with the writers \u2013 this is a gamechanger for the whole thing,\u201d he told PA. \u201cShows that were already in the pipeline and ready to go to production, you could rationalise that you don\u2019t need writers and you could shoot the show anyway. \u201cWithout Sag-Aftra, there\u2019s nothing going on anyway.\u201d",

            "text": "Colum Harmon, marketing director, PML Group with this week\u2019s Out \\ Look on Out of Home. Summer\u2019s here and the outlook for Outdoor is bright following a busy H1. School\u2019s out for summer and cycle 14 in the world of Outdoor media certainly reflects the more relaxed and fun vibe of this time of year. The soft drink sector has been busy in 2023, with a 29% uplift in display values for the first half of the year. The trend has continued into H2 with campaigns for 7UP Free, Pepsi Max, Coca Cola and Lucozade all on display this week. Following a difficult few years, the film sector is growing again on OOH, with an 11% increase in display value for H1 2023. The mix of blockbusters and family-orientated releases makes summer a peak period for the sector and in cycle 14 campaigns for Disney\u2019s Elemental, Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, Oppenheimer and Barbie are all active across a mix of roadside, digital and transport formats, once again underlining OOH\u2019s ability to drive interest and footfall in the cinema. Summer is, of course, prime time for the country\u2019s biggest and best visitor attractions and what better way to engage both the domestic and tourist market than via the medium they encounter while out and about, exploring our towns and cities. EPIC, the Irish emigration museum, and Guinness Storehouse are two such attractions and both are incorporating highly visible, impactful Dublin city mobile transport formats into their summer marketing plan. We\u2019re all still getting used to the more condensed GAA championship season and in mid-July we are right at the business end of this year\u2019s schedule. Perfect time for AIB to reinforce its GAA association with a powerful and poignant message across large format billboards, bus shelters and digital retail and commuter panels. The campaign is an example of that strong connection between the OOH medium, event-based messaging and location marketing, that resonates with local and national audiences. Summer wouldn\u2019t be summer without a cool treat and a McFlurry is an ever-popular choice. This summer, or at least until August 1st, ice cream afficionados can indulge in the new Lotus Biscoff flavour from McDonald\u2019s. OOH is a visual medium and attractive creative certainly adds appetite appeal. Definitely one to be sampled before it\u2019s too late! The QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) category in general has grown by 32% compared to H1 2022 and accounts for 6.4% of the OOH market this year. Retail continues to lead the way in terms of categories, with a 12% SOV, followed by Beers (8.6%) and Food, at 8.4%. Seven of the top ten categories have increased their OOH investment in 2023, at an average of +38%. PML Group\u2019s WATCH figures for the OOH market, based on 100% monitoring of the medium each cycle, shows that Diageo remain top advertiser in H1 2023, followed by McDonald\u2019s and Mondel\u00e9z. Advertisers that have increased investment heavily in OOH this year also include Heineken Ireland, ESB and Premier Lotteries Ireland. A full WATCH report on H1 2023 will be published by PML Group next week.

With consumers spoilt for choice when it comes to respective markets, how do they respond when brands they trust cross boundaries and venture into new spaces? Is it the reliability, the curiosity of innovation, or simply the comfort of a known name in unknown territory that holds their interest? To answer these questions, we delved into these consumer attitudes as part of our Media Impact Study, surveying 300 participants aged between 16 and 54. Consumers were drawn to the reputation of a brand, with 85% marking it as a compelling reason to try new offerings. The research results showcased interesting demographic dynamics: the 16-24 age group stood out as the most receptive to brands\u2019 foray into new territories, with a remarkable 91% affirming they would experiment with fresh offerings if they\u2019ve proven reliable in the past. Older consumers aged 45-54 weren\u2019t far behind, with 85% also indicating a similar willingness. What propels this acceptance of brand boundary-crossing? Our findings revealed that brand trust was paramount. 72% of respondents noted they would use/buy a new product or service from a trusted brand, regardless of what the brand was initially known for. This was most pronounced among female respondents at 78%, rising to 84% in the 25-34 age bracket. Adults 45-54 again responded strongly at 75%. Demonstrating a strong inclination towards innovation, 75% of males noted they are interested when they see brands branch into new product and service areas. This rises to 79% of all respondents, peaking once again in the 16-24 bracket at 87%. These survey results depict a dynamic consumer landscape in Ireland. The younger demographic demonstrates readiness to embrace change, influenced by a mix of brand trust, reputation, and the appeal of innovation. Yet, the importance placed on familiarity and convenience among certain demographics signifies a crucial balancing act for brands: to innovate while maintaining their core identity when entering new sectors. For new product launches, Outdoor has proven to be a strong medium in consumer discovery of new brands. OOH interacts with consumers as they live, work and play. At multiple touchpoints throughout the day, consumers are exposed to various OOH platforms \u2013 commuting, shopping, socialising and working. Our previous iQ results noted that 65% of all adults noted Out of Home as helping them discover a new brand, rising to 79% of AB males and 70% of parents.

Festival Fever While the Irish Summer continues assert its indecisive position on what the weather forecast should be, the events landscape has firmly rooted the public in the Summer mindset. Festivals and concerts have taken the country by storm, with each week offering a plethora of choice when it comes to Summer activity. This weekend is no exception, as Forever Young takes place at Palmerstown House Estate in Johnstown, Kildare. Now in its third year, the retro festival sports a lineup that could masquerade as Electric Picnic in the 1980s. From the spry post-punk of Squeeze to Bananarama\u2019s pioneering girl pop and Erasure\u2019s synths, the festival is a throwback for those not fussed with the signature autotune and trap beats populating much of current festival headliners. The festival had been running on Outdoor in the leadup to this weekend. Planned by Source out of home, the signature \u2018badge\u2019 lineup could be seen on display across a mixture of digital 6\u2019s and transit formats throughout cycles 10 and 11. When it comes to event-based marketing, Out of Home can adapt to meet a brand\u2019s needs. Recent iQ research conducted with Ipsos revealed that 56% of Dubliners will attend a concert or festival planned for this year. This increases among younger audience groups with 65% of 16-24 year olds and 72% of full-time students noting their concert-going intentions for the summer. There is a vibrancy in what is going on in the great outdoors over the next few months. From sporting and retail to cultural events, OOH is the perfect medium to reach these large audiences on the move at the right place and at the right time as they live, work and play.

            "title": "Can\u2019t Wait For The Barbie Movie? Here\u2019s Everything You Need To Know",
            "text": "A Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and directed by Greta Gerwig was always going to pique our interest. But ever since the first teaser was released earlier this year, it became clear that the forthcoming film had the potential to surpass even our wildest expectations. Greta and Margot (who is also the film\u2019s executive producer) haven\u2019t just managed to assemble a seriously star-studded cast. The attention to detail in everything from the sets to the costumes to deep cuts of Barbie mythology is also pretty incredible. And from the trailer at least, it seems like the script, co-written by Greta with her husband Noah Baumbach, will manage to pull off an impressive feat: poking fun at Barbie\u2019s plastic fantastic world while also reminding us of why we fell in love with the doll in the first place. Can\u2019t wait to catch the film in cinemas (potentially as part of a tonally jarring double bill with Oppenheimer, which is released on the same day?) From the stars to the soundtrack to the plot, here\u2019s what you need to know beforehand... Who\u2019s in the cast of the Barbie movie? Greta has managed to assemble a truly staggering array of talent for the movie, ranging from Hollywood A-listers to rising stars to British comedy favourites. Margot, of course, leads the cast as stereotypical Barbie, joined by Ryan as Ken, whose job is \u201cjust beach\u201d. First up, the Barbies. Emma Mackey, Hari Nef, Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp and Sharon Rooney play physicist Barbie, doctor Barbie, president Barbie, writer Barbie and lawyer Barbie respectively, joined by Kate McKinnon as weird Barbie (who, with her choppy hair and scribbled-on face, looks like she\u2019s been customised by her previous owners), Ritu Arya as journalist Barbie, Dua Lipa as mermaid Barbie, Nicola Coughlan as diplomat Barbie and Ana Cruz Kayne as judge Barbie. Phew. Oh, and there\u2019s Midge, Barbie\u2019s best friend, played by Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennell (who you might also recognise from her stint as The Crown\u2019s Camilla Parker Bowles). Then, there\u2019s the Kens. Joining Ryan are Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans and Kingsley Ben-Adir as other variations on Barbie\u2019s boyfriend, while John Cena also crops up as merman Ken and Michael Cera plays Allan, Ken\u2019s pal. In the real world, America Ferrera is Mattel employee Gloria, whose daughter Sasha is played by Ariana Greenblatt. Will Ferrell takes the role of the toy company\u2019s CEO, and his sidekicks are played by Stath Lets Flats\u2019 Jamie Demetriou and Sex Education\u2019s Connor Swindells. Rhea Perlman also has a yet-to-be-confirmed role in the movie, with fans speculating online that she might be playing Ruth Handler, who invented the Barbie doll. What is the Barbie movie all about? Exact details of the movie\u2019s plot are still closely guarded secrets, but it seems that the story plays out something like this. Barbie lives a pretty much perfect life with her fellow plastic pals in Barbie Land - until she starts to suffer from an existential crisis. \u201cDo you guys ever think about dying?\u201d Margot\u2019s character asks the other Barbies and Kens mid-dance sequence in one much-memed scene from the film\u2019s trailer. Plus, instead of remaining arched, her feet go flat. The horror! After starting to question her very existence, Barbie heads off on a journey to the real world (and, from the trailer, it looks like Ken tags along with her). Once she has arrived, she meets some actual humans \u2013 including Gloria, the Mattel employee played by America Ferrera (yes, in this movie, Barbie visits Mattel HQ. How meta). According to director Greta Gerwig, the film is about how young girls don\u2019t just stop playing with dolls as they grow up \u2013 they also often lose a lot of their self-belief, too. \u201cThey\u2019re funny and brash and confident, and then they just - stop,\u201d she told Vogue. She wanted Barbie\u2019s journey to reflect \u201cthe same thing that a teenage girl feels\u2026 All of a sudden, she thinks, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not good enough\u2019\u201d. Is there a trailer? We\u2019ve lost count of just how many times we\u2019ve watched the Barbie trailer since it dropped online earlier this year. The teaser kicks off with an unforgettable shot showing Barbie stepping out of her high heels, only for her feet to retain that perfectly arched shape, and it only gets better from there. First we see snippets from stereotypical Barbie\u2019s apparently perfect life with her friends in Barbie Land, featuring parties with specially choreographed dance routines and days out at the beach \u2013 until her existential crisis starts to kick in. She heads out of town to see weird Barbie, who tells her to travel to the real world, which is where her adventures really begin. Which artists feature on the soundtrack? As well as lining up an impressive cast, the movie\u2019s soundtrack also boasts plenty of brilliant musicians. Dua Lipa\u2019s Dance The Night was the first song to be teased, then the trailer revealed that Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice had teamed up to record Barbie World, which samples Aqua\u2019s track Barbie Girl. Margot was especially keen for the movie to pay tribute to the iconic 1997 banger. \u201cI was like, \u2018Greta, how are we going to incorporate this song?\u2019\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201c\u2018We can\u2019t do a Barbie movie and not have a nod to Aqua\u2019s Barbie Girl. It has to be in there.\u2019 And [Greta] was like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to find a cool way to incorporate it\u2019\u201d. Plus, there\u2019s also songs from (deep breath) Lizzo, Charli XCX, Karol G, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, Dominic Fike, Haim, Billie Eilish, The Kid Laroi, Khalid, PinkPantheress, Gayle, Ava Max, and FiftyFifty. And it gets better - Ryan has also recorded his own Ken-ergy-fuelled power ballad, titled I\u2019m Just Ken, which was written by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt (who previously co-wrote Shallow, the Oscar-winning Lady Gaga track from A Star Is Born. What have the first reactions been like? After the film\u2019s LA premiere earlier this week, the first responses from critics started to drop. Full reviews won\u2019t be unveiled until closer to Barbie\u2019s 21 July release date, but so far, the reactions seem pretty effusive. Critic Jamie Jirak from ComicBook.com hailed Barbie as \u201cmy favourite film of the year\u201d, adding: \u201cGreta Gerwig somehow exceeded my expectations. She tackles the positives and negatives of Barbie so beautifully. Give Ryan Gosling an Oscar nomination, I\u2019m dead serious!\u201d ScreenRant\u2019s Joseph Deckelmeier echoed her sentiments, describing the film as \u201cfunny, bombastic, & very smart\u201d. He also described Margot as \u201cgreat\u201d and Ryan and Simu as \u201cpure entertainment\u201d. Critic Carla Renata branded the movie \u201coverblown fun with a feminist twist\u201d, and also praised \u201cthe production design, costumes, hair and makeup\u201d. Writer and producer Ben Mekler claimed that \u201cGosling steals the show\u201d, describing the film as \u201ca knockout\u201d and \u201ca total crowd pleaser\u201d. These early reactions have only caused our anticipation (already at feverish levels) to increase. Can 21 July hurry up, please?",

            "title": "Atomic bomb anniversary: Decades after first test in 1945, nuclear disarmament has stalled",
            "text": "The first atomic bomb test took place 78 years ago this Sunday \u2014 July 16, 1945 \u2014 and opened the door to the dangerous nuclear arms race the world has seen ever since. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a leader in the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb during World War II, thought after the blast: \u2018\u2019Now, I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\u201d But we must also remember a moment of hope 18 years after that first nuclear weapons test by the United States, code-named Trinity. In July 1963, President John F. Kennedy addressed the nation: \u201cI speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope. Eighteen years ago the advent of nuclear weapons changed the course of the world as well as the war. Since that time, all mankind has been struggling to escape from the darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth.\u201d JFK announced the signing of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union: \u201cYesterday, a shaft of light cut into the darkness. Negotiations were concluded in Moscow on a treaty to ban all nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water.\u201d Keep in mind this treaty came almost one year after the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the U.S. and Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war in October 1962. Nuclear weapons testing was prolific on both sides even during the crisis. The world needed some hope. The 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty provided some restraint on the nuclear arms race. It was the beginning of hope, and each subsequent nuclear arms control treaty since then has tried to build momentum toward disarmament and peace. But today, as we know, so much more needs to be done, as there are over 12,500 nuclear warheads in the world, according to the Arms Control Association. About 90% of these weapons are held by the U.S. and Russia. Progress toward nuclear disarmament has stalled. Nuclear states are modernizing their arsenals. The war in Ukraine has even raised the horrifying possibility of nuclear weapons being used by Russia. A report from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons confirms again that too much money is wasted on nukes. Their new report says nine nuclear-armed states spent $82.9 billion on such weapons in 2022. We as nations have to do better. Nuclear spending is out of control, wasting precious resources and adding to existing global tensions. Meanwhile, programs such as food aid to provide relief to those starving, are low on funds. The United States and other nuclear states need to divert spending away from nuclear arsenals and toward global food aid, by reducing their reliance and emphasis on nukes and stepping up or resuming negotiations for treaties to reduce nuclear arsenals. The United States, Russia and China should lead in nuclear disarmament. Instead of thousands of nukes worldwide, why not bring that number down to hundreds quickly? Reducing nukes can offer a vision for how to get to zero weapons, creating more security for every nation.

            "title": "George Clooney, More SAG Actors Speak Out on Hollywood Strike",
            "text": "On Friday morning, hours into the first commercial actors strike in 23 years, George Clooney has become the latest A-lister to voice his support for the walkout. In a statement provided to Deadline, Clooney said that \u201cactors and writers in large numbers have lost their ability to make a living.\u201d As actors and writers strike together for the first time since 1960, Clooney added, \u201cThis is an inflection point in our industry. For our industry to survive that has to change. For actors, that journey starts now.\u201d Wednesday marked a historic turning point for Hollywood\u2019s labor battle. Throughout the week, anticipation loomed as more than 100,000 actors waited for confirmation that they\u2019d be going on strike. \u201cI see a strike in my crystal ball,\u201d Jamie Lee Curtis wrote Wednesday on Instagram, in her final social media post promoting Disney\u2019s upcoming Haunted Mansion. \u201cThe souls of ghosts of performers long past urging us in this modern moment to fight for our rights to exist as creators.\u201d Now that the strike has been confirmed, more and more actors are speaking out. \u201cThe writing is on the wall,\u201d Law & Order: Criminal Intent actor Vincent D\u2019Onofrio wrote on Twitter earlier this week as negotiations were still happening. \u201c\u2026Eyes are on us let\u2019s finally be the Union we should have always been.\u201d Without actors and writers, he added, \u201cthere are no productions.\u201d To make things even more chaotic, the Emmys announced this year\u2019s nominations Wednesday morning\u2014while SAG-AFTRA was approaching its midnight contract-negotiation deadline with Hollywood\u2019s major film studios. Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter after receiving her second nomination for best actress in a comedy, Abbott Elementary star Sheryl Lee Ralph said that actors are \u201cfighting for our art.\u201d Ralph emphasized to THR that most working actors aren\u2019t millionaire A-listers, or even series regulars who make \u201cgood money.\u201d (For perspective, SAG-AFTRA represents about 160,000 members.) \u201cWe\u2019re talking about plain, old, ordinary, working class people who in 40 years have not gotten a cost of living raise,\u201d the actress said. \u201c\u2026 And somehow they\u2019re making people who are just fighting to live look like the bad guys.\u201d Several celebrities shared their support for the strike with Vanity Fair in a piece published Thursday. \u201cTechnology has changed so much about the industry in the last 10 years, it feels like it\u2019s absolutely time,\u201d Daniel Radcliffe told VF. Aunjanue Ellis added, \u201cIt really is the haves versus the have-nots, and just the incredible imbalance between folks who have most of the money and folks who don\u2019t have the money at all.\u201d On Thursday afternoon, after SAG-AFTRA\u2019s National Board held a final vote, the union\u2019s president, Fran Drescher, confirmed the strike in a fiery speech. \u201cWe are being victimized by a very greedy entity,\u201d Drescher said. \u201c\u2026 I cannot believe how far apart we are on so many things, how they plead poverty while giving millions of dollars to their CEOs. Shame on them! They are on the wrong side of history.\u201d Drescher\u2019s words seemed to resonate with members including Kim Cattrall, Bob Odenkirk, Jessica Chastain, Ben Stiller, Josh Gad, and John Cusack, who have shared clips, quotes, and words of approval. \u201cSending love to all my fellow actors and writers,\u201d Keke Palmer tweeted that afternoon. \u201cPraying that this is resolved swiftly and we all come out feeling empowered! Families have to be fed but people have to and deserved be respected for their work as well.\u201d \u201cThe @sagaftra strike has at last arrived,\u201d And Just Like That actress and director Cynthia Nixon tweeted Thursday. \u201cI am proud to be standing tall with the @WGAWest and @WGAEast as actors and writers together demand a fair share of the record-breaking profits the studios have been reaping from our labor for far too long. We will win this!\u201d Actors also walked out of premiere events for both Barbie and Oppenheimer on Thursday, where, earlier, stars including Margot Robbie, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon been discussing the impending walkout with reporters. And by Friday morning, photos had already begun to emerge of Drescher and her fellow actors joining the WGA on the picket line.

            "text": "Matt Damon opened up about how his wife Luciana Barroso helped him when he \"fell into a depression\" on the set of a movie. During an interview on \"Jake's Takes,\" the 52-year-old actor was asked about the best professional advice that he had ever received from a significant other. \"I think, without naming any particular movies, that sometimes you find yourself in a movie that you know perhaps might not be what you had hoped it would be, and you're still making it,\" the \"Oppenheimer\" star said. He continued, \"Halfway through production and you\u2019ve still got months to go, and you\u2019ve taken your family somewhere, and you\u2019ve inconvenienced them.\" MATT DAMON MAKES RARE APPEARANCE WITH DAUGHTERS AS BEN AFFLECK, JENNIFER LOPEZ HEAT UP \u2018AIR\u2019 PREMIERE \"And I remember my wife pulling me up because I fell into a depression about, like, what have I done?\" \"And she just said, \u2018We\u2019re here now,\u2019\" Damon recalled. \"I do pride myself, in a large part because of her, at being a professional actor. And what being a professional actor means is you go and you do the 15-hour day and give it absolutely everything, even in what you know is going to be a losing effort.\" Damon and Barroso met while he was in Miami Beach filming his 2003 comedy \"Stuck on You.\" After a day of shooting, a few of the film's crew members persuaded a reluctant Damon to go out to the bars with them. The group ended up at the nightclub Crobar, where Barroso was working as a bartender. \"I literally saw her across a crowded room, literally,\" Damon recalled during a 2011 appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\" \"Eight years and four kids later, that's my life. I don't know how else our paths would've crossed if that didn't happen.\" The couple tied the knot in 2005 and are parents to daughters Isabella, 16, Gia, 14, and Stella, 12. The Oscar winner is also stepfather to Barroso's daughter Alexia, 24, from a previous relationship.

During a 2021 appearance on the \"WTF\" podcast, Damon reflected on shooting his 2016 monster movie \"The Great Wall.\" The film was a box-office bomb that grossed less than $50 million at the U.S. box office and sits at a dismal 35% on Rotten Tomatoes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I was like, this is exactly how disasters happen,\" Damon told host Marc Maron. \"It doesn\u2019t cohere. It doesn\u2019t work as a movie.\" \"I came to consider that the definition of a professional actor; knowing you\u2019re in a turkey and going, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got four more months,\" he remembered. \"It\u2019s the up at dawn siege on Hamburger Hill. I am definitely going to die here, but I\u2019m doing it.\u2019 That\u2019s as s----y as you can feel creatively, I think. I hope to never have that feeling again,\"",

            "title": "SAG actors\u2019 strike \u2013 latest: Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion premiere goes ahead without single star on red carpet",
            "text": "The premiere for Disney\u2019s star-studded fantasy comedy Haunted Mansion on Saturday night (15 July) became the first major Hollywood event to go ahead without its actors due to the industry strikes. Stars including Tiffany Haddish, LaKeith Stanfield, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Dan Levy and Jamie Lee Curtis were initially due to walk the red carpet, but the studio ended up leaning on performers dressed as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Maleficent, Snow White\u2018s Evil Queen and Cruella, instead. Negotiators for the SAG-AFTRA union unanimously recommended a strike after talks with studios broke down. Scripted TV and movie production ceased immediately in the first dual work stoppage by both actors and writers in 63 years. The Writers Guild of America has been on strike since early May. Both groups demand increases in base pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus assurances that their work will not be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). Both unions are in dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Fran Drescher, former star of The Nanny and the president of SAG-AFTRA, said studios\u2019 responses to the actors\u2019 concerns had been \u201cinsulting and disrespectful\u201d. George Clooney has led A-listers voicing support for the strike, and Jason Sudeikis and Susan Sarandon are among the stars who have been seen on the picket line. Succession actor Brian Cox, meanwhile, has warned that the actors\u2019 strike could get \u201cvery unpleasant\u201d. The cast of Oppenheimer left a London premiere prematurely on Thursday night (13 July) to \u201cgo and write their picket signs\u201d. Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Igercondemned the threatened strike action as \u201cvery disruptive\u201d at the \u201cworst time\u201d as well as calling the expectations of writers and actors \u201cjust not realistic\u201d.",

            "text": "16 July 2023 Robert Downey Jr. found having to publicly redeem himself after going through addiction to be \u201cunnecessarily humiliating\u201d. Robert Downey Jr battled drug addiction The 58-year-old actor was arrested several times on charges related to drugs and spend six months in prison for missing a court-ordered drug test in the late 1990s, but he has been clean since 2003 and while he has \u201cgreat pride\u201d in the fact he was able to speak openly about overcoming his struggles, he admitted it felt unfair that he was put in a position where he felt obliged to try and turn public opinion of him around. He told the New York Times magazine: \u201cI remember with great pride that I was able to even address something like that in a public forum. Yet it would irk me deeply. It felt strangely punitive and unnecessarily humiliating. \u201cThe challenge, though, is, yeah, so what? F*** what you\u2019re going through. Can you show up for this? \u201cThere\u2019s a great story about this guy \u2014 this would never play nowadays \u2014 he was in one of his last Zen trainings, and he was told to go to the lingerie section at Lord + Taylor and just stand there until women felt uncomfortable. It\u2019s this idea of purposefully putting yourself in a situation where you will feel judged. \u201cThe only difference between that misguided aspiring Zen master and me is I didn\u2019t sign up to have that kind of experience. But once you\u2019re there, you gotta roll with the punches.\u201d The \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 actor admitted he finds cancel culture \u201cbaffling\u201d. He said: \u201cI am close with people right now who have gotten caught up in this iteration of the pendulum-like nature of culture deciding who is and isn\u2019t OK. It is baffling.\u201d The \u2018Iron Man\u2019 actor advised those who find themselves out of favour with the public to \u201cbe still\u201d and wait for things to die down. He said: \u201cI feel a bit fugazi when I\u2019m trying to apply the metrics of the \u201980s, \u201990s and the early aughts to what\u2019s occurred in the last five or seven years, but I think there\u2019s usually a two-year turnaround on sinking to the depths of the Mariana Trench until you get back up to the surface. \u201cYou come up too quick, we know what happens. \u201cThere are many points in a comeback or being seen in a favourable light by your peers that, I\u2019ll speak for myself, I wanted to happen sooner than it did, and I felt victimised by the timeline. \u201cBut mankind\u2019s greatest challenge is to be still. Stay on the bus. The scenery\u2019s changing. You don\u2019t get to decide where you get off the bus. The driver will let you know when you\u2019ve arrived at your stop. But that\u2019s that intolerable thing of how will I know when this nightmare is over? How do you know? Because you wake up.\u201d",

            "text": "16 July 2023 Emily Blunt is \u201cjust taking a little downtime\u201d. Emily Blunt won\u2019t be off screen for too long The \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 actress \u2013 who has daughters Hazel, nine, and Violet, seven, with husband and fellow actor John Krasinski \u2013 recently caused a stir when she said she was taking a break from her career to be with her family, but she\u2019s now clarified she\u2019s simply taking a temporary break and will return to acting in a few months time. She told Deadline: \u201cHonestly, that story got so overblown. I\u2019m just taking a little downtime, not quitting Hollywood. I was just taking some months off to be with the kids.\u201d The \u2018Jungle Cruise\u2019 star had explained she wanted to spend more time at home to be with her kids for the tiny moments that are \u201cso important\u201d while they are still young. Appearing on iHeartPodcast\u2019s \u2018Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi\u2019, she said: \u201cThis year, I\u2019m not working. \u201cI worked quite a bit last year, and my oldest baby is nine, so we\u2019re in the last year of single digits. \u201cI just feel there are cornerstones to their day that are so important when they\u2019re little. \u201cAnd it\u2019s, \u2018Will you wake me up? Will you take me to school? Will you pick me up? Will you put me to bed?\u2019 \u201cAnd I just need to be there for all of them for a good stretch. And I just felt that in my bones.\u201d Meanwhile, Emily recently admitted her \u201ctoes curl\u201d whenever she hears about a child wanting to be a star because the industry is to \u201chard\u201d to get into in the first place. She told Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK: \u201cMy toes curl when people tell me, \u2018My daughter wants to be an actress\u2019. \u201cI want to say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it!\u2019 Because it\u2019s a hard industry and it can be very disappointing. \u201cA lot of people tell you not to take things personally \u2013 but it\u2019s completely personal, especially when you\u2019re being judged on how you look. So you just have to endure that side of things.\u201d",

            "title": "The History Of The Blockbuster Movie - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "Directed by Steven Spielberg, then just 26 years old, \u201cJaws\u201d surfaced in the summer of 1975. John Williams\u2019 theme (the most famous two notes in Hollywood history), and those teeth, scared families out of the water and into movie theaters, becoming the blueprint for the modern blockbuster. \u201cI was a kid when \u2018Jaws\u2019 came out,\u201d said Slate film critic Dana Stevens. \u201cBut I remember that in prime time every night there would be, you know, these scary trailers for \u2018Jaws\u2019 on TV. And so, by the time it opened in the summer of \u201975, people were hyped.\u201d Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz said, \u201cIt was a blockbuster about summer, set in summer, about things that we totally associate with summer.\u201d Thirty-five years after \u201cJaws,\u201d \u201cAvatar\u201d redefined the blockbuster. So far, James Cameron\u2019s 3-D science fiction film has earned $3 billion at the box office. It\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s biggest moneymaker ever. A prolific character actor, Stephen Lang played villain Miles Quaritch in \u201cAvatar.\u201d \u201cIt widened the array of choices that I had,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, one time they asked Robert Mitchum and they said, \u2018How do you choose your roles?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, I read what\u2019s offered and accept the least embarrassing.'\u201d The formula established by \u201cJaws,\u201d then exceeded by \u201cAvatar,\u201d is in theaters this summer: the seventh \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013 they all fit the definition of a big-budget, mass-marketed movie designed to make big money, at the box office and beyond. \u201cThe truth is, the blockbuster is a concept, an idea, a strategy that Hollywood has been using for quite a few decades before 1975, when \u2018Jaws\u2019 was released,\u201d said Charles Acland, who chronicles this cinematic business model in his book, \u201cAmerican Blockbuster.\u201d The term\u2019s origin story is no Hollywood tale; it came from the American military, the name of a devastating World War II bomb. Acland said, \u201cThe blockbuster was initially the highest-capacity explosive that had ever been used in warfare. There was very, very high public awareness of what this was.\u201d Movie studios re-purposed the word in the late 1940s and \u201950s, first as a way to sell films to theaters, and later, to lure audiences back from TV by promoting grand epics, often on a Biblical scale. In 1959, The New York Times used the word \u201cblockbuster\u201d in its review of \u201cBen-Hur.\u201d Of course, not all these epics succeed. There\u2019s 1963\u2019s \u201cCleopatra\u201d (directed by Ben\u2019s great-uncle, Joseph L. Mankiewicz). Twelve years later, \u201cJaws\u201d re-wrote the rules. For every big-budget blockbuster, there are nearly as big-budget bombs: \u201cBattlefield Earth,\u201d \u201cJohn Carter,\u201d \u201cThe Lone Ranger,\u201d \u201cThe Adventures of Pluto Nash,\u201d and, famously, \u201cIshtar.\u201d Stevens said, \u201cI have great affection for \u2018Ishtar\u2019 now, in part because of how poorly received it was at the time, and how quickly it became just a joke.\u201d Meanwhile, far less expensive sleepers hit the jackpot. \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d released in the summer of 1987, cost roughly $6 million to produce, and returned more than $200 million. Stevens said, \u201cThis falls really into that niche about the women\u2019s movie, a movie that focuses on a female character and her world, that isn\u2019t sci-fi/adventure, doesn\u2019t have any violence in it, and has massive, massive appeal.\u201d Premiering next week, \u201cBarbie,\u201d directed by Greta Gerwig, similarly focuses on a female character. Charles Acland believes the movie will sell much more than tickets: \u201cWhat we are talking about here are these really gigantic investment opportunities \u2013 in the case of Mattel, reintroducing Barbie as a particular item of relevance to many different audiences.\u201d For Stephen Lang, the key to turning big-budget film into a blockbuster comes down to a single word: story. \u201cI think as a rule, it\u2019s good to have a very simple narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cTake \u2018E.T.\u2019 I would characterize \u2018E.T.\u2019 as a blockbuster, although, you know, it doesn\u2019t have the huge, huge scale. But what it does have, it\u2019s got the cutest alien ever created, and the storyline\u2019s pretty simple: I\u2019m here, I\u2019m stuck, and I wanna go home.\u201d The fact is, what matters to movie lovers isn\u2019t the take at the box office, but what we take away from the film. Lang said, \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to leach the art out of Hollywood. Think of the films that have come out of there, you know? They\u2019ve been extraordinary. And they can\u2019t be just replaced by comic book characters and just huge stunt films from end to end.\u201d Dana Stevens said, \u201cAnybody who goes to the movies wants to either laugh or cry, to experience intense emotions.\u201d \u201cPeople want to see something move, and they want to be moved,\u201d said Mankiewicz. \u201cRight, moved in both senses \u2013 moving on screen, and moving something inside you.\u201d For more info: Story produced by Gabriel Falcon.

            "title": "Nolte: \u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 Soars to $83 Million as \u2018Dead Reckoning\u2019 Slips",
            "text": "Sound of Freedom is no flash in the pan. In its second weekend, the Angel Studios\u2019 phenomenon grossed another $24.7 million, which is an astonishing 26 percent increase over its debut weekend. Currently, THE MOVIE DISNEY DUMPED sits at $83.2 million. Never forget that the Disney Grooming Syndicate owned Sound of Freedom and then tried to disappear it. Because Jim Caviezel doesn\u2019t age, it\u2019s hard to tell, but Sound of Freedom wrapped in 2018, more than five years ago. When Disney acquired 20th Century Fox in 2019, Disney acquired Sound of Freedom, a movie that is about to become one of the most profitable independent movies of all time. Obviously, a demonic company like Disney, a company dedicated to grooming kids by sexualizing children\u2019s content with homosexuality, transsexuals, drag queens, and transvestites, does not want anything to do with a movie that depicts the sex trafficking of children as a bad thing. Disney is determined to normalize sex with children, not reinforce the idea that a child\u2019s innocence must be protected. So Disney shelved Sound of Freedom and sat on it. It took five years for the producers to get it back. Well, because the arc of history bends toward justice, the fetishists at Disney are about to lose a couple hundred million dollars on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Cucking Indiana Jones with a Sexless Co-Star No One Finds Appealing. At the same time, Sound of Freedom has become a money-printing machine. Everything after about $35 million is pure profit for Sound of Money \u2014 er, I mean Sound of Freedom. Already, the people behind this blockbuster have split about $50 million with theaters. That\u2019s $25 million clear and counting. With its theatrical run far from over, Sound of Freedom\u2019s domestic haul has already topped all but 24 of last year\u2019s biggest-grossing films, including Scream (2022), Morbius, the Best Picture winner Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Woman King, Death on the Nile, etc. Elsewhere at this weekend\u2019s box office, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One came in below its $90 to $100 million projection with an $80 million haul over an extended five-day opening. If you do not adjust for inflation, that\u2019s a franchise record. Twenty-three years ago, Mission: Impossible II opened to $79 million. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $140 million today. The good news for Dead Reckoning is the overseas box office. After just five days, by Monday, it should have a worldwide haul of around $240 million. For context, that $240 million nearly ties the worldwide gross of Dial of Kathleen Kennedy\u2019s Latest Franchise-Killing Dud, after 16 days and two full weekends of release. The bad news for Dead Reckoning is that its production budget is a reported $290 million. Add another $100 million or so for promotion, and you\u2019re pretty close to the reported $430 million the Disney Grooming Syndicate spent on Dial of Dud. In its third weekend, Dial of Watch Us Emasculate Your Childhood Hero grossed just $11 million for a domestic total of a pathetic $145 million. Kathleen Kennedy\u2019s latest failure won\u2019t come close to $200 million domestic or $500 million worldwide. Break-even is over $800 million. This is what happens to a studio when it becomes a slave to identity politics, fetishes, and perversions. Disney has a man in a dress working in the dress store for little girls at Disneyland.

The reviews and word of mouth are about as good as it gets. Oppenheimer and Barbie open next weekend, which is serious competition but not direct competition in the action arena. Everyone was expecting Top Gun: Maverick numbers for Dead Reckoning, but Maverick was something entirely different. No one had seen a Top Gun movie in 35 years. Moviegoers were curious about what had happened to \u201cMaverick\u201d and \u201cIceman.\u201d Who are they now? How has their world changed? There\u2019s a big difference between that and another one of those Mission: Impossible movies. Hollywood has franchised me out. I have full faith Dead Reckoning is non-woke and entertaining. That has nothing to do with my lack of excitement. My enthusiasm gap comes from the fact that I feel like I\u2019ve already seen Dead Reckoning two or three times already, back when it was called Fallout, Rogue Nation, and Ghost Protocol. Sound of Freedom is the way forward. A modest budget attached to an original story about a topic (be it falling in love or sex trafficking) normal people care about. All you have to do is execute the story well and not undermine it with off-putting gay sex, lectures, shaming, or any other type of woketardery. Sound of Freedom isn\u2019t making a fortune because it\u2019s Christian-themed. That certainly helps in an overwhelmingly Christian country, but only a handful of Christian-themed movies have grossed over $80 million. No, it\u2019s making money for the same reason Top Gun: Maverick made money. Normal people love movies, but Hollywood has stopped making movies for normal people. Normal people want to be moved, inspired, transported, and engrossed in well-told stories populated with interesting characters who are not defined by their racial identity or sexual habits. Nothing violates the storytelling spell more than scolding, virtue-signaling, two guys kissing, or a sense of smugness. This isn\u2019t a difficult formula. Hollywood managed to accomplish this for, oh, say, about a hundred years. This strike that has shut down Hollywood is the first time in five years Hollywood has given the public what it wants: no more Hollywood products. Sound of Freedom is the box office hit of the year, and Disney, which has lost close to a billion dollars on its last eight feature films, gave it up.

            "text": "Actress Emily Blunt recently revealed that she will be taking a break from acting in order to focus on spending time with her family. \u201cThis year I\u2019m not working,\u201d Blunt told Bruce Bozzi during an appearance on the Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi podcast. \u201cI worked quite a bit last year, and my oldest baby is 9, so we\u2019re in the last year of single digits, and I just feel there are cornerstones to their day that are so important when they\u2019re little.\u201d View this post on Instagram A post shared by Oppenheimer (@oppenheimermovie) \u201cAnd it\u2019s, \u2018Will you wake me up? Will you take me to school? Will you pick me up? Will you put me to bed?\u2019 And I just need to be there for all of them for a good stretch. And I just felt that in my bones,\u201d the actress added. Blunt, who shares daughters 9-year-old Hazel and 7-year-old Violet with her husband, actor John Krasinski, also explained that there is an \u201cemotional cost\u201d for both her and her daughters while she is working. \u201cI had a beautiful time on the projects I did last year, some were more intense than others, some were harder than others, some were more time consuming than others,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the ones that are time consuming, I think, for me, are becoming few and further between, because of just the emotional cost on me, on the kids, on balance,\u201d Blunt shared. Last month, Blunt told Harper\u2019s Bazaar that she has a strict policy of never being away from her daughters for more than two weeks at a time. \u201cBecause even though they\u2019re hardy, and they\u2019re used to this strange life, it\u2019s still rough on them when I have to go away,\u201d the actress said.

            "text": "In case you didn\u2019t already think Matt Damon and Luciana Barroso were a great team, the Oppenheimer actor just shared a story about his wife that will change your mind. During a recent interview with Jake Hamilton, the 52-year-old actor revealed the simple, yet life-changing advice he received from his wife after falling into a \u201cdepression\u201d over a project that wasn\u2019t turning out the way he\u2019d hoped. \u201cI think, without naming any particular movies, that sometimes you find yourself in a movie that you know perhaps might not be what you had hoped it would be, and you\u2019re still making it,\u201d Damon said, per Today. \u201cHalfway through production and you\u2019ve still got months to go, and you\u2019ve taken your family somewhere, and you\u2019ve inconvenienced them. And I remember my wife pulling me up because I fell into a depression about, like, what have I done?\u201d But Barroso didn\u2019t let the Good Will Hunting writer and star spiral. \u201cShe just said, \u2018We\u2019re here now,\u2019\u201d Damon said. \u201cI do pride myself, in a large part because of her, at being a professional actor. And what being a professional actor means is you go and you do the 15-hour day and give it absolutely everything, even in what you know is going to be a losing effort. If you can do that with the best possible attitude, then you\u2019re a pro, and she really helped me with that.\u201d",

            "text": "Mark Ruffalo has raged against Hollywood \u201cfat cats\u201d who he said \u201cbelieve we [actors] are no longer of value\u201d. The 13 Going on 30 star made the remark in a series of tweets about the actors\u2019 strike that has effectively shut down Hollywood. Negotiators for the SAG-AFTRA union unanimously recommended a strike after talks with studios broke down. Scripted TV and movie production ceased immediately in the first dual work stoppage by both actors and writers in 63 years. The Writers Guild of America has been on strike since early May. Both groups demand increases in base pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus assurances that their work will not be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). Both unions are in dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Fran Drescher, former star of The Nanny and the president of SAG-AFTRA, said studios\u2019 responses to the actors\u2019 concerns had been \u201cinsulting and disrespectful\u201d. George Clooney has led A-listers voicing support for the strike, and Jason Sudeikis and Susan Sarandon are among the stars who have been seen on the picket line. Succession actor Brian Cox, meanwhile, has warned that the actors\u2019 strike could get \u201cvery unpleasant\u201d. The cast of Oppenheimer left a London premiere prematurely on Thursday night (13 July) to \u201cgo and write their picket signs\u201d. Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Igercondemned the threatened strike action as \u201cvery disruptive\u201d at the \u201cworst time\u201d as well as calling the expectations of writers and actors \u201cjust not realistic\u201d.",

            "title": "Here Are The Films And TV Shows That Have Been Shut Down Due To The Hollywood Actors' Strike",
            "text": "The effects of the ongoing strikes in Hollywood are being felt across the entertainment world. While a number of projects were already facing delays due to the writers\u2019 strike that began earlier in the year, last week saw the Screen Actors\u2019 Guild announcing that its members would also be withdrawing their labour. As a result, several TV shows and films that were underway \u2013 either because their scripts were complete before the writers\u2019 strike came into effect or, in one notable case, because it went ahead despite the strike \u2013 have now had their productions shut down. On Thursday evening, the cast of Oppenheimer left the film\u2019s London premiere midway through after the strike was confirmed to be in effect. With promotional appearances and interviews off the cards, you can expect the cast of other summer blockbusters like Barbie to be going silent as their films approach release. The premiere of Disney\u2019s new film The Haunted Mansion did go ahead on Saturday night \u2013 but with none of its cast in attendance. Shortly after this, the upcoming 12th season of American Horror Story \u2013 starring Kim Kardashian and Emma Roberts \u2013 halted production in New York. The show had continued shooting despite the writers\u2019 strike, and was recently picketed by members of the Writers\u2019 Guild of America. The third Deadpool film \u2013 starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in what has been billed as his final outing as Wolverine \u2013 was among the first films to have its production shut down, as well as the film adaptation of Wicked. Wicked cast members Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey were spotted at the Wimbledon final on Sunday, days after the strike was confirmed to be going ahead. Both of those films had been shooting in the UK, as was the new Beetlejuice sequel, with Variety reporting that while work on the film here in Britain was almost done, one additional sequence across the pond was still to be filmed before the strike came into effect. The media outlet also named Gladiator 2, Disney\u2019s live-action remake of Lilo & Stitch, the second part of Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning and the video game adaptations Mortal Kombat 2 and Minecraft as films affected by the strike. Venom 3, Clint Eastwood\u2019s new movie Juror #2 and the Blake Lively drama It Ends With Us had also begun filming before the strike was enacted. Meanwhile, several popular TV series were already on hold due to the writers strike, with shows like Emily In Paris, Euphoria, The Last Of Us, Stranger Things and The White Lotus expected to be delayed even further due to the latest action. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that House Of The Dragon is not among them. Not only did the Game Of Thrones prequel series dodge being affected by the writers\u2019 strike by completing scripts before it all unfolded, its predominantly-British cast are members of Equity, meaning they can\u2019t take part in the SAG strike.",

For those unversed, film producers Rehman and MN Kumar have accused Kiccha of cheating. A few days back, Rehman alleged that the Vikrant Rona actor took money from him and did not return. Before that MN Kumar cried foul that the actor has taken his remuneration in full for a film, which is yet to be greenlit. In fact, Kiccha had also filed a defamation case against MN Kumar. Recently, the actor appeared at a court in Bengaluru related to the case. While speaking to media persons outside the court, Kiccha reportedly said, \"I would not have survived in the industry for such a long period of time if I had committed mistakes.

Post the success of Huchcha (Kiccha's 2001 film), I invested about Rs 30 lakh in buying the remake rights of Hindi films to do it in Kannada with Sudeepa in the lead role, based on his suggestions, but it did not happen because of several reasons. Rs 5 lakh was paid in advance, out of which I got only Rs 1.80 lakh. I did not get the money back. I request him to return the money as I am in financial crisis now.\" View this post on Instagram The producer also revealed that he tried to buy the rights of Swarg after the Vikrant Rona actor approached him. Later, on the actor's suggestion, he also reportedly tried to buy the rights of Andaz Aapna Aapna. The producer said that he lost Rs 35 lakh on remakes but all the projects got shelved. Reportedly, Rehman also mentioned that he tried reach to Sudeepa several times but there was no response from the actor. The producer also said that he visited Sudeepa's home around 150 times but whenever he went, the actor was unavailable or he refused to meet him.

Speaking in an interview on the Max series Smartless: On The Road (via CinemaBlend), the Bourne franchise alum Damon said: \u201cThere are the Tom Cruises of the world, who do their stunts, like literally hang off a plane and do that.

The 30-year-old Pillowtalk singer is gearing up to drop a new single, Love Like This, two years after his third studio album was released and his first track since 2021. In a new Instagram post, Zayn gazes at the camera as he stands in front of a building in an empty parking space. Different people appear on the screen as a snippet of the song -releasing on July 21 - plays in the background. In the short clip, Zayn rocked a black-and-red leather jacket, a plain black t-shirt, and a thick silver necklace. He donned a short crop with a goatee as he posed for the video. Fans were delighted with the news of new music and rushed to the comment section to share their excitement. \"I just love how he comes back stronger every time!!\" one user said while another added: \"Sounds SO good mate, congrats & welcome back.\" With his song releasing on the same day as Barbie and Oppenheimer, one user commented: \"SO EXCITED FOR ZARBENHEIMER.\" \"This sounds like the Song of the Summer already, Zayn,\" one person said. It comes after Zayn opened up about the real reason he left One Direction. He was part of the boyband who were put together by Simon Cowell on The X Factor and came third in the competition back in 2010. The group went on to become one of the best-selling boybands of all time, selling over 70 million records worldwide. They received seven Brit Awards, seven American Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, and four MTV Video Music Awards, among others thanks to their hit tracks like Live While We're Young, Little Things and What Makes You Beautiful. In 2015, Zayn revealed that he was leaving the band and two years later, remaining members Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson also went on indefinite hiatus. Speaking on the Call Her Daddy podcast in a rare interview, Zayn revealed his real reason for leaving the band explaining that he \"selfishly\" wanted to get \"ahead of the curve\". \"There was a lot of politics going on, certain people were doing certain things, some people didn\u2019t want to sign contracts, so I knew something was happening so I just got ahead of the curve, if I\u2019m being honest with you, I was like 'I\u2019m just going to get out of here, I think this is done,'\" he admitted. \"I selfishly wanted to be the first person to go and make my own record. I wanted to jump the gun for the first time, I\u2019m the passive dude but when it comes to music and my business, I\u2019m serious about it, I\u2019m competitive and I wanted to be the first to go and do my own thing. \"There was obviously underlying issues within our friendships too, we'd been together every day for five years and we got sick of each other,\" Zayn added.

            "text": "Matt Damon, the star of Oppenheimer, recently recalled a humorous interaction with Tom Cruise, the hero of Mission: Impossible, in which Cruise revealed that he replaced a safety person in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol so he could proceed with the movie\u2019s very risky Burj Khalifa stunt. Speaking in an interview on the Max series Smartless: On The Road, the Bourne franchise alum Damon said: \u201cThere are the Tom Cruises of the world, who do their stunts, like literally hang off a plane and do that. I remember I had dinner with him once and it was after he did the [Mission: Impossible movie] where he ran around the building. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Can you tell me how that happened?\u2019 And he\u2019s a really intense guy and he was like, \u2018I\u2019ll tell you how it happened!\u2019 I go, \u2018Alright.\u2019 And I\u2019m in.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking about this photo for 15 years,\u2019 he declares. I think, \u201cWow, really?\u201d So I go to the safety guy and I lay it all out,\u201d he continues. \u2018We can\u2019t do that,\u2019 the safety man says. You can\u2019t do it; it\u2019s too risky. So I hire a new safety expert. The beginning of his story is there. \u201cAnd I simply say, \u2018Stop!'\u201d That is where our differences lie. When the safety guy says no, I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, safety guy says it\u2019s not a good idea.'\u201d As one of the most risk-taking performers to ever work in Hollywood, Cruise has developed a solid reputation. Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, his most recent entry in the series, is currently doing well in theatres.",

            "text": "On Friday, The View was pre-recorded, scaring fans into wondering if the show would join the SAG-AFTRA strike that's been occurring since last Thursday. Whoopi Goldberg however had an answer for die-hard View fans, holding their breath. She started the show on Monday by saying: \"Hello and welcome to The View. Listen, we want to start with an explanation on why we're still working when there is a SAG-AFTRA strike.\" \"Like the soaps, soap operas, game shows, and new shows, we work under a different kind of contract, which is called the Network Code, which means we are allowed to continue on.\" After the show aired on Friday, fans of the show quickly went to Twitter to write about their concerns. \"Do we know if the hosts are striking? Today was pre-recorded, so it's hard to tell,\" one tweet said. On Thursday, President of SAG-AFTRA Fran Drescher, known for her starring role in The Nanny, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, announced that the national board voted unanimously to strike. \"The gig is up,\" said Drescher. She addressed the AMPTP, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, after failing to reach a deal with them: \"They plead poverty, that they\u2019re losing money left and right, when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting \u2014 shame on them.\" Many actors have joined the strike, even the cast of Oppenheimer walked out early during their London premiere when the strike was announced. But with The View, the show must go on. It also continued after the Writer's Guild of America went on strike in May, but sans writers. This is the first time in over 60 years that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA are on strike at the same time. \"As we are not actors at the table, acting The View, it's a different kind of contract,\" Whoopi continued. She did show her support for the strike, saying: \"Nobody wants to see anyone on strike.\" The View is hosted by Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Ana Navarro, Sunny Hostin, Alyssa Farah Griffin, and Whoopi, who has been a member since 2007 and has come under a lot of controversy in the past for things she's said on the show. The most recent controversy is when she made comments about the Holocaust, saying it was not based on race but \"about man's inhumanity to man.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.",

            "text": "They couldn\u2019t get it off the ground. In a new profile in The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cNew Girl\u201d alum Jake Johnson opens up about the best TV show he never made \u2014 and why he was shocked when the promising pilot crash-landed. Best-known for his role as the grumpy, lovable Nick Miller, who fumbled his way through seven seasons of the Zooey Deschanel sitcom, Johnson is back on our screens (and in our hearts) for season 2 of \u201cMinx,\u201d where he stars as a sleazy \u201970s publisher behind the first erotic magazine for women. But according to Johnson, a failed pilot he shot for Apple TV+ could\u2019ve been his biggest hit. Before it was shot down due to budgeting constraints in the early days of the pandemic, the show \u2014 another \u201970s-set sitcom, this one about a cult \u2014 was met with rave reviews. Johnson laughed, remembering how he got ahead of himself, after the pilot\u2019s early reviews. \u201cI\u2019m finally getting the respect I deserve,\u201d Johnson recalled thinking, adding that he \u201cdidn\u2019t even think there was an option of [the show] not getting picked up.\u201d He pictured the accolades awaiting his return to the small screen. \u201cMy only thought was, \u2018How do they tell \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 that they just got knocked off the Apple pedestal? \u2018I just feel bad for Jen Aniston,'\u201d he remembered thinking. Needless to say, it came as a surprise to hear that the show was D.O.A. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019d already won every award and changed the game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThen I get the call that they\u2019re not moving forward. You panic\u2026And then, very quickly, you realize it\u2019s dead.\u201d Since then, Johnson has contended with more successes and failures. \u201cMinx\u201d turned a profit for Max, but the streamer canceled the show nonetheless. Then came the news that it would be picked up by Starz for a second season, which just so happens to premiere on July 21, or \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d Day, when the \u2018Barbie\u2019 film and \u2018Oppenheimer are both set to be released. These days, Johnson said he doesn\u2019t put the cart before the horse. Currently, he is focused on his upcoming directorial debut, \u201cSelf Reliance.\u201d",

            "text": "New York (CNN) \u2014 Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the SEC to investigate Tesla and its board of directors to determine whether they violated securities laws after CEO Elon Musk took over Twitter last year. In a nine-page letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission Monday, the Massachusetts senator said Elon Musk\u2019s long list of responsibilities, from owning Twitter to remaining Tesla\u2019s CEO, \u201chave raised concerns about conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and other negative impacts to Tesla shareholders.\u201d Warren added that the electric car company\u2019s board failed to ensure it has acted in shareholders\u2019 best interests. Chief among Warren\u2019s concerns in the letter: funneling Tesla (TSLA) resources into Musk\u2019s Twitter takeover, conflicts of interest regarding advertising from other car companies, and possible labor law violations when transitioning some Tesla (TSLA) employees to Twitter. Warren is asking SEC chair Gary Gensler to conduct the review. Although former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino took over as the new CEO of Twitter last month, Musk has retained significant control over the site. Some investors and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned about Musk\u2019s chaotic control of Twitter, which he bought for $44 billion. Warren wrote that that disorder has spilled over into Musk\u2019s management of one of the most influential electric car companies in the United States. Oppenheimer & Co. downgraded its rating on Tesla solely because of risks posed by the billionaire\u2019s ownership and management of Twitter in 2022. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Friday, tech investor Cathie Wood said she wrote down her Twitter stake by 47%. Warren noted Twitter relies on advertising from Tesla\u2019s direct competitors, such as Audi (AUDVF) and GM (GM), creating a conflict of interest as the platform is trying to shore up funds. A group of 17 major Tesla investors in April wrote an open letter to the company\u2019s board complaining Musk is just too distracted to run the company. \u201cTesla is publicly owned, and Mr. Musk and the Board have responsibilities to shareholders and the public in their management of the company,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cMr. Musk\u2019s personal wealth \u2013 and his personal relationships with Board members \u2013 do not shield him or the Tesla Board from meeting basic SEC governance and disclosure rules.\u201d Warren argues Tesla\u2019s board failed to hold its CEO accountable. Because Tesla is a public company, unlike Twitter, it has to have an independent board that will represent investors\u2019 best interests. But the board may not be truly independent, Warren says \u2013 the eight-member group includes Musk himself, his brother, a former Tesla executive, and two longtime friends of Musk, the senator wrote. \u201cThese close relationships may explain the board\u2019s persistent inability or unwillingness to address the concerns posed by Mr. Musk\u2019s actions,\u201d Warren wrote. It\u2019s not the first time Warren has called out Musk and Tesla\u2019s board. Last December, the Democratic senator wrote Tesla shareholders may be hurt by its CEO\u2019s ownership of Twitter in a letter to company chair Robyn Denholm. In that missive, Warren posed a series of questions about how Tesla\u2019s board is dealing with \u201cconflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets and other actions by Mr. Musk that appear not to be in the best interests of Tesla and its shareholders.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment.

            "text": "Matt Damon will not be sleeping on the couch for the next week. The \u201cOppenheimer\u201d star told Willie Geist of \u201cSunday Today\u201d that he feels he has an innate talent outside of the entertainment industry. \u201cI feel like if I\u2019m good at anything, it\u2019s, like, picking partners,\u201d the actor told Geist. Damon then named his best friend and frequent collaborator, Ben Affleck, wife Luciana Barroso \u2014 with whom he shares four daughters \u2014 and his fellow water access activist and Water.org co-founder, Gary White. \u201cBetween Ben and my wife and Gary White ...Those are the three most significant partnerships in my life. And all those things are going really well,\u201d Damon said with a laugh. But things got a little squirmy when Geist pressed him to name his most significant partnership out of the three. Damon did an excellent job at skirting the question at first (and presumably giving him time to figure out how all three would react to him rating their importance in his life) but ultimately made the wise choice: the mother of his children. \u201cObviously, my wife,\u201d Damon said. \u201cThere you go,\u201d Geist said with a laugh, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s where I was helping you out there.\u201d \u201cThat was a layup,\u201d Damon said, calling him out. Although Affleck tends to wear his heart on his back sleeve, here\u2019s hoping he doesn\u2019t take his second-place (or, hey, third-place) trophy too badly. Plus, we know how Damon could make it up to his BFF. In 2019, Damon proved his love for his daughters was eternal when he got all four of their names tattooed on his right upper arm. Their names appear close to a preexisting \u201cLucy\u201d tattoo, which he previously got in honor of Luciana. \u201cOn a whim, my wife said, \u2018We\u2019re going to get tattoos today,\u2019 so I got a tattoo of her name,\u201d Damon told \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d of his body art. \u201cAnd it always felt alone on my arm, and I\u2019ve always wanted to put the kids on there.\u201d He added, \u201cSo now I got the kids on there, and now I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to pull it all together.\u201d May we suggest he ties it all together with a \u201cBen\u201d tattoo? Do it, Matt! He\u2019s a sensitive man, and we don\u2019t want a repeat of this",

            "title": "A cruise ship 2.5 times the length of Croke Park \u2013 7 wild facts about Icon of the Seas",
            "text": "One image especially seems to have captured the public's imagination: a rear-end view that looks like a towering layer cake topped with silly string. \"The physical manifestation of Barbenheimer,\" wrote one Twitter user, referring to the release of the Barbie movie and \"Oppenheimer,\" about the development of the atomic bomb, on the same day. \"Nightmare clown lasagna,\" wrote another. Many invoked the Northern European painter Hieronymus Bosch, Dante's \"Inferno\" and hamster cages. A smattering said it looked like actual fun. Tanner Callais, founder and editor of cruise information site Cruzely, said in an email that it's no surprise the behemoth is creating buzz. \"Looking at those renderings, I think the ship almost looks like a cartoon with the huge water park at the back,\" he said. \"It's just unreal that something like that can be built to sail the ocean.\" Whatever the impression it's leaving, cruise line Royal Caribbean International says Icon, which completed initial sea trials in June, is selling like mad. The company reported its single largest booking day when reservations opened in October; sales have since set two more records. The Miami-based company is no stranger to setting records: Royal Caribbean has brought several \"world's largest\" ships to market, notably the Oasis of the Seas in 2009, which dwarfed all others in its wake. Additional iterations have been slightly larger than the original, and even Icon of the Seas will only be 10 feet longer than its closest runner-up. Travel adviser Danny Genung, CEO of Harr Travel, said he was up in the middle of the night booking trips for clients when reservations opened. He snagged a spot on the inaugural voyage for himself. \"There's never been a ship launch like this in the industry,\" he said. Here are seven standout stats about the ship. 1. It can hold 5,610 passengers That's not including crew. That's a few hundred more people than the population of Bar Harbor, Maine, which is US News & World Report's top small town in the United States to visit this year. Crew adds another 2,350 to the total. And because ships are designed to accommodate more than two people per room with additional beds for families or groups, the total guest capacity is actually a whopping 7,600. When Oasis of the Seas was introduced as the biggest ship in the world in 2009, its capacity at double occupancy was 5,400 guests. The average capacity for the 44 ships being introduced between this year and 2028 is 2,749 passengers, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. 2. It's nearly 1,200 feet long The ship is only 10 feet longer than previous biggest-ship record-holders at 1,198 feet. But that\u2019s still 2.5 times the length of the pitch at Croke Park (at 145m, or 476 feet) or nearly four Statues of Liberty, pedestals included. To visualise another way, the ship's length is almost exactly three times the height of Dublin\u2019s Spire, which stands almost 400 feet tall on O\u2019Connell Street. 3. It has more than five times the tonnage of the Titanic Cruise ships are ranked according to gross tonnage, the measure of internal volume. This is where Icon of the Seas really outshines the competition, at 250,800 gross tons. The next-closest is Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, which comes in at 235,600. To compare, the Titanic was 46,329 gross tons. 4. It has more than a dozen decks Icon of the Seas will feature 20 decks, 18 of which are for guest use. Those decks encompass eight \"neighbourhoods\", including a Central Park packed with live plants; a massive water park; a three-deck cluster of pools; a massive dome featuring a waterfall and performances and an area for families with young kids to play and eat. The next-largest ship in Royal Caribbean's fleet, Wonder of the Seas, has 18 decks, all but two of which are for guests. 5. There's a pool for every day of the week There will be seven pools on the ship, including a swim-up bar, suspended infinity pool and what Royal Caribbean describes as the \"largest pool at sea.\" Voyager of the Seas, which was the world's largest in 1999 when it launched, has three pools. 6. It has the biggest water park on the water Royal Caribbean is boasting that Icon will have the \"largest waterpark at sea,\" called Category 6. That refers to hurricane strength (which tops out at Category 5) but also the six slides on board. There's an open free-fall slide, a 46-foot drop slide, family raft slides and a pair of mat-racing slides. \"Everybody now has a waterslide or two but having a water park with six slides that would be as good on land as they are on sea, it's really unheard of,\" Genung said. In a 2022 roundup of best cruise ship water parks, Cruise Critic highlights Carnival. Many of its ships offer a trio of slides. MSC Cruises comes close to Icon's number on some of its recent ships, offering four or five slides, and the cruise site notes that some of Norwegian Cruise Line's ships have up to five waterslides. 7. There are 40 places to eat and drink yourself silly Cruise ships have expanded their food and beverage options in recent years far beyond just a buffet, main dining room and pool bar. Icon will offer more than 40 ways to \"drink, dine and be entertained,\" including 15 bars and nightlife experiences and more than 20 dining options. Restaurants on board run the gamut from an eight-course supper club experience to an all-day brunch spot to sushi and street food, a steakhouse and, yes, buffets. Reflecting cruise passengers' appetite for variety, this total is actually on par with the current record-holder, Wonder of the Seas. For a land-based comparison, Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas says on its website that it offers 21 restaurants and 19 bars and lounges. Genung, the travel agency CEO, said he has clients who say the ship looks amazing but too big for them. \"You get all the scope of reactions: 'That's cool, that's crazy; I can't wait to do it, I would never want to do that,'\" he said. But he said especially for multigenerational families who want to travel together, it's a great fit. \"The thing with this is it's a perfect cruise for lots at different people at different times in life,\" he said.",

            "text": "Matt Damon will not be sleeping on the couch for the next week. The Oppenheimer star told Willie Geist of Sunday Today that he feels he has an innate talent outside of the entertainment industry. \u201cI feel like if I\u2019m good at anything, it\u2019s, like, picking partners,\u201d he told the host. Matt then named his best friend and frequent collaborator, Ben Affleck, wife Luciana Barroso \u2014 with whom he shares four daughters \u2014 and his fellow water access activist and Water.org co-founder, Gary White. \u201cBetween Ben and my wife and Gary White ...Those are the three most significant partnerships in my life. And all those things are going really well,\u201d Matt said with a laugh. But things got a little squirmy when Willie pressed him to name his most significant partnership out of the three. Matt did an excellent job at skirting the question at first (and presumably giving him time to figure out how all three would react to him rating their importance in his life) but ultimately made the wise choice: the mother of his children. \u201cObviously, my wife,\u201d Matt said. \u201cThere you go,\u201d Willie said with a laugh, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s where I was helping you out there.\u201d \u201cThat was a layup,\u201d Matt said, calling him out. Although Ben tends to wear his heart on his back sleeve, here\u2019s hoping he doesn\u2019t take his second-place (or, hey, third-place) trophy too badly. Plus, we know how Matt could make it up to his BFF. In 2019, he proved his love for his daughters was eternal when he got all four of their names tattooed on his right upper arm. Their names appear close to a preexisting \u201cLucy\u201d tattoo, which he previously got in honour of Luciana. \u201cOn a whim, my wife said, \u2018We\u2019re going to get tattoos today,\u2019 so I got a tattoo of her name,\u201d Matt told Access Hollywood of his body art. \u201cAnd it always felt alone on my arm, and I\u2019ve always wanted to put the kids on there.\u201d He added: \u201cSo now I got the kids on there, and now I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to pull it all together.\u201d May we suggest he ties it all together with a \u201cBen\u201d tattoo? Do it, Matt! He\u2019s a sensitive man, and we don\u2019t want a repeat of this",

            "title": "Tired of Boppenheimer? Here are this year\u2019s other major film releases to get excited about",
            "text": "The marketing campaigns of two of this year\u2019s biggest films, which will both be released in three days, have been undeniably successful. Not only does it seem like half of London has turned pink, but the same-day release of the two contrasting films has become a major talking point around both office water coolers and in Whatsapp groups: on Boppenheimer or Barbenheimer day (July 21), does one see Barbie or Oppenheimer first? It\u2019s been a lot. While some people are on board for all the Boppenheimer content, others are completely exhausted. If that\u2019s you, fear not. It\u2019s all going to be over very soon. And happily, there are a tonne of other fantastic films coming up this year: from Martin Scorsese\u2019s Twenties murder-drama, Killers of the Flower Moon, to Ridley Scott\u2019s historical epic, Napoleon. So hang tight, regular scheduling will commence soon. Here\u2019s our pick of some of the biggest films coming this year. British filmmaker Gareth Edwards, who made the 2016 Star Wars blockbuster, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, turns his attention to another space-focused project in The Creator. The film couldn\u2019t be more topical: it tells the story of a future war where humans are battling AI. It\u2019s the job of special agent Joshua (John David Washington) to track down The Creator \u2013 a programmer with the power to develop advanced AI that will wipe out humanity. With Hans Zimmer composing the film\u2019s score, and Edwards writing the screenplay alongside Chris Weitz (About a Boy, The Golden Compass, Pinocchio) The Creator is set to be one of the year\u2019s most exciting releases. Gemma Chan, Ken Watanabe, Allison Janney and Ralph Ineson also star. Martin Scorsese\u2019s latest project, Killers of the Flower Moon, is a whopping three and a half hour crime-drama set in Twenties Oklahoma, telling the story of the murders of dozens of Native Americans that took place in the state around the same time that oil was discovered on its land. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a war vet who goes to Oklahoma to meet his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro), a cattleman and businessman, to try and find work. The crime drama, which has been written by Scorsese alongside Eric Roth \u2013 who also wrote Forrest Gump (1994), The Insider (1999), Munich (2005) and Dune (2021) \u2013 will also star Brendan Fraser, Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, singer Jack White, Louis Cancelmi, Lily Gladstone and Tantoo Cardinal. The early reviews have heaped praise on 80-year-old Scorsese: \u201cMartin Scorsese has made an arresting masterpiece,\u201d said The Standard. \u201cThis movie is bound to be controversial. And the genius who made it wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d David Yates has spent the last 16 years on Harry Potter projects: first he directed the last four Harry Potter films, then he directed the three Fantastic Beasts Wizarding World prequel films. Now the director turns his talents to a very different kind of movie. Pain Hustlers is based on a 2018 New York Times Magazine article, and follows the story of high school drop out Liza Drake, who lands a new job which ends up drawing her into a far-reaching criminal conspiracy. Emily Blunt plays Drake, while Chris Evans, Andy Garc\u00eda, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Jay Duplass and Brian d\u2019Arcy James also star. In 2021, Denis Villeneuve did what no director had been able to do before: he managed to successfully adapt Frank Herbert\u2019s Sixties science fiction novel, Dune, for the silver screen. With a cast that included Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Chang Chen, Charlotte Rampling and Dave Bautista, Villeneuve told the complicated story of the rise and fall of House Atreides, a noble family who has been asked by the Emperor to take over the running of Arrakis in lieu of the malevolent House Harkonnen. The film was a huge success, making $402 million at the Box Office. This November the second chapter is released. Picking up from part one, now Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya\u2019s characters, Paul and Chani, must grapple with their destiny as Paul adapts to his new life on the incredibly hazardous and inhospitable desert planet Arrakis. David Fincher, the director behind Seven (1995), Fight Club (1999), Zodiac (2007), The Social Network (2010) and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), is a master of the thriller genre, which means his next project, The Killer, a psychological action thriller starring Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton, is likely to be another winner. The film, which is an adaptation of the French Nineties graphic novel series, has been written by Seven writer Andrew Kevin Walker. It will tell the story of an assassin who starts to have a crisis of conscience. The Marvels, the sequel to 2019\u2019s Captain Marvel, finally lands in cinemas this November. Brie Larson returns to play Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel and Samuel L. Jackson returns to play Nick Fury. Meanwhile, Teyonah Parris is Monica Rambeau, an astronaut working for Fury, and Iman Vellani\u2018s Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel also turns up. It goes without saying that every time a Marvel film drops it becomes one of the major releases of the year, and The Marvels promises to be no different: Captain Marvel made $1.131 billion at the Box Office. It\u2019s been eight years since The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2 was released, meaning that Hunger Games fans have been on absolute tenterhooks waiting for the release of the franchise\u2019s next film. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which is based on Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins\u2019 2020 novel, is a spin-off of the original storyline, focusing on the earlier life of Coriolanus Snow, who will later become president. At this point in the story he\u2019s 18 years old and is assigned to mentor tribute Lucy Gray Baird. There\u2019s an almost brand new cast, including Tom Blyth who will play Snow, Rachel Zegler as Baird, Peter Dinklage, Hunter Schafer, Jason Schwartzman, Viola Davis and Fionnula Flanagan, but director Francis Lawrence, who has been behind the camera since 2013\u2019s The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, returns to direct. Then next up is Ridley Scott\u2019s latest epic, Napoleon, which will star Joaquin Phoenix as the French emperor. Napoleon will tell the story of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s rise to power \u2013 battles and war strategy aplenty \u2013 while also focusing on his volatile relationship with his wife Empress Jos\u00e9phine. Phoenix will play Napoleon, while Vanessa Kirby will play Jos\u00e9phine. The film looks like it\u2019s going to be a cracker: it has been written by David Scarpa, who wrote The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) and All the Money in the World (2017). And if the trailer is anything to go by \u2013 think slow motion battle scenes, cannon fire and explosions, raucous and angry (French) crowds, incredible costumes, exquisite sets (which include deserts and palaces) and snogging \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a real humdinger. When the trailer for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s next film, Wonka, dropped six days ago it surprised some of his fans. There was little known about the upcoming film, other than that it was going to explore Willy Wonka\u2019s early life. Nevertheless, fans had expected a dark origin story of sorts. This was not that: Chalamet is singing, there are large-scale choreographed dance sequences, and the trailer seems to promise a feel-good kids movie, dropping just in time for Christmas. Given that the film has been made by Paddington director Paul King, perhaps this should have been expected. But Chalamet\u2019s past roles \u2013 such as in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s Bones and All, where he plays a young cannibal \u2013 lead audiences to believe his take on Wonka might be less lighthearted. Similarly, author Roald Dahl\u2019s Willy Wonka is an eccentric character, giving lots of scope for actors to make the role their own. Either way, it\u2019s one to mark in the diary: who doesn\u2019t want to see Chalamet run around Oxford dressed as the peculiar inventor, with a supporting cast including Matt Lucas, Olivia Colman, Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa and Sally Hawkins.",

Credit: Supplied Australians swipe plastic on fantastic Barbie merchandise despite RBA calls to cut spending Jay HannaPerthNow July 19, 2023 2:00AM Comments TopicsMoviesCelebrityEntertainmentShopping Forget the box office showdown of Barbie vs Oppenheimer \u2014 the iconic doll might be saving her knockout punch for Philip Lowe. While the Reserve Bank boss has been urging Australians to cut spending to get inflation under control for months, Barbie has consumers in a tizz as they rush to swipe their plastic faster than you can say, she\u2019s fantastic. The 64-year-old doll \u2014 which will set you back anywhere from $13 to $60 or tens of thousands for a vintage doll in its original box \u2014 has shifted more than a billion units since its launch in 1959 and has never really strayed far from merchandise aisles. But Barbie is surfing a new wave of popularity thanks to the first live-action film starring and produced by Aussie superstar Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig. And make no mistake that wave is Mattel\u2019s copyrighted Barbie Pink (that\u2019s Pantone 219C in case you were wondering). If you\u2019ve been walking around shopping centres with your eyes closed, you may have failed to notice that Barbie is everywhere right now. There\u2019s barely a shop front that doesn\u2019t have Barbie merchandise splashed across its window display.Camera IconBarbie The Movie product shots. Michael Wilson Credit: Michael Wilson/The West Australian The marketing has been intense, innovative and inescapable. Internationally, Mattel and Warner Bros. have inked hundreds of brand partnerships with everyone from US giants Bloomingdales to global heavyweights Revlon, OPI, Vans and Crocs. Closer to home you\u2019ll see Dotti, Cotton On, Jay Jays and Peter Alexander offering Barbie-themed clothing, pyjamas, jewellery and drink bottles.Camera IconBarbie - Crocs classic clogs Credit: supplied/suppliedCamera IconBarbie - Peter Alexander I Love Barbie Pj Set Credit: supplied/supplied Even Zara has got in on the craze turning their New York and Paris stores into immersive Barbie pop-ups and launching a classic Barbie capsule collection comprising pink denim two pieces, retro black and white swimsuits and shimmery evening dresses. The fashion and make-up collaborations were somewhat to be expected as fans got on board the Barbiecore fashion trend, but the addition of Glasshouse Barbie-themed fragrances, Ruggable Barbie toned rug, Barbie XBox, Barbie Impala Rollerskates and Barbie and Ken popping up on dating app Bumble proves the marketing push surrounding the brand has been groundbreaking and ubiquitous. You can even head to Grill\u2019d for a Barbie Dreamburger with pink mayonnaise. The Barbiecore dress code was well and truly embraced by the Perthonalities, media and influencers who gathered for the film\u2019s Perth premiere on Monday night.Camera IconBarbie Premiere at Event Cinemas Innaloo on July 17th, 2023.

Hair was perfectly coiffed likely using Mermade Hair\u2019s Barbie Blowout Kit while OPI was on hand to paint the town\u2019s nails pink with their Hi Barbie nail polish. So why has the world gone Barbie crazy? There\u2019s no doubt a myriad of reasons. The film itself is expected to have widespread appeal. Both Robbie and Gerwig are respected names within the industry and the film is touted as fun and inoffensive, if somewhat overly earnest, with blows to capitalism and sexism softened by 1950s-style musical sequences and a pop soundtrack featuring Dua Lipa, Charli XCX and Nicki Minaj.

            "title": "'This is the way the world ends': Nevil Shute's On the Beach warned us of nuclear annihilation. It's still a hot-button issue",
            "text": "One of the most haunting poems of the 20th century, T.S. Eliot\u2019s The Hollow Men (1925), concludes: This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper. In 1958, on his 70th birthday, Eliot was asked whether he would consider writing these lines, probably his most quoted, again. His answer was both noteworthy and categorical. He admitted he would not. He said that \u201cwhile the association of the H-bomb is irrelevant to it, it would today come to everyone\u2019s mind\u201d. (And he was \u201cnot sure that the world will end with either\u201d.) Indeed, Nevil Shute\u2019s classic novel of nuclear annihilation, On the Beach, published in June 1957, used Eliot\u2019s famous lines as an epigraph. And the nuclear threat is still very much at the top of our collective mind. The Sydney Theatre Company is staging the very first stage adaptation of Shute\u2019s novel. And Oppenheimer, one of 2023\u2019s two most-hyped films, tells the story of the man referred to as \u201cthe father of the atomic bomb\u201d. \u2018Australia\u2019s most important novel\u2019 Journalist Gideon Haigh calls On the Beach \u201carguably Australia\u2019s most important novel \u2013 important in the sense of confronting a mass international audience with the defining issue of the age\u201d. British-born Shute emigrated in 1950 to Australia, where he lived outside Melbourne. As well as writing novels, he worked as an aeronautical engineer. The title of On the Beach \u2013 which started life as a four-part story called The Last Days on Earth \u2013 ostensibly referred to a Royal Navy expression for reassignment. (Shute spent time in the Royal Naval Reserve during the second world war.) However, as readers of Eliot\u2019s poetry will know, the phrase also appears late in The Hollow Men: In this last of meeting places We grope together And avoid speech Gathered on this beach of the tumid river. As in Eliot\u2019s poem, the characters that cluster together in the pages of Shute\u2019s novel, set in and around Melbourne between 1962 and 1963, tend on occasion to avoid speech. This comes to the fore in the following passage, which focuses on a dinner party hosted by Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes of the Royal Australian Navy. The atmosphere is both claustrophobic and delirious: For three hours they danced and drank together, sedulously avoiding any serious topic of conversation. In the warm night the room grew hotter and hotter, coats and ties were jettisoned at an early stage, and the gramophone went on working through an enormous pile of records, half of which Peter had borrowed for the evening. In spite of the wide-open windows behind the fly wire, the room grew full of cigarette smoke. The reason why the guests at Peter\u2019s party are so keen to avoid serious talk is both simple and depressing. They are trying very hard to forget that they are all going to be dead from radiation poisoning in a matter of months. Shute brings the reader up to speed after the dinner party wraps up. A massive nuclear war has devastated the entire northern hemisphere, wiping out all forms of life there. And the radioactive fallout generated during the conflict is now creeping \u2013 slowly but surely \u2013 into the southern hemisphere. Shute makes it clear there is absolutely nothing anyone can do about this. In tonally dispassionate prose, he reveals that vast swathes of Australia have already been rendered uninhabitable due to radiation poisoning. The only thing the characters who remain can do is wait. As Moira Davidson says to the American submarine captain, Dwight Towers: \u201cIt\u2019s like waiting to be hung.\u201d Hence the desperate need for moments of temporary respite and distraction. Different characters deal with the situation in different ways. Those who still have jobs go to work. Those who don\u2019t, stay at home or go shopping. Some, like Moira, take to drink and rail uselessly against the unfairness of it all: \u2018I won\u2019t take it,\u2019 she said vehemently. \u2018It\u2019s not fair. No one in the Southern Hemisphere ever dropped a bomb, a hydrogen bomb or a cobalt bomb or any other sort of bomb. We had nothing to do with it. Why should we have to die because other countries nine or ten thousand miles away from us wanted to have a war? It\u2019s so bloody unfair.\u2019 Moira\u2019s anger eventually gives way to something approaching resignation. \u201cA tear trickled down beside her nose and she wiped it away irritably; self-pity was a stupid thing, or was it the brandy?\u201d She comes to accept this is \u201cthe end of it, the very, very end.\u201d Moments after this, Moira, who is already gravely ill with radiation poisoning, ends her life. She takes a couple of suicide tablets, puts them in her mouth, and washes them down \u201cwith a mouthful of brandy, sitting behind the wheel of her big car\u201d. This is the way Shute\u2019s novel of nuclear extinction ends: not with a bang but with a whimper. Released at the height of the Cold War, On the Beach struck a chord with millions of concerned readers. Read more: Even a 'limited' nuclear war would starve millions of people, new study reveals Usefully entertaining By the September of 1957, Shute\u2019s novel \u2013 which sold over 100,000 copies within six weeks of initial publication \u2013 had been serialised by dozens of American newspapers. A copy had found its way to the desk of John F. Kennedy, the next president of the United States. And Hollywood was about to call. Directed by Stanley Kramer, the cinematic adaptation of On the Beach \u2013 which was filmed on location in Victoria and showcased the talents of Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire \u2013 hit the big screen in December 1959. Shute famously detested the movie, which received decidedly mixed reviews. In a sense, Shute\u2019s response is surprising, as the novelist clearly wanted to get his message about the perils of nuclear war across to as wide an audience as possible. Shute\u2019s didactic inclinations are evident towards the end of the novel. \u201cPeter,\u201d the character Mary asks, \u201cwhy did this all this happen to us?\u201d Even at this late stage, Mary, whose radiation-racked body is spasming uncontrollably, wants to know whether things might have panned out differently. Her husband\u2019s reply is revealing: \u2018I don\u2019t know [\u2026] Some kinds of silliness you just can\u2019t stop,\u2019 he said. \u2018I mean, if a couple of hundred million people all decide that their national honour requires them to drop cobalt bombs upon their neighbour, well, there\u2019s not much that you or I can do about it. The only possible hope would have been to educate them out of their silliness.\u2019 Shute makes a similar point in a letter he wrote in 1960. He holds that a popular writer can often play the part of the enfant terrible in raising for the first time subjects which ought to be discussed in public and which no statesman cares to approach. In this way, an entertainer may serve a useful purpose. Knowing this, it seems likely Shute would have been delighted to read reviews that praised the book\u2019s \u201cemotional wallop\u201d while simultaneously demanding it \u201cbe made mandatory reading for all professional diplomats and politicians\u201d. While the science in the novel was somewhat flawed, Shute\u2019s cautionary tale undoubtedly spoke to the collective zeitgeist.

Enduring influence On the Beach was released mere months after the creation of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy in the United States, and just before the founding of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the United Kingdom. Though it seems fair to say Nevil Shute\u2019s general literary standing has diminished in recent years, On the Beach continues to exert a pull on the popular cultural imagination. The influence of Shute\u2019s novel, which was remade in 2000 as a film for Australian television, can be observed in various post-apocalyptic works, including George Miller\u2019s Mad Max franchise and the late Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road. (If anything, the ending of On the Beach is even bleaker than in McCarthy\u2019s masterpiece.) Shute\u2019s vision of humanity\u2019s self-inflicted destruction is eerily resonant in our time of climate emergency. The nuclear threat remains, too, in our perilous historical moment of democratic backsliding and failing nuclear states. It seems increasingly likely the world as we know it is coming to an end \u2013 if it hasn\u2019t already. The question remains: will it be with a bang or a whimper?

            "text": "It\u2019s difficult to believe Robert Downey Jr. could ever flop at an audition. However, it turns out that he lacked one particular skill deemed essential for the role of Graham in the 2006 rom-com The Holiday: a solid British accent. He recalled the incident with Jimmy Fallon on on Sunday\u2019s (July 16) \u201csurprise show\u201d of \u201cThe Howard Stern Show,\u201d that featured an array of celebs including Drew Barrymore and Jon Bon Jovi, among others. Downey Jr. explained that both him and Fallon got \u201ccalled in just as seat fillers\u201d to the audition for The Holiday by director Nancy Meyers, saying she \u201cneeded someone to read with the gals\u201d auditioning. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting there going, \u2018It\u2019s about to happen for us,\u2019\u201d Downey shared, who deemed himself a \u201cshoo-in\u201d for the role that ultimately went to British actor Jude Law. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to have a better English accent than Jude Law at this point,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd Winslet said, \u2018That was the worst British accent I\u2019ve ever heard.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I\u2019ll check out now, but I\u2019m taking the gummy bears from the minibar.\u2019\u201d The hilarious anecdote may have left Downey Jr. humiliated, but Fallon hyped him up and remembered thinking, \u201cWithout a doubt, this is the best actor I\u2019ve ever sat across from and did a scene with in my entire life.\u201d Fallon described the story as \u201cmind-blowing\u201d to him, saying that following that audition, he \u201cquit the business [and] never went back.\u201d \u201cThat was the last time I auditioned for a role,\u201d he added. Downey Jr. explained that Meyers told him and Fallon, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s great, it\u2019s just not a perfect fit.\u2019\u201d The Holiday follows Winslet\u2019s Iris and Cameron Diaz\u2019s Amanda, who decide to switch places amid their misfortunes with love around Christmastime. While Amanda is across the pond, she meets Iris\u2019s brother Graham, a book editor and single father raising his two daughter. Meanwhile Iris meets Miles (played by Jack Black), a film composer who works with Amanda. While rumors circulated last winter that there would be a sequel, Meyers shut them down, taking to Instagram and writing, \u201cSo many DM\u2019s about this \u2013 sorry but it\u2019s not true. \u2764\ufe0f\u201d The Holiday is available to stream on Starz via Hulu and Prime Video.

            "text": "Actress Vanessa Hudgens was seen Tuesday at Warner Bros. studios, joining fellow actors as they strike for for fairer pay and working conditions. The actress donned a woven, big-brimmed sunhat, big tinted sunglasses, white pants, and a white shirt with the words \"SAG-AFTRA strong\" on it. She also held up a sign with the union's logo on it and the words \"SAG-AFTRA on strike!\" The High School Musical star also posted a picture of herself posing with fellow actresses Rosario Dawson and Alexandra Shipp on Instagram with the caption: \"Union strong.\" Last week, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher announced the union did not reach a compromise with the AMPTP, theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. The SAG-AFTRA national board voted unanimously to strike. \"They plead poverty, that they\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting \u2014 shame on them,\" Drescher said, speaking about the AMPTP. SAG-AFTRA isn't the only union in Hollywood striking, the Writers Guild of America has been on strike since May, leading to no new seasons being written for scripted shows and late-night television to stop filming. This is the first time in over 60 years that both unions have been on strike. Vanessa isn't the only celebrity who's been spotted at the picket line. Kevin Bacon, George Clooney, Jason Sudeikis, and Allison Janney are just a few who've appeared on the front lines to support the cause. George Clooney said in a statement: \"This is an inflection point in our industry. Actors and writers in large numbers have lost their ability to make a living. For our industry to survive that has to change. For actors, that journey starts now.\" Other celebrities have shown their support for the strike, such as Matilda actress Mara Wilson who claimed she's never made enough money for health care while being in show business. Wilson took to Twitter to share that \"thanks to streaming, I have never once made enough to qualify for SAG-AFTRA healthcare.\" The cast of Oppenheimer was at their London premiere when the decision to strike was announced. In solidarity, the actors left the premiere early to \"go and write their picket signs.\" Some television shows aren't affected by the strike, such as The View. Whoopi Goldberg addressed their continuation on the show, saying: \"We work under a different kind of contract, which is called the Network Code, which means we are allowed to continue on.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.",

            "text": "On a crisp autumn day in 1992, President George H.W. Bush\u2019s reelection campaign arrived at my hometown of Wixom, Michigan. Speaking from the rear of a train, President Bush deservedly extolled his achievement of cementing the end to the Cold War through his Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (SALT), which eased people\u2019s fear of nuclear war after an unnerving decades-long arms race. The nuclear narrative traces back to 1945 when J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Manhattan Project yielded the world\u2019s first atomic bomb. It took more than a decade for the world to come together to create the International Atomic Energy Agency to address nuclear safety and security, but by that time, it was too late. President Truman had already detonated two atom bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of people, and fueling a nuclear arms race with the USSR that brought the world to the brink of annihilation. A generation removed from President Bush\u2019s visit, I\u2019m now reminded of the challenges of nuclear arms as we uncover more about the most powerful and perilous technology humanity has ever created, Artificial Intelligence. Leading AI experts recognize its astonishing potential, like curing diseases and tackling climate change, but the dangers are all too real. Even the CEOs of companies leading the charge like OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Google Deepmind\u2019s Demis Hassabis, and Microsoft\u2019s former CEO Bill Gates openly acknowledge them: \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" Over 1,000 technology leaders and experts signed an open letter calling for a six-month moratorium because AI poses \"profound risks to society and humanity.\" OPENAI, MICROSOFT FACE CLASS-ACTION SUIT OVER INTERNET DATA USE FOR AI MODELS Unless safeguards are implemented, leading experts believe AI poses serious civilizational risks like AI-driven autonomous weapons systems that distort the incentives for starting wars, and creation of an artificial general intelligence that works against humanity\u2019s interests. But immediate dangers are beginning to manifest, like the loss of privacy and trust through widespread scams, lies, and deepfakes that sow civil unrest. To build the world\u2019s most transformative technology ever, companies like OpenAI and Google have \"scraped,\" or stolen, an almost inconceivable amount of our personal information\u2014essentially the entire internet\u2014including our creative expressions, professional teachings, copyrighted works, photographs, and our conversations and comments, all of which we\u2019ve communicated to unique communities for specific purposes. By consolidating all this data into one place to \"train\" the AI, they now know everything about us. They can create our digital clones, replicate our voice and likeness, predict and manipulate our next move, and misappropriate our skill sets. They are mining our personhoods to create artificial ones, bringing about our obsolescence, which is at the heart of the strike against the Big Hollywood Studios. SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher recently predicted, \"We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines!\" In reality, screenwriters and actors, like all Labor, are already facing widespread job loss now. We are a progress-driven civilization that all too often asks whether we \"can\" and not whether we should. Why should Big Tech have asked whether we \"should\" this time? Because it is illegal. State and federal laws governing personal property, privacy, copyrights, and consumer protection prohibit this type of theft and commercial misappropriation of our personal information. CAN CHATGPT DISCUSS CURRENT EVENTS? CHATBOT HAS CLEAR KNOWLEDGE CUTOFF DATE Big Tech may claim they legally sourced \"public\" information available on the internet. But \"publicly available\" has never meant \"free to use for any purpose.\" None of us consented to the use of our personal information to train unpredictable, dangerous technologies that put real people\u2019s safety, privacy, and livelihoods at risk. And the Sophie\u2019s Choice we\u2019ve been given of either using the internet but sacrificing all our rights, or simply not using the internet at all, is a false choice. We do not waive our privacy and property rights simply by using the internet to transact business and communicate with family and friends.That\u2019s why last month, we filed suit against OpenAI and Microsoft on behalf of all Americans, including children of all ages, whose personal information was stolen and misappropriated. Three days later, Google updated its Privacy Policy, trying to clarify that it may take our information from anywhere on the Internet whether sourced from their products or not. But that was too little too late\u2014and just plain wrong. So last week, we filed a similar lawsuit against Google. There are two primary goals of the lawsuits. First, we argue that until OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and other tech companies ushering in the Age of AI can demonstrate the safety of their products in the form of effective privacy and property protections, a temporary pause on commercial use and development is necessary. As a society, the price we would pay for negative outcomes with AI like we\u2019ve paid with social media and nuclear weapons is far too steep. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Second, Big Tech must understand that our information has value, and it belongs to us. OpenAI is already valued at $30 billion, and since Google and Microsoft debuted their AI products, their market caps have each increased by hundreds of billions of dollars. That value is almost entirely attributable to the taking of our information, without which their products would be worthless. People are entitled to payment for what was stolen from them, and these companies should be forced to pay the victims \"data dividends,\" or a percentage of revenues, for as long as these AI products generate money from our stolen information. The alternative to data dividends would be algorithmic destruction of the theft-created AI products. Big Tech concedes they do not fully understand the technology spurring the arms race they\u2019ve ignited, yet they\u2019re rapidly entangling it into every aspect of our lives anyway. Big Tech is seizing upon the slow-moving nature of the executive and legislative branches, which were not designed to move as fast as this technology, and they\u2019re trying to take advantage of it before the \"free data\" window closes. That is why the Courts play such a critical role in applying established law to these unprecedented circumstances. I realize that all of this is a lot to process and may sound to some as alarmist. But, when I think about the first atom bomb in 1945, I\u2019m reminded of the numerous lives lost. I think about the precious decade we allowed to pass before creating the IAEA. I reflect on the Cold War that nearly ended human civilization before our retreat from the nuclear arms race. And I think about the experts who tried to warn us. Maybe it would have been different if we\u2019d heeded their warnings and taken steps to protect people from such a dangerous technology.

            "text": "Robert Downey Jr enjoyed dinner at one of London\u2019s most exclusive establishments this week \u2013 the home of actor-turned-foodie Stanley Tucci. The Iron Man star was in town to promote Oppenheimer \u2013 before the actors\u2019 strike put an end to such activities \u2013 when he received the invite of a lifetime from his pal. Both actors shared Instagram round-ups from the evening and quite frankly, they are the sweetest videos we\u2019ve seen in a long time. Robert was one of 12 people who sat down for dinner at \u2018Casa Tucci\u2019, the home of Stanley, his wife Felicity Blunt and their two kids. Prior to serving up the food, Stanley filmed a short clip explaining the meal (he served Cod alla Livornese which is a fancy version of cod with tomatoes, olives and capers, FYI). And despite his foodie credentials, the Devil Wears Prada star appeared adorably nervous at the prospect of cooking for 12 people. Stanley had nothing to worry about though, as Robert\u2019s round-up of the evening proves. He shared a reel set to Frank Sinatra\u2019s When You\u2019re Smiling, which gave fans an extended glimpse at the cooking process, Stanley\u2019s envy-inducing collection of cookware and himself giving the chef a congratulatory kiss. \u201cThis is the collaboration I have needed for my entire life,\u201d reads one fan comment, which we couldn\u2019t agree with more. Another of Robert\u2019s insta followers wrote: \u201cNot sure who is luckier. Stanley getting to hang with Robert, or Robert getting to hang with Stanley?\u201d This is far from the first time that one of Stanley\u2019s friendships with a fellow celeb has delighted fans. Last month, he and wife Felicity danced up a storm at Harry Styles\u2019 London Love On Tour date. The couple are also incredibly close to Felicity\u2019s actor sister Emily Blunt, who introduced them to each other, and her husband John Krasinski.",

            "title": "OBF: Bill Belichick&#8217;s future in the hands of Mac Jones",
            "text": "Cockroaches. Twinkies. Tom Brady. Those three items will be here long after the apocalypse, no matter what Robert Oppenheimer throws at us. It took about three sentences to reach Brady on the DeAndre Hopkins storyline depth chart after the Patriots came up losers in the two-team sweepstakes. The Patriots were outbid, or outclassed, or outhustled, and/or flat out-Patrioted by Tennessee. Remember the Titans? How can we forget? Long gone are the days when Bill Belichick would grunt, or Brady would wink, and players would manifest themselves at the Hertz counter at Logan Airport, ready to play for the Patriots at minimum wage. So many came to New England for whatever terms they could get. Those six Super Bowl rings were bought at an NFL pawn shop and partly financed by Brady\u2019s willingness to adjust his deal to get the next big name. Most of us realize it\u2019s been 1,627 days since the Patriots won a playoff game, and nearly 28 months since Brady jumped ship to Tampa Bay. Guess who isn\u2019t counting? Patriots honks. Bill Belichick. Half of Twitter. The Patriots tried to cheap-skate their way into Hopkins\u2019 heart. He visited Gillette Stadium and broke metaphorical bread with The Hoodie. Whatever offered wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cHopkins only cares about money.\u201d Honk! \u201cHe would never fit in New England.\u201d Honk! \u201cBelichick won six Super Bowls here. What do you want?\u201d Honk! The honks told us nothing would change in New England when Brady left to win another Super Bowl in Florida. Among the other myths: Cam Newton couldn\u2019t miss. Mac Jones was a steal after his rookie season, only to be re-cast as Robert Kraft\u2019s guy after that sophomore slump. Belichick\u2019s sheer genius would deliver a playoff berth with Joe Judge and Matt Patricia running the offense. Now Hopkins is the bad guy because he \u201conly cares about money.\u201d As if Kraft, Belichick, and the Patriots somehow \u201cdon\u2019t care about money.\u201d That notion would be hysterical if it didn\u2019t mask a near-clinical delusion. Even worse, the money argument barely registers here once you look into the Hopkins deal. On the surface, Hopkins has a two-year deal worth up to $32 million with incentives. The Patriots signed Nelson Agholor to a two-year, $22 million deal in 2021 to make 68 catches. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s $24.74 million. If you factor in the state millionaire\u2019s tax, that pushes the real-dollar cost of Agholor\u2019s deal to roughly $26.8 million in 2023. Hopkins offered another case of the Patriots not wanting to pay the market rate for top-tier (31-year-old) talent. Remember, this is the same coach/GM that traded Rob Gronkowski. Twice. Kraft didn\u2019t become a multi-billionaire by not caring about money. Belichick makes at least $20 million a year. That ranks as the highest-paid NFL coach ever. Has Belichick taken a pay cut lately? He should. The current Patriots\u2019 postseason winless streak is their longest such drought in more than 26 years and the deepest during the Kraft regime. The last stint in which New England went more than 1,627 days without winning a postseason game covered nearly 11 years that lapsed between AFC Championship Game victory at the Orange Bowl (\u2018Squish The Fish\u201d) on Jan. 12, 1986, and a playoff win over the Steelers on Jan. 5, 1997. Thanks, coach Parcells. We can\u2019t say that \u201cTom Brady won\u2019t be walking through that door\u201d in Foxboro any time soon because he will be walking through many doors on Sept. 10. The Patriots will illuminate their nifty new lighthouse and ignite that monstrous video board to celebrate the GOAT\u2019s first of many returns to Gillette Stadium. Except Brady isn\u2019t playing. Or is he? Given how nonchalant Belichick and the Patriots have been this offseason, who knows? With or without Brady, we still like the Patriots +4.5 over the Eagles in Week 1. Belichick will game-plan for this contest as if it was Super Bowl 21, 25, 36, 38, 39, 49, 51 and 53 \u2013 combined. Belichick can\u2019t allow himself and his team to be outplayed and outcoached in all three phases while Brady looks on from the Kraft Family box with Robert, the new Mrs. Kraft, Jonathan Kraft, and Jon Bon Jovi. Then what? Week 2 against the Dolphins has \u201changover\u201d written all over it. This brings us to the biggest irony of all. The fate of Belichick in New England now lies in 9 \u00bc-inch hands of Mac Jones. Destiny can be so cruel and delicious at the same time. Call it: \u201cMac To The Future.\u201d The Patriots offense is going to need all the gigawatts it can get. Gone is the DeAndre DeLorean. This roster is more Subaru Outback. Not landing Hopkins gives Team Kraft another count upon which to indict Belichick if the need arises. Kraft took great pains to let it be known that money was not going to be an object when it came to building a competitive team in the suddenly-tough-as-steel AFC East. And Bill is still buying the groceries. The Patriots could well surprise on the upside. Jones can\u2019t get any worse given his Kellerman Cliff dive last season. Basic math demands improvement with Bill O\u2019Brien replacing Judge, Patricia, Howard, Fine and Howard at the head of the offense. Jones passed all the tests during minicamp. The only QB controversy in Foxboro heading into Week 1 will concern Brady\u2019s Week 1 seat in Kraft\u2019s luxury box. Belichick has now let it be known that the Patriots\u2019 receiving corps is satisfactory. Perhaps this year\u2019s offense can boost New England\u2019s 21.4 points-per-game average. And take some pressure off the defense. Thankfully, my job isn\u2019t on the line if it can\u2019t. Bill Speros (@RealOBF and @BillSperos) can be reached at bsperos1@gmail.com",

            "text": "See more: AT&T to pause prior plans to remove lead cables under Lake Tahoe as it works with regulators AT&T shares have taken a beating lately after reporting from the Wall Street Journal keyed in on lead-sheathed cables used historically by the telecommunications industry, which the story said posed health risks. The stock had gone 10 full trading sessions in a row prior to Wednesday without notching a gain, factoring in one session of flat performance. It fell 16.6% over that 10-session stretch, AT&T\u2019s longest without a daily increase since one of equal length that ended Oct. 21, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. AT&T shares were on track to log their largest single-day percentage gain since March 13, 2020, when they rose 10%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Read also: Verizon\u2019s lead \u2018overhang\u2019 may limit dividend increases, analyst says in downgrade The company late Tuesday held a call with analysts and released a legal filing that left Oppenheimer\u2019s Timothy Horan with the sense that the company\u2019s exposure to lead cable was less than Wall Street initially expected, meaning potential removal costs could be lower than he had anticipated. \u201cWe think [AT&T] is being conservative, but less than 10% of its footprint [or about 200,000 miles] are lead-sheathed, three-fourths of which are conduits buried underground that should likely just remain in place,\u201d Horan wrote. \u201cEven cables that are not buried can be left for long periods of time when safely sealed up and labeled. We believe a small minority will need to be removed, but expect [AT&T] to give more details on its earnings call next week, sooner than expected.\u201d He now estimates that the company could incur $2 billion to $20 billion in costs related to its exposure to lead-coated cables, whereas he had thrown out a \u201cbest guess\u201d of $5 billion to $50 billion before Tuesday\u2019s updates. Cowen\u2019s Gregory Williams was also encouraged by the disclosures AT&T made late Tuesday. \u201cNaturally, AT&T could not provide definitive conclusions at this time; however the company summarized the data from the court filing and essentially provided a compelling framework around the allegations,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe framework suggests a high conviction that any lead-clad cable exposure will result in very minimal health, environmental, regulatory, and financial risks, if any risk at all, and something we had suspected over the past few days of our own conversations and research.\u201d Shares of Verizon Communications Inc.

            "text": "If you can\u2019t shake your love of Debbie Gibson, you\u2019re in luck. The pop icon, who first rocked the charts 36 years ago, is the subject of a new Beyond the Music special on QVC+/HSN+. The program sees the star open about the songwriting process as a tie-in to the recent release of her two limited-edition bundles of her latest studio albums \u201cWinterlicious\u201d and \u201cThe Body Remembers\u201d She also takes the stage to perform songs including \u201cMe Not Loving You,\u201d \u201cLegendary,\u201d and \u201cOnly in My Dreams\u201d. Here Gibson takes time from touring to sit down with TV Insider to talk about her longevity and staying inspired to write songs. What was it like being featured in this unique way through a special produced for QVC+/HSN+? Debbie Gibson: I love it. I thought the digital department did a fabulous job, even capturing my fan community. There were lots of in-depth questions answered. The song choices brought some of the old and new. More and more, I was so thrilled. I love having new and unique ways to connect with fans and the audience. So to have this multi-dimensional platform to let people into my world and give them a glimpse behind the scenes was an incredible opportunity. As someone who had so much success early on in their career and over the years, you\u2019re still inspired to make new music. You\u2019re not resting on the laurels of the past. Where do you find your place in the business today? I love that question. It is a lot of nostalgia. I have so much fun celebrating the moments that brought us together in the late \u201880s while presenting to the world something new. There are a lot of varying age ranges in my audience. I get 4 to 94 and everything in between. I think for a lot of people standing at a crossroads, maybe parents with kids going off to college and are ready for the next chapter. Those who are not ready to be put out to pasture. This music for me ignites that feeling in me. I want it to ignite that feeling in everybody. This is a clear second act. I feel everybody can have. I feel that is why the music spoke to me in my life. I wanted to get the music out and tour in this kind of aggressive way. It was aggressive to put two albums out in just over a year, especially because I\u2019m so heavily involved in the production, the business and writing, and everything. It has been a lot of work, but this is what comes with doing everything on my own terms. That\u2019s what is so beautiful about this moment. It\u2019s so pure because I\u2018ve been through the big machine, and it can over time get convoluted with these gatekeepers. The creative vision of the artist can get lost. I love this moment. The same way I was unapologetically 18, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now and it\u2019s resonating with people. That\u2019s rewarding. Along with music, you\u2019ve done a fair amount of TV. What is one show role you remember most or are most proud of? Lucifer was a big one for me. I was never in the cool kids club. But here I am on this show. Tom Ellis and I became friends. He knew me when I was in London and had a lot of respect for me. I was at the top of his list for the role of this helicopter mom. To be in the presence of that greatness on a show that went on for that long and then being able to break out to a Police song with them was everything in one place. I got to use my acting chops. I got to use my singing chops. I was really proud of the whole thing. I know you\u2019re on the road right now. Is there a show you are bingeing? I love Meaghan Oppenheimer\u2019s show Tell Me Lies. The actors are phenomenal. It felt raw and authentic. It\u2019s also every reason why I did not go to college because it tackles every college issue. I was never a big partier. I would have been terribly uncomfortable in these scenarios. Another show I binged before the tour was Daisy Jones & the Six. I loved it so much I started to watch it a second time. When you hear the actors talk about the year of their lives they were learning to sing. They came out of it from the actor-turned-singer perspective. I love they took the time to invest. There is a realness. That show is so patient. It was so authentic. Joey McIntyre and I talk about this all the time. There is dynamic chemistry. Not saying that dynamic will become romantic. Joey is happily married and I would never infringe on that, but there is the emotional connection when you\u2019re on stage or writing a song. There is a romance to it. I felt that was beautifully depicted on that show. Speaking of shows, there is another one out called The Idol. Being a young pop star yourself, how do you feel it is for young pop stars today? I have heard of the show, but haven\u2019t watched it. But it\u2019s funny because I actually had a great group with the likes of Will Wheaton, Alyssa Milano, Corey Feldman, and Corey Haim, who we lost. It was a sense of community. There were more actors than musicians, but I was peripherally in that group because we were all part of that generation. It was a wonderful and innocent time. In music, I had my mom managing me. She was a mama bear. Mama bears are not always liked but respected\u2026I also have my own center that she instilled in me. I never wanted to sell my soul to be higher up on the totem pole. Now we live in a world with such unsolicited feedback, especially for young girls. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not hard for the boys too, but young girls are so prone to body image issues and anxiety. I\u2019ve dealt with that. It\u2019s a lot of unsolicited opinions out there on social media. I don\u2019t think teenagers are wired to handle that much scrutiny. That much intensity they have to handle now. Back then it was intense and a lot to keep up with, but when I was on my tour bus I would be in a bit of a bubble. I joke I\u2019m my own $ 5,000-a-month media company because I do my posting, editing, and stuff. It\u2019s a full-time job and something I love. If you want to engage at a certain level with your audience, you can\u2019t take your take your foot off the gas. How has the tour been? I\u2019ve done 60 shows in the last year. I\u2019m getting to ready to announce more dates. It has been a blast. I have an audience who has been with me from the beginning and reconnected with others. Like on HSN, I just felt so connected to all these generations. I got to be in everyone\u2019s living room for that time It\u2019s not wasted on me. It was all really magical.

            "text": "You watch movies. You watch TV. And now you\u2019re wondering how the dual Hollywood strikes \u2014 a pitched battle with actors and writers on one side, and studios and streaming services on the other \u2014 will affect you. We have answers. Do the strikes mean \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d aren\u2019t coming out? They \u2014 and all other summer releases \u2014 are still on track! Many flashy premieres have been canceled, however, or dramatically scaled down. Am I crossing the picket line by seeing one of those movies? No, the unions have not asked fans to boycott productions, and are quick to make that explicit. Instead, the guilds have asked supporters who aren\u2019t members to post on social media and donate to community funds. Should I cancel Netflix, MAX or the 16 other streaming services I subscribe to if I want to show support? Nope, there\u2019s been no consumer boycott of any kind called yet. Some guild members have said watching their programs on streaming services \u2014 if they\u2019re still on there \u2014 actually helps make their cases to the the studios\u2019 bargaining arm, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. When will I stop being able to watch new movies and shows? That\u2019s the big question: When will the pipeline dry up? There aren\u2019t clear answers. The impact of the writers strike has so far been felt most acutely in the world of television; now, the actors strike has halted the bulk of film production. Your favorite broadcast shows like \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d definitely aren\u2019t coming back by early fall, regardless of whether the strikes are settled by then. Ditto for streaming favorites like \u201cStranger Things. International productions may be able to fill the gap. As for movies, there\u2019s still a steady stream on the horizon. I have a ticket to a play starring my favorite actor. Do the strikes mean the show is going to be canceled? No, stage actors in plays and musicals are governed by the Actors\u2019 Equity Association. A different union altogether, Equity has expressed solidarity with SAG-AFTRA and many actors are members of both unions. But Broadway dances on. I love the Emmys \u2014 will they still air in September? The Emmys are still set for Monday, Sept. 18. But history shows that awards shows that proceed during strikes turn out to be bleak affairs. And Emmy campaigning will certainly be affected \u2014 SAG-AFTRA and WGA members aren\u2019t allowed to take part in \u201cfor your consideration\u201d events under their strike notices and they wouldn\u2019t be able to accept awards for projects produced by struck companies. Can actors still post to social media? The SAG-AFTRA strike website had this advice for members wondering if they were allowed to promote themselves (or post #spon): \u201cYes! Promote yourself as an artist, a fashion icon, a union activist, a commercial actor, and a proud SAG-AFTRA member. You can also promote brands using our groundbreaking Influencer Agreement or start a podcast.\u201d It\u2019s my dream to go to Comic-Con \u2014 will that be affected this year? Honestly, yes. Several show and movie panels have already been canceled and the strike notice forbids SAG-AFTRA members from promoting any work made by struck companies \u2014 even if those projects were long in the past. There are certain exceptions that would allow members to attend some conventions, but the bottom line is that major events like San Diego\u2019s Comic-Con will indeed be diminished during the strikes. Look, the only thing that helps me unwind is watching celebrity interviews on YouTube. What am I going to do when that well dries up? It won\u2019t \u2014 the nature of that content will just be different. Ryan Gosling might not explicitly exude \u201cKenergy\u201d in his interviews, but he\u2019s still allowed to make media appearances (where the \u201cKenergy\u201d might just be innate). Scores of actors and writers alike have been talking to media \u2014 including The Associated Press \u2014 on the picket lines for weeks.",

            "title": "SAG strikers lament lack of A-listers on picket line: \u2018Where the f&#8211;k is Ben Affleck?\u2019",
            "text": "By Holly Aguirre, New York Daily News LOS ANGELES \u2014 By 9 a.m. on Tuesday, hundreds of SAG/AFTRA and WGA members and supporters had gathered outside the Netflix studios on Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood. Armed with signs, water and sunscreen, the picketers represent the 160,000 actors in the Screen Actors Guild who went on strike last week, joining the Writers Guild of America. While there are several bones of contention, the strikers are fed up with lack of residuals from streaming services and threats of having their likenesses used in perpetuity with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for no additional compensation. Some are also frustrated by the lack of an A-lister presence on the picket line. \u201cI would love to know where the one and two percent actors are,\u201d said a SAG member who goes by the Instagram moniker @strikesigns. \u201cThere\u2019s a great sign on the WGA line that says, \u2018Where the f\u2013k is Ben Affleck?\u2019 I\u2019m feeling that way about [some of] our actors,\u201d she said. George Clooney, a two-time Oscar-winner and friend of Affleck, issued a statement in a show of solidarity, and pal Matt Damon walked off the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d red carpet. But for those on the front lines, that\u2019s simply not enough. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between someone making a statement in the air-conditioned splendor of their mansion, and being out here in 90-degree heat, where they\u2019re making a sacrifice with their body to show solidarity,\u201d SAG member Lynn Andrews told the Daily News. \u201cWe\u2019re all here and we can\u2019t pay our rent. So the least you could do is strap up your running shoes and get with it.\u201d SAG member @strikesigns said that she makes it a habit to check the social media posts of her fellow SAG members to see who is at least showing up electronically, but that she is also surprised to see who is not. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Brie Larson post anything. She\u2019s part of \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d works for Disney and just started one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, \u201cFast X,\u201d and she\u2019s typically a very active voice.\u201d Though visibly frustrated, Andrews and @strikesigns both agreed, despite the no-shows, that they are \u201cenergized\u201d by the unity of the two unions, a first since 1960. Actor Ben Kaufman seconded that emotion. \u201cThe executives don\u2019t seem to realize that the actors and writers are now forming bonds that won\u2019t be broken,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cI\u2019ve met so many people that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had we not gone on strike.\u201d Indie filmmaker John Weiner said he believes the strike symbolizes a sea change in the American labor movement, but that it will take time. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it going on for years because I think the whole country needs something like this,\u201d Weiner told The News. \u201cI think everyone needs workers\u2019 revolution, actually.\u201d Referring to the studio CEOs and executives as \u201cbrilliant narcissists,\u201d Weiner said their need to dominate and \u201cstraight-up greed\u201d is what started \u201cthis mess.\u201d \u201cHopefully they\u2019ll figure a way out where they still come off like they\u2019re the heroes, because they\u2019re not going to say, \u2018Oh, you know what, you\u2019re right. You broke me,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not stronger than the strong union. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d Character actor Toby Huss (\u201cWhite House Plumbers,\u201d \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d) agreed with Weiner that studio executives know exactly what they\u2019re doing, referring to leaders as \u201capex predators in this capitalist system.\u201d Huss described what he thinks is a carefully calculated way to hide profits and systematically manipulate loopholes in the system. Huss, who also paints and dabbles in photography, doesn\u2019t hold out hope for a happy Hollywood ending and believes that this will be the strike to end all strikes. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t done now \u2026 big industry will just move on,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if, 10 years from now, acting is going to be a viable profession. Maybe on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that they\u2019re fighting to marginalize writers and actors at this point, while at the same time they\u2019re looking at some real marginalization of their own business model in the future.\u201d Holly Aguirre cut her teeth on the music scene in Athens, Georgia, launching her decades-long career in journalism. Her work has appeared in Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, Esquire, and the Chicago Tribune. A former New Yorker, Holly lives in Los Angeles with her dogs Corky St. Clair and Peaches.",

And now you\u2019re wondering what role you play as a consumer of entertainment amid the dual Hollywood strikes \u2014 a pitched battle with actors and writers on one side, and studios and streaming services on the other. We have answers to how they affect you. Movies slated for release this summer will still hit theaters as planned. Many premieres promoting the films, however, have been cancelled, for one because striking writing actors are banned from advertising their work, which includes attending events like screenings. No boycotts yet But fans can still support the industry by purchasing tickets to highly anticipated summer releases, as the unions have not called for any boycotts of theaters or streaming services. Instead, the guilds have asked supporters who aren\u2019t members to advocate for them on social media and donate to community funds. Some guild members have explicitly said that watching their programs on the streaming services where they are available actually helps their case. While late-night shows remain on the air, no new episodes have been produced since the writers strike began. Other series have banks of unaired episodes to tide them over until striking writers and actors reach agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). When will the pipeline dry up? It\u2019s unclear how much new content there is left to air. So far, the writers\u2019 strike has most seriously affected TV production.

            "title": "Barbie review: Margot Robbie is explosive in Greta Gerwig\u2019s lurid assault on senses",
            "text": "In The Sting, a distinction is made between an everyday piddling backstreet hustle and the fabled \u201cbig con\u201d. This is an operation that costs a great deal of money, involves much expertise and employs many talented actors. George Roy Hill\u2019s 1973 film doesn\u2019t endorse the big con, but it admires the invention and ingenuity involved. There is nothing piddling or backstreet about Greta Gerwig\u2019s rambunctiously lurid assault on senses you didn\u2019t know you possessed. And there is certainly more to Barbie than an act of deceit. The film is much concerned with a sincere effort to interrogate the continuing frustrations of growing up female amid a still-unapologetic patriarchy. Margot Robbie, explosive throughout as the \u201cstereotypical\u201d Barbie, gets to act out some of those concerns as a self-conscious plot spins ever deeper into creative absurdity. But it is America Ferrera, playing a citizen of the real (ish) world, who connects most explicitly with the film\u2019s key concerns. Deep into the confused last act, she delivers a speech that, in remarkably clear-eyed fashion, addresses all the hypocritical paradoxes that pester girls as they pass towards womanhood. You can never do enough, but everything is your fault. You are expected not to get old, but you\u2019re not allowed to complain when you do. Arriving in a film so drenched in irony \u2013 positively drowning in the stuff \u2013 the monologue seems all the more bracing. This Barbie is definitely about something. And yet. There remains a nagging awareness that the screenplay, by the director and Noah Baumbach, is wrapping this discourse around an advertisement for a multinational toy empire that makes billions flogging girls unattainable models of femininity. Does the film address this? Naturally. Gerwig and Baumbach are among the smartest American filmmakers working today. In the opening scenes we hear that \u201cthanks to Barbie\u201d all problems have been solved. You can be doctor Barbie. You can be president Barbie. It\u2019s all a bitter gag, of course. When we meet the fictional board of Mattel, the company that has manufactured the doll since 1959, we find each member a flat-faced bloke. \u201cI\u2019m a man with no power. Does that make me a woman?\u201d one says. So, it\u2019s as much an attack on Barbie as it is a celebration. Right? Well, not really. The product has been on everyone\u2019s lips for the past year. Every promotion for the film is also a promotion for the toy. That comparison with big con is not entirely fanciful. It\u2019s also not entirely a criticism. Like the fanciest of scams, Barbie is carried off with a conviction that deserves sustained applause and occasional loud hoots. The film begins in a plastic world apparently fashioned from giant versions of Mattel\u2019s products. The swimming pool is painted over. The cars move without a noise. Just about every women is a Barbie. Just about every man is a Ken (the most stereotypical of whom is played with bodacious idiocy by Ryan Gosling). The too-perfect world shudders when \u2013 this is not really a kids film \u2013 our main Barbie contemplates death and finds her body taking on hitherto unfamiliar human traits. She travels to fleshy LA and is shocked to find no replica of the idyllic gynocracy from which she has just emerged. The screenplay is positively philosophical at times, drawing distinctions between Barbie as individual and Barbie (or maybe \u201cBarbie\u201d) as genus. But there are also deranged car chases, game comedy routines and musical numbers that gesture to Bob Fosse. And there are moments of raw emotion \u2013 not least those involving Rhea Perlman as reincarnation of the doll\u2019s creator. So, yes, this strange, strange film is a big con, but it\u2019s one you can\u2019t help tipping a pink cowboy hat towards. Who would have thought it would contain more existential musings on death than we find in Oppenheimer?",

            "title": "Suddenly, Everyone Loves The Rally - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "Good morning. Netflix\u2019s freeloader crackdown paid off in the second quarter, driving nearly 6mn new sign-ups. Even that wasn\u2019t enough to impress the market. A miss on revenue pushed the stock down 8 per cent after the close. The story at Tesla looked similar: decent earnings growth was undermined by pinched margins and the stock fell 5 per cent after-hours. The decline in these two superstar stocks is especially striking put against the largely happy market backdrop, more on which below. Email us: robert.armstrong and ethan.wu. Risk on! In the past few weeks, investors\u2019 attitude towards the 2023 rally has flipped from disdain to admiration. Waves of good economic news have turned an unpopular, narrow bear market rally into a broad rally backed by strong sentiment. It\u2019s not just last week\u2019s encouraging inflation report. Economic data has consistently beat out expectations. The Citi Economic Surprise index hit a two-year high yesterday, historically a positive omen for stock returns. Omens aside, the simple fact is that the S&P 500 is up almost 20 per cent this year, and the rally\u2019s foundations look increasingly solid. What began this spring as a lopsided bounce in the magnificent seven tech stocks has, since early June, spread out. After months of top-heaviness, the equal-weight S&P 500 has recently edged ahead of its market-weight cousin. The chart below shows the ratio of the two indices this year: Wider participation in the rally is coinciding with better sentiment about it. The weekly AAII survey of individual investors, which has been stuck in negative territory since late 2021, is suddenly strongly positive. The chart below shows the share of investors feeling bullish less those feeling bearish, on a four-week rolling average: Back in mid-May, when the market was immobile, the only consistent sources of equity demand were corporate buybacks and algorithms. That has changed. Discretionary investors have jumped back into the mix, note Deutsche Bank\u2019s investor-positioning gurus, Parag Thatte, Binky Chadha and Karthik Prabhu. The rise in discretionary participation in the past month or so is \u201ccomparable to those seen after the vaccine announcement in late 2020 and the 2016 presidential election\u201d, they write in a recent note. Across measures they track \u2014 including hedge fund market exposure, options market pricing and retail investor activity \u2014 investors are the most aggressively positioned they\u2019ve been since early 2022: Perhaps the most remarkable recent turnaround in sentiment is in the regional banks that performed the very worst when Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic failed. Western Alliance, Comerica, KeyBank and Zions, which attracted negative attention in March for their large securities losses or concentration of uninsured deposits, or both, have all rallied by 25 per cent or more since the first week of July. Meme stocks and speculative tech are all having a grand time, as well. Since June, the Roundhill Meme and Ark Innovation ETFs are up 35 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. Several of the names in the meme-stock fund are pure-play crypto stocks, which have gained from a bitcoin bounce this year. One interesting point of contrast to the revelry in equities is the Treasury market. Ten-year yields jumped above 4 per cent to start July, but that much-discussed move has fully reverted. Across the curve, yields are trading about where they were pre-SVB. As we wrote last week, the bond market may be waiting for clearer signals of where this rates cycle is headed before making any big moves. But quiet Treasuries aside, financial conditions elsewhere are loosening substantially. Corporate credit spreads are tightening, the dollar is weakening and stocks are rallying while equity and bond volatility indices remain low. The Chicago Federal Reserve national financial conditions index is at its loosest since early 2022. The strong performance of asset prices will feed into consumer demand. Last Friday\u2019s University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey offered a taste of this. The preliminary July numbers showed a huge monthly gain in consumer confidence, putting the index at a two-year high. But as David Rosenberg, the strategist, points out, The jump in consumer finances is purely an asset [appreciation] story \u2014 the share of respondents stating their optimism was due to rising wages (27%) or lower debt (3%) were both unchanged. Those that feel their finances are better off due to rising asset prices has doubled in the past two months \u2014 from 3% in May, to 5% in June, to 7% currently in July. Moreover, the mean probability of higher stock prices a year out rose to 55.1% from 52.5%, the highest since April 2022. So, gains in asset prices, and expectations they will continue to rise, are emboldening the consumer. The dark side of the rally in both prices and sentiment is, of course, that it will give sagging inflation a second wind \u2014 or, at the very least, make the Fed worry seriously about that possibility. It does look more and more likely that the post-Covid inflationary burst was first caused by a supply shock rather than excess demand. But inflation has become entrenched in demand, and so loose financial conditions and euphoric sentiment could help perpetuate it. Investors are loving the rally. The Fed has no choice but to hate it. This dynamic \u2014 rising risk appetite in the foreground, the shadow of inflation and a hawkish Fed in the background \u2014 will make the remainder of this second-quarter earnings season interesting to watch. When expensive, much loved stocks such as Tesla and Netflix post imperfect results, we will discover how much deep the positive sentiment really runs.

            "text": "Amid the hype surrounding the new Barbie film, there\u2019s also been a lot of conversation about whether parents will be able to take their children to see it at the cinema. The film \u2013 starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken \u2013 is (obviously!) based on the Mattel doll of the same name, which has been popular with generations of kids since it first hit shelves in 1959. While most films based on kids\u2019 toys \u2013 like The Lego Movie and Bratz: The Movie \u2013 are usually given a U or PG classification in the UK, the Barbie movie has been rated a 12A. According to the British Board Of Film Classification (BBFC), films given this rating usually contain material that is not generally suitable for children aged under 12. This also means that no one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless they are accompanied by an adult over the age of 18. The BBFC said it gave Barbie the 12A rating because it contains \u201cmoderate innuendo, brief sexual harassment and implied strong language\u201d. It also contains a bleeped-out \u201cmotherfucker\u201d and makes a subtle reference to masturbation. However, according to the cast, the film works on \u201cdifferent levels\u201d for different audiences. During the Barbie press tour, Margot insisted the movie is \u201cfor everyone\u201d, with IMBd quoting her as saying: \u201d[Director Greta Gerwig] said from the beginning, \u2018This is a big party and everyone is invited\u2019. So in that way, it really is for everyone, and the comedy plays on so many different \u2013 the whole movie plays on so many different levels.\u201d Meanwhile, the film has also proved to be a hit with the critics, with reviews heaping praise on the movie\u2019s direction, script and plot, as well as the actors\u2019 performances. Rotten Tomatoes also has Barbie listed on an 89% approval rating. According to The Guardian, Barbie is set to dominate at the box office this weekend, with a projected US opening of $110 million (around \u00a385.2 million), more than double predicted takings of Oppenheimer, which is also released on Friday. Barbie is in UK cinemas from Friday 21 July.",

            "text": "Tamzin Outhwaite said she still hears claims her ex Tom Ellis cheated on her a decade after he \u201cwalked out\u201d on their marriage. The former EastEnders actress wed Tom in 2006, and the couple welcomed two daughters, Florence and Marnie, but they sadly split in 2013. It was reported Tamzin and her husband parted ways after the Lucifer star allegedly confessed to having an affair with Australian actress Emilie de Ravin when they worked on the US TV show Once Upon a Time in 2013. Now, the 52-year-old has claimed she\u2019s uncovering \u201cmore infidelities and lies that he committed\u201d, and took to Twitter to share her fury. \u201cTen years since the father of my kids walked out on us for the final time. I still meet new people on jobs who reveal more infidelities and lies that he committed,\u201d Tamzin wrote. \u201cBut thankfully my heart and soul are clear and clean and I could not be happier right now,\u201d she added. Her famous pals were quick to support her in the comments, with Denise Van Outen writing: \u201cLove you.\u201d However, she soon deleted the post and apologised for \u201ctriggering\u201d any of her followers who were going through similar heartache. \u201cThank you all for your messages re my now deleted tweet. I was marking the 10 year anniversary with pride, a feeling of triumph & genuine gratitude,\u201d Tamzin explained. \u201cI understand it has triggered some people. For anyone struggling, the most important relationship you will ever have is with yourself,\u201d she wrote. Tamzin previously addressed their split in 2015, and suggested the infidelity was a long-term relationship rather than a fling. \u201cI wouldn't not be with my husband over a one-night stand is all I'll say,\u201d she told Essentials magazine. The actress said she didn\u2019t want to disclose the details of Tom\u2019s cheating for fear of upsetting their teenage daughters. \u201cI will tell them exactly what happened and it will come from me. He's still their dad and they still have a relationship,\u201d she stated. Tamzin has since healed her broken heart by finding love with director Tom Child, who she described as \u201cthe best stepdad\u201d to her kids.

            "title": "Why does the Barbie movie have Republicans in such a tizzy?",
            "text": "Be vigilant, everyone. According to conservative lawmakers, Hollywood is attempting to manipulate the American public into consuming Chinese propaganda via subliminal messages about international maritime disputes. The culprit? A movie about dolls. An image from Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie (disclosure: I already have a ticket) has sent rightwing pundits and politicians into an uproar. Senators like Marsha Blackburn and Ted Cruz claim a cartoon map depicts the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d which China uses to assert control over the South China Sea. They argue that the movie\u2019s supposed inclusion of the line legitimizes China\u2019s position, which gives it more power over strategically important waters. (For reference, the map in question is a highly stylized and deliberately inaccurate sketch. It also depicts England as bordering Asia. With a crown on top.) The film\u2019s studio, Warner Bros, responded with a much less convoluted explanation: \u201cThe doodles depict Barbie\u2019s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the \u2018real world\u2019.\u201d Republicans should know a make-believe journey when they see one \u2013 because that\u2019s exactly the leap they make, time and time again, to invent controversies like this. The Barbie scandal is as manufactured as the dolls themselves. It\u2019s the latest and most absurd example of a trend as old as time: conservatives drumming up unnecessary culture wars because they are incapable of winning over voters with their deeply unpopular policies. But just because their claims are absurd doesn\u2019t mean they can be ignored. Because even though many so-called scandals perpetuated by the right aren\u2019t based in reality, they can still result in real harm. Just look at how the GOP has ruthlessly targeted trans people: their baseless lies about the dangers of using the \u201cwrong\u201d bathroom or playing the \u201cwrong\u201d sport have led to the stripping away of gender-affirming care, prohibitions against trans people using bathrooms that align with their gender identity, and bans on trans kids kicking around a soccer ball at school. What starts as laughable paranoia can become lethal policy. Back in Barbie Land, Republicans\u2019 insistence on fabricating culture war issues isn\u2019t limited to disputes over territorial seas. Ginger Luckey Gaetz, the 26-year-old wife of Representative Matt Gaetz, knocked the movie because it \u201cneglects to address any notion of faith or family\u201d. She also lamented the \u201cdisappointingly low T from Ken,\u201d Barbie\u2019s famously genital-free companion. This isn\u2019t even the first Barbie-based trans controversy that the right has attempted to gin up recently. When Mattel released a doll inspired by Laverne Cox last year, the Daily Signal called it a \u201cdangerous message\u201d for kids \u2013 and the anti-LGBTQ+ hate group the American Family Association accused Mattel of grooming. As it turns out, conservatives have a long record of being offended by women like Barbie and the aspirations she represents. With more than 250 careers under her belt, Barbie is often perceived as \u201ca symbol of female empowerment\u201d \u2013 so is it any wonder that she\u2019s an easy target for reactionary backlash? While Barbie is (sometimes imperfectly) agitating for gender justice, Republicans are trying to confine her to the Dream House kitchen. They have blocked the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, voted against the Violence Against Women Act, slashed access to reproductive care, and more \u2013 all within the last three years. In other words: if Astronaut Barbie wants to study aerospace engineering, she can\u2019t afford to \u2013 because Republicans successfully challenged relief for student debt, which disproportionately burdens women. Teacher Barbie may start her career with a vision to educate the next generation, only to be driven out of the profession when her red-state governor busts her union. And how can Paramedic Barbie save lives when she can\u2019t afford childcare because conservative state lawmakers razed subsidies? On issue after issue, Republicans have fought to undermine Barbie\u2019s motto: \u201cWe girls can do anything.\u201d A fantastical theory connecting Margot Robbie to the South China Sea is far less sinister than the grim, narrow reality of the future conservatives want for women. It\u2019s only natural that they\u2019re targeting Barbie because, as Mattel\u2019s most recent slogan goes, Barbie wants girls to imagine the possibilities \u2013 and for conservatives, those possibilities are unimaginable. So ignore their sleight of hand and stay focused on what really matters: whether to see Barbie before or after Oppenheimer (after) \u2013 and more importantly, how to make serious, sustained progress for all the would-be Barbies across America. In short, to paraphrase the movie\u2019s tagline: She\u2019s everything. He\u2019s just Ted. Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation",

            "text": "Swimming Pool Anybody who has tried to multitask over a Zoom-assisted summer of late will find much to relate to in Swimming Pool, French director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s first English language feature, about a working holiday that is anything but relaxing. British crime novelist Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) has hit a creative wall, and retreats to her smarmy publisher\u2019s summer home in the south of France. Nothing like a change of scenery to help a hit-maker press the refresh button. Our belted-up, beige-clad protagonist stocks up on tubs of yogurt and clacks away at her computer, determined to rack up a handsome word count. But the stultifying heat and the sensuality rising from the home\u2019s other resident, the libertine daughter that her publisher never mentioned having, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), wear away at Sarah\u2019s calcified bearing (\u201cshe has a broomstick up her butt,\u201d per Julie). Over these sweltering weeks, Sarah opens her hooded eyes and comes undone, and not just because she starts swilling gin and stabbing at midday profiteroles with a grapefruit spoon. Ozon\u2019s depiction of Sarah\u2019s awakening is electric, and rendered in a style that is, rather miraculously, both languid and taut. The film is bookended by scenes in an office, an unwelcome reminder that the laws of gravity apply to even the most gorgeously dizzying of dreams. Lauren Mechling Summertime It\u2019s lovely to have a summer fling, and even nicer if you learn something about yourself in the process. But David Lean\u2019s Summertime, anchored by a frantic, fearless Katharine Hepburn, takes romantic Roman Holiday cliches several shades darker. Hepburn plays a retired American secretary who blows her savings on a solo trip to Venice and plunges into the city with abandon. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s over-compensating for something, which of course she is. Privately, and not-so-privately too, she is gripped by crippling loneliness and manic mood swings that send her from giddy laughter to tears. She yearns for romance which she finds, perhaps a little too quickly, in a smooth-talking wheeler-dealer played by Rossano Brazzi (AKA heaven on a stick). As inviting as her paramour is Venice itself, a Technicolor fantasy with charming pensioni and gondoliers with the manners of a Jane Austen gent. Hepburn gives the sun-drenched melodrama its modernity and its bite; she is as arresting as an ice cube down your back on a sweaty day. Owen Myers The Inkwell Because I was raised by Jamaican immigrants in the midwest, I had no idea Black families retreated to their own little corner of Martha\u2019s Vineyard every summer until this 90s cult classic. In it, a troubled teen shrinks from a beachy Fourth of July hangout with upper-crust kinfolk only to wind up falling in love and coming of age. The all-Black cast mixes acting royalty (Joe Morton, Vanessa Bell Calloway) and up-and-comers (Jada Pinkett, Morris Chestnut) with the Heath Ledger of Black romcom leading men \u2013 Love Jones\u2019s Larenz Tate. But the thing that still makes this Terence Blanchard-scored film so special is how it lets the Black people in it just be. Sure, they have their political and cultural differences but for the most part The Inkwell has the unhurried vibe of an all-white indie project. It\u2019s a shame there aren\u2019t more like it, and that Matty Rich hasn\u2019t directed another feature since. Andrew Lawrence Mid-August Lunch Four very elderly women trapped in a Rome flat at the height of summer sounds like a disaster movie. And did I mention it was made by the men behind Gomorrah? Yet there are no gruesome shootings nor vivid depictions of dehydration in Mid-August Lunch. Rather, these fabulously coiffured nonagenarians are cosseted in fine style, their every appetite catered for by the beleaguered son of one of them \u2013 lumbered with three extra in exchange for waived rent and medical bills. Once he relaxes, with the aid of wine and a tramp, they all have a great time, chatting and squabbling over pasta and asti. Gianni Di Gregori\u2019s comedy is more of a meal than it first seems. It\u2019s about compassion and respect, as well as good cheese and bad telly. In a climate like today\u2019s, it\u2019s quite a sorbet. Catherine Shoard Do the Right Thing It\u2019s the hottest day of the summer in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, and Do the Right Thing opens with Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy (Samuel L Jackson) issuing a \u201cJheri curl alert\u201d: \u201cIf you have a Jheri Curl, stay in the house or you\u2019ll end up with a permanent plastic helmet on your head forever.\u201d In Spike Lee\u2019s slice-of-life, the temperature climbs near 100 degrees. Children commandeer the fire hydrants as makeshift sprinklers. Bodies glisten with sweat and melt ice cubes, but it\u2019s too hot for sex. And the racial tensions that perpetually simmer in the city are about to boil over. Does Lee\u2019s Mookie throw the trash can through the window of Sal\u2019s Famous on a cooler day? Perhaps not. But through the lens of cinematographer Ernest Dickerson, Do the Right Thing pops with colors that suggest both the vibrancy and the volatility of a neighborhood on the brink. Scott Tobias Now and Then There\u2019s something visceral about Now and Then. Just the mention of the film and I can smell the freshly cut grass, hear the Archies\u2019 Sugar, Sugar, feel my sticky ice-pop-coated hands, and see faint bruises on legs, surely from running down the street and hopping on my bike to make it home before dinner. If you haven\u2019t seen the 1995 classic, it\u2019s a coming-of-age dramedy that follows four female friends over the course of a summer when they were kids and their subsequent reunion some decades later. It toggles back and forth between the 70s and the 90s, providing plenty of laughs interspersed with heart-wrenching moments of maturation. While I\u2019ll be irrevocably angry that they cast Rosie O\u2019Donnell as Christina Ricci\u2019s elder counterpart, there\u2019s no other film that better captures the simultaneous anguish and joy that comes with girlhood. Come for the A-list cast (it also stars Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith and 90s heartthrob Devon Sawa!) and stay for the nostalgia: every young person who grew up in suburbia, in any decade can take away something wonderful from the film. Jenna Amatulli My Summer of Love The most memorable summers of our youth had a breathtaking sense of cinema to them, as if our lives had suddenly expanded to widescreen, the scenery that much richer, our emotions that much bigger. In Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s seductive Yorkshire-set Bafta-winner My Summer of Love, the dull, washed-out grind of one girl\u2019s life \u2013 lonely, listless and lumped with a born-again ex-con brother turning their pub into a church \u2013 is given a lush, high-definition upgrade when she meets another from the other, posher side of the moors. For Mona, played by an exquisite Natalie Press, the grandiose, Edith Piaf-soundtracked life of Tamsin, a star-making turn from a young Emily Blunt, is as desirable as it is dangerous, igniting her sexuality but obscuring her better instincts. It\u2019s a short, bittersweet and haunting little movie, alluringly scored by Goldfrapp, about the fires we choose to play with and the burns we then learn to accept. Benjamin Lee Adventureland The Summer That Everything Changed is a time-honored subset of the cinematic bildungsroman, but in Greg Mottola\u2019s understated and infinitely quotable snapshot of post-collegiate ennui circa 1987, our boy James (Jesse Eisenberg in a persona-setting role) comes of age with more nuance than most. Fresh out of Oberlin and flat broke, he\u2019s forced to spend the hot months minimum-waging it at his hometown amusement park, a set-up that would imply a familiar set of Hollywood hijinks. Mottola doesn\u2019t so much defy the typical components of this comedy subgenre as he hones them to a finer point, crafting true-to-life characters and placing them in a recognizable past shaped by smartly deployed cultural markers. And on top of that: a no-skips soundtrack of the era\u2019s choicest indie rock cuts, the first documented evidence that Kristen Stewart is a great actor, and Martin Starr as a self-proclaimed \u201cpragmatic nihilist, I guess, or an existential pagan, if you will\u201d who smokes a pipe and muses on Melville. Charles Bramesco Double Indemnity Billy Wilder\u2019s iconic caper, about a couple plotting murder over iced tea and bourbon, doesn\u2019t oversell its summer vibes. It doesn\u2019t have to. Barbara Stanwyck turns up the heat the moment her femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson enters the frame. Fresh from sunbathing, she\u2019s wearing only a towel and a dangerously inquisitive smile. Stanwyck\u2019s performance is monumental: an awe-inspiring modulation of ease and precision as when she slinks into a sofa seat in her summer dress with a carefully calculated leg cross or gently leans into a helpless pout to lure Fred McMurray\u2019s insurance agent Walter Neff. McMurray is great too as the hapless man thinking he\u2019s got his hands on the steering wheel, not realizing Phyllis already clipped the brakes. They make a meal of Raymond Chandler\u2019s pulpy dialogue in a movie playing a sinful and steamy (but Hays Code compliant) game of domination and desire. Double Indemnity set the bar for film noir. Wilder established the shadowy venetian blind aesthetics and the femme fatale pedigree. And the movie tapped into contemporary anxieties over war, modern capitalism, power-tripping men, unchecked ambition and blondes sticking it to the patriarchy long before Barbie met Oppenheimer. Radheyan Simonpillai Tu Dors Nicole There are better and more iconic summer movies, like the one about the rampaging shark or the one set on the hottest day of the year in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. But between annual rewatches of those classics, spare a balmy July evening for the itchy melancholia of Tu Dors Nicole (translation: You\u2019re Sleeping, Nicole), a summer movie for those whose seasonal affective disorder hits during the warmer weeks. Shot on a crisp black-and-white that enhances the drab uneventfulness of its plot, St\u00e9phane Lafleur\u2019s sublimely bittersweet French-Canadian comedy follows a recent college graduate (Julianne C\u00f4t\u00e9) as she ambles through a summer without plans or direction, casually stealing from the thrift store that employs her, nursing an unrequited crush, and drifting apart from her best friend. With dry amusement, the movie gets at how sad and lonely and even boring summer can be when your life is stuck in a rut \u2013 how the endless downtime of the season can feel like purgatory when you\u2019ve got nothing to do and no way to fill the hours. Lots of movies make summer look like a vacation you\u2019d never want to end, all skinny dipping and ice-cream. Here\u2019s one that recognizes that fantasy for what it too often is: a shimmering mirage of the fun you\u2019re supposed to be having while the weather and your schedule permits. AA Dowd The Green Ray Maybe no other movie feels like summer to me as much as the French New Wave director \u00c9ric Rohmer\u2019s The Green Ray (often called Summer in North America). It centers around Delphine, a young woman who struggles to find her place as Paris empties for the summer holidays. As with the best of Rohmer, the film lives and breathes the stuff of the everyday, somehow imbuing it with a sense of significance. On one level, the film is a spectacular portrait of a woman in search of something she isn\u2019t quite sure of; on another level, it effortlessly captures that summer restlessness to be somewhere with someone. It all ties together with the magical \u201cgreen ray\u201d, which is said to appear for the lucky few just as the sun disappears for the night. Veronica Esposito",

            "text": "If you\u2019re seeing Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that\u2019s already five hours of story. Most likely, you\u2019re also having drinks with friends in between showings, grabbing a bite of real food (no shade to popcorn!), and maybe even fitting in a power nap. Barbenheimer plans need to be sorted by the hour, so time is of the essence. Just like other recent films that were prime material for post-credits teases\u2014such as Mission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u2014Barbie also resists the bug to set up a sequel and/or shared-universe plans, so you can get on with your busy day. Take it from us: not much occurs after the credits roll, except for another couple needle drops from Mark Ronson\u2019s amazing soundtrack. Still, that alone may be worth staying in your seat. We\u2019re talking about songs from Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, PinkPantheress, Billie Eillish, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Lizzo, HAIM, Tame Impala, Sam Smith, and more. Damn! I promise that if Barbie returns for a sequel, I\u2019ll let you know. If Mattel announces an Avengers-esque toy-movie universe where Barbie rides Hot Wheels and plays Uno with Polly Pocket? Again, I\u2019ll let you know. Immediately. I\u2019ll write about the color of the Hot Wheels car, if it has cool decals, and if it does a big loop. I\u2019ll tell you which Uno cards Barbie has, if Polly Pocket is about to hit her with the dreaded Draw Four, and if Ken can even tell what the cards mean. I got this. So go home and get some rest, because seeing a double-feature like Barbenheimer will certainly push back your bedtime. I\u2019m here for you, reader.",

            "text": "Thanks to a Wednesday haul of another $4.5 million, Angel Studios\u2019 Sound of Freedom has crossed the magic $100 million mark at the domestic box office. \u201cAngel Studios, the platform empowering filmmakers with full creative control to crowdfund and create, has reached a new theatrical milestone,\u201d the studio said in a statement released Thursday. \u201cIts independent summer hit, SOUND of FREEDOM. has now sold over 8.9 million tickets, and the film has now passed $100M in box office revenue.\u201d \u201cSince the films\u2019 July 4 release, SOUND of FREEDOM has never left the top 3 positions on the charts[.]\u201d On Wednesday, after 16 days of release, Sound of Freedom also managed to nearly top Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One once again, which is only in its eighth day of release \u2014 $4.37 million for Dead Reckoning\u2019s Wednesday haul compared to Sound of Freedom\u2019s $4.5 million. But. As Breitbart News reported Tuesday, Tom Cruise\u2019s seventh outing as Ethan Hunt enjoys the advantage of playing in 1,000+ more screens\u20144,327 to 3,265. So, as far as packing in the crowds on a per-screen average, Jim Caviezel\u2019s $14.5 million movie is beating Tom Cruise\u2019s $250 to $300 million blockbuster, and doing so after being in wide release a week longer. Currently, Sound of Freedom is the second most popular movie in the country and there are no signs it will slow down. Barbie and Oppenheimer open this weekend, but just as we saw with Dead Reckoning the previous weekend, Sound of Freedom is operating in a lane all of its own. The anti-child trafficking movie (a topic the pro-grooming left finds offensive and controversial) is bringing normal people back to movie theaters. I\u2019ve talked to all kinds of people who long ago divorced mainstream Hollywood and have or intend to see Sound of Freedom. Top Gun: Maverick did the same last year. Normal people are craving normal entertainment. No gay sex. No smug lectures about the patriarchy. No deconstructing our heroes. No Mary Sues. Normal people want good stories created around interesting and complicated characters. Hollywood did this without breaking a sweat for a hundred years. Now a normal movie is an exception in an ocean of woketardery, shaming, and the normalization of destructive neuroses and perversions. Angel Studios, the distributor also behind the streaming phenomenon The Chosen, has a real opportunity here. Its brand is now associated with a quality product that normal people can enjoy. Hopefully, Angel will use this moment to leverage that reputation and keep the momentum going, but keep it going with quality and not content simply marked \u201cChristian\u201d or \u201cconservative.\u201d That\u2019s not enough. Christians and conservatives want good movies, great stories, iconic characters, and compelling themes first\u2026 A far second place is hitting our religious or political sweet spot. Right or left, no one is entertained or emotionally moved by movies driven by rhetoric. If you want to make $100 million, you have to move and thrill us. You have to cast a spell and hold it. No one remembers what art told them. Everyone remembers how art made them feel. By all accounts, Sound of Freedom is a quality movie about an important subject that\u2019s making a fortune and driving the left-wing establishment crazy. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that. I suspect Disney will soon produce a remake where the sex traffickers are the heroes rescuing children from their traditional parents. Yes, the liberation of gay sex to unshackle the suffocating tenets of the Christian Faith. Coming soon to an empty theater near you. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

            "text": "AMC Entertainment dropped its plans to charge customers variable prices for movie theater seats. The company announced its \u201cSightline\u201d pricing strategy in February and tested it out at select locations in three U.S. markets. The program charged moviegoers more for the best theater seats, or \u201cPreferred Sightline\u201d seats. The program also reduced the price of seats deemed less attractive to patrons, such as those located at the front row of theaters. The change comes as the movie theater industry suffers through a sluggish summer blockbuster season. And theaters are banking on this weekend\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d releases to bring much-needed foot traffic to theaters. Shares of AMC Entertainment fell less than 1% on Thursday. The stock is up more than 5% this year, lagging the broader market. Preferred Sightline seats included select locations in the middle of the auditorium that are preferred by some moviegoers, whereas Value Sightline seats were those typically located in the front row. The chain said the program would end at participating locations in the coming weeks. The decision comes after the pilot program showed moviegoers had little or no interest sitting at the front row, even though prices were reduced. The company said it also found that most moviegoers continued to choose the seats they preferred, even at higher prices. The company added that the pivot is to ensure AMC\u2019s ticket prices remain competitive. Other theater chains like Regal are not charging higher prices for better seats. The cinema chain said its focus will now be to test front row seating with more comfortable recliners in select locations in the United States later this year. CNBC reached out to AMC for additional comment.",

Don Hancock with the Albuquerque-based nuclear watchdog group Southwest Research and Information Center said the DOE in 2010 had issued a roadmap that included a goal of disposing of most of the transuranic waste \u2014 that which contains manmade elements heavier than uranium \u2014 by the end of 2015. He asked the DOE officials at the forum about the timeline and how much waste remained. Mikolanis said his office plans to unveil an interactive map this fall that will include estimates of the waste at Los Alamos that is stored above ground and that which has yet to be unearthed. White said estimates for the cleanup project nationwide are hard to calculate because the ultimate volume of waste can change depending on the scope of a project.

            "text": "Tamzin Outhwaite says she has finally learned to accept herself at the age of 52. The former EastEnders actress revealed she embarked on a health overhaul after hitting menopause and at last feels comfortable in her own skin. Speaking to The Sun she said: 'I'm now at a stage in my life where I have become really comfortable in my own skin and really like myself,' And despite being 'realistic' about her body after reaching the menopause, she revealed that she was in the best shape of her life. It comes after Tamsin marked 10 years since her ex-husband and father of her children Lucifer actor Tom Ellis 'walked out on us' before claiming she was still uncovering 'more infidelities and lies that he committed'. She then went on to say that ditching alcohol amid her health kick was a 'new lease of life'. 'I know exactly who I am, what I'm doing and I'm confident physically and mentally with that.' She then went on to discuss her relationship of five years with personal trainer Tom Child, 32. She admitted that the 20-year age gap wasn't an issue and that him having no desire to have his own children also makes this less complicated. 'There's no pressure, we are not getting married so we have a lovely time. There is no clock ticking, which is very liberating.' They met at a yoga class in 2017. He now lives with the star and her two daughters, and she has previously described him as 'the best' stepdad to the girls. Tamzin and ex-husband Tom, 44, married in 2006 and went on to have two children; Florence, 15, and Marnie, 10, before splitting in 2013. The marriage is understood to have ended after he confessed to an affair with Australian actress Emilie de Ravin, best known for her role as Claire Littleton in Lost, while they worked together on US TV show Once Upon A Time in 2013. But in a now deleted Tweet posted on Wednesday, Tamzin said she was still hearing more stories of Tom's alleged infidelity that took place during their nine year marriage. Tamzin wrote: 'Ten years since the father of my kids walked out on us for the final time. I still meet new people on jobs who reveal more infidelities and lies that he committed. 'But thankfully my heart and soul are clear and clean and I could not be happier right now.' Denise Van Outen commented: 'Love you'. The EastEnders actress later deleted the Tweet and told her followers she marked the decade since her marriage broke down because she felt a 'feeling of triumph and pride' having made it through her heartache. She said: 'Thank you all for your messages re my now deleted tweet. 'I was marking the 10 year anniversary with pride, a feeling of triumph & genuine gratitude. 'I understand it has triggered some people. For anyone struggling, the most important relationship you will ever have is with yourself.' MailOnline has contacted Tom's representatives for comment. Tamzin had been introduced to Tom in 2005 by his old friend, the actor James McAvoy, who was appearing on stage with the actress. After nine years of marriage, they were granted a quick divorce in 2014 - leaving Tamzin heartbroken. 'Tamzin couldn't believe Tom's betrayal and was distraught,' a source told The Sun in 2016. 'She was excited for him to go over to America and -further his career off the back of Miranda while she raised their two daughters and this is how he repaid her.' Tamzin told Essentials magazine in 2015: 'I wouldn't not be with my husband over a one-night stand is all I'll say' - hinting that their split was the result of more than just a single mistake. The actress said she didn't want to reveal the precise details of their troubles for fear of hurting their kids. She added: 'I will tell them exactly what happened and it will come from me. He's still their dad and they still have a relationship.' Tom has since made a name for himself in the US, playing the devil incarnate in TV drama series Lucifer. He married screenwriter Meaghan Oppenheimer, who is the creator of Facebook Watch comedy Queen America, in 2019.",

            "text": "Article content Cineplex says more than 60,000 advance tickets were purchased by moviegoers seeing both films, and 65 per cent of those ticket buyers will watch \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d on the same day. The excitement over the double feature has been dubbed \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as both movies and their box office showdown trend online. A media analyst recently told The Associated Press that \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is a \u201cmarketing gift borne out of social media\u201d and the hype is benefiting both movies and the studios behind them. Cineplex says two days before opening \u201cBarbie\u201d had 200,000 ticket presales in Canada and was head-to-head with last year\u2019s box office hit \u201cAvatar: The Way of the Water,\u201d which had more than 215,000 ticket presales.",

            "title": "Trinity nuclear test\u2019s fallout reached 46 US states, Canada and Mexico, study finds",
            "text": "Written by Lesley M M Blume In July 1945, as J Robert Oppenheimer and the other researchers of the Manhattan Project prepared to test their brand-new atomic bomb in a New Mexico desert, they knew relatively little about how that mega-weapon would behave. On July 16, when the plutonium-implosion device was set off atop a 100-foot metal tower in a test code-named \u201cTrinity,\u201d the resultant blast was much stronger than anticipated. The irradiated mushroom cloud also went many times higher into the atmosphere than expected: some 50,000 to 70,000 feet. Where it would ultimately go was anyone\u2019s guess. A new study, released Thursday before submission to a scientific journal for peer review, shows that the cloud and its fallout went farther than anyone in the Manhattan Project had imagined in 1945. Using state-of-the-art modelling software and recently uncovered historical weather data, the study\u2019s authors say that radioactive fallout from the Trinity test reached 46 states, Canada and Mexico within 10 days of detonation. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge finding and, at the same time, it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, S\u00e9bastien Philippe, a researcher and scientist at Princeton University\u2019s Program on Science and Global Security. The study also reanalysed fallout from all 93 aboveground US atomic tests in Nevada and created a map depicting composite deposition of radioactive material across the contiguous US (The team also hopes to study US tests over the Pacific Ocean in the future). How much of Trinity\u2019s fallout still remains at original deposition sites across the country is difficult to calculate, said Susan Alzner, an author of the study and the co-founder of shift7, an organisation that coordinated the study\u2019s research. The study documents deposition as it originally hit the ground in 1945. \u201cIt\u2019s a frozen-in-time image,\u201d she said. The findings could be cited by advocates aiming to increase the number of people eligible for compensation by the federal government for potential exposure to radiation from atmospheric nuclear explosions. The drift of the Trinity cloud was monitored by Manhattan Project physicists and doctors, but they underestimated its reach. \u201cThey were aware that there were radioactive hazards, but they were thinking about acute risk in the areas around the immediate detonation site,\u201d Alex Wellerstein, a nuclear historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, said. They had little understanding, he said, about how the radioactive materials could embed in ecosystems, near and far. \u201cThey were not really thinking about effects of low doses on large populations, which is exactly what the fallout problem is.\u201d In the decades that followed, a lack of crucial data bedeviled assessments and attempted studies of the Trinity test\u2019s fallout. The US had no national monitoring stations in place in 1945 to track the fallout, Philippe said. Plus, essential historical weather and atmospheric data was available only from 1948 onward. Remodelling fallout from tests in Nevada \u2014 starting in 1951 \u2014 was easier, but Trinity remained frustratingly difficult to reanalyse. \u201cThe data sets for the Nevada tests and the available data that we could possibly find for Trinity were not comparable,\u201d Alzner said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t put them on the same map. We decided to keep pushing.\u201d Determined to fill in the gaps, the team started the study about 18 months ago. Philippe has extensive background in modelling fallout and was an author of a similar project in 2021 that documented the effects from French nuclear tests. A breakthrough came in March, when Alzner and Megan Smith, another co-founder of shift7 and a former US chief technology officer in the Obama administration, contacted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. There, Gilbert P. Compo, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado and the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory, told the team the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts had only a week earlier released historical data that charted weather patterns extending 30,000 feet or higher above Earth\u2019s surface. \u201cFor the first time, we had the most accurate hourly reconstruction of the weather back to 1940, around the world,\u201d said Compo, who became a co-author on the study. \u201cEvery single event that puts something in the air, no matter what it is, can now be tracked, by the hour.\u201d Using the new data and software built by NOAA, Philippe then reanalysed Trinity\u2019s fallout. And while the study\u2019s authors acknowledge limitations and uncertainties within their calculations, they maintain that \u201cour estimates likely remain conservatively low.\u201d The results show that New Mexico was heavily affected by Trinity\u2019s fallout. Computations by Philippe and his colleagues show the cloud\u2019s trajectory primarily spreading up over northeast New Mexico and a part of the cloud circling to the south and west of ground zero over the next few days. The researchers wrote that there are \u201clocations in New Mexico where radionuclide deposition reached levels on par with Nevada.\u201d Trinity\u2019s fallout, Philippe says, accounts for 87% of total deposition found across New Mexico, which also received deposition from Nevada\u2019s aboveground tests. The study also found that Socorro County \u2014 where the Trinity test took place \u2014 has the fifth highest deposition per county of all counties in the United States. Trinity test \u201cdownwinders\u201d \u2014 a term describing people who have lived near nuclear test sites and may have been exposed to deadly radioactive fallout \u2014 have never been eligible for compensation under the 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). It has provided over $2.5 billion in payments to nuclear workers in much of the Western US and to downwinders who were located near the Nevada test site and may have developed cancer or other diseases as a result of radiation exposure.",

            "title": "It's in the genes! Nicole Kidman's 'nepo-baby' niece Lucia Hawley looks just like her famous aunt as...",
            "text": "Her aunt has one of the most famous faces in the world. And Nicole Kidman's niece Lucia Hawley looked the spitting image of the Hollywood star as she graced the red carpet for not one, but two movie premieres this week. Lucia had a busy week attending the premiere of Barbie and Oppenheimer in Sydney - with both films going head-to-head at the box office. To watch Margot Robbie's new movie about the iconic Mattel doll, Lucia channelled The Hours star in a chic suit. The brunette beauty looked incredibly chic and statuesque in a baby blue blazer and matching trousers. She teamed the stylish two-piece with a white tank top and matching Tony Bianco heels. Lucia even did one of Nicole's signature poses - standing tall with her hands clasped in front of her. Lucia signed with major talent management agency Chic Talent after she landed a new plum gig as a red carpet reporter for the E! network. The company shared the good news on social media, welcoming Hawley to their stable of stars. Incredibly excited to announce the signing of [Lucia]to our roster,' they announced. 'Lucia is the new host of the iconic Live from E! red carpet coverage for 7Bravo.' Lucia is the daughter of Antonia Kidman, a former television presenter-turned-lawyer who is the sister of Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman. Her grandfather was Antony Kidman, the late Australian psychologist and academic, who died from a heart attack in 2014 at age 75. Lucia recently explained why she shouldn't be labelled a 'nepo baby' despite her enviable showbiz connections. As the new face of Live From E!, the aspiring journalist will attend the biggest events in Australia, interviewing celebrities and reporting on the hottest fashion moments. While some may accuse Lucia of using her 'nepo baby' connections to further her media career, she insisted she worked hard to land her 'dream job'. 'I've been working towards this,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. The term 'nepo baby', short for 'nepotism baby', stems from a recent article published by New York magazine calling out U.S. celebrities who used their famous parents and relatives to build their careers. Among those named were Jaden Smith, the son of actors Will and Jada Pinkett Smith; Zo\u00eb Kravitz, the daughter of rock star Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet; and Maya Hawke, whose parents are actors Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. While the phenomenon is nothing new, the term 'nepo baby' has become an increasingly popular term to describe it. In her interview, Lucia did admit her mother's work as a TV presenter was beneficial for her career, but only because it taught her 'perspective' rather than opening doors. 'Having a mum who had been in the industry, through osmosis you gain that perspective and understanding and I think that's been one of the biggest things that has helped in preparing me for this role, just having watched her and how she has carried herself through everything,' she said. Lucia previously covered the ARIA Awards for 9Honey when she was employed as an Associate Producer, a role she held from October 2021. According to her LinkedIn, before joining Nine she was employed as a production assistant at McAvoy Media for eight months. She holds a Bachelor of Arts from the prestigious University of Sydney, where she majored in socio-legal studies.",

Bangladesh will play against Sri Lanka in Pakistan. Bangladesh, who are in Group B, will play their group phase matches in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, respectively. Dubai: Amid much controversy, the Asia Cup 2023 schedule was officially announced on Wednesday by the Asian Cricket Council. While there was a lot of talk over PCB showing their reluctance over the hybrid model which they had acceptd earlier, the ACC stuck to the schedule that was decided on where Pakistan host four matches and Sri Lanka will host nine games. Now that the schedule is announced, the Bangladesh Cricket Board is not too pleased with it as they would be playing in Pakistan and in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh are in Group B in the Asia Cup where they are pitted against Sri Lanka. Bangladesh will play against Sri Lanka in Pakistan. \u201cYes, we must travel to Lahore for the first match. The first round has two matches, one in Sri Lanka and one in Pakistan. We have to leave because we can\u2019t do anything else. The next match after August 31st is on September 3rd. The Asia Cup organisers [ACC] have opted to fly the teams in chartered flights to make the journey more comfortable. We will fly in hired flights. The Asian Cricket Council is in charge of this. Of course, we would like to go by excellent airline, whether it is a national airline or a chartered plane; either way, it would be beneficial to everyone,\u201d Jalal Yunus, chairman of the BCB cricket operation, told media at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. \u201cIf you travel, there will undoubtedly be an impact that I feel because if you travel by air, you will have to arrive two hours earlier and carry your luggage, and preparing all of these things is mentally stressful. Pakistan is a long distance away from Sri Lanka. So there is nothing to be done because it is the ACC\u2019s decision, and everyone is acting accordingly. We must accept it as well,\u201d he added.
